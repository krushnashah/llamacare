    "abstract": "The qualitative analysis of adipose tissue (AT) is an exciting area for research and clinical applications\nin several diseases and it is emerging along with the quantitative approach to research on overweight and obese people.\nWhile the importance of steroid metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been reported,\nlimited data exists on the effective roles of AT in pregnant women suffering from PCOS. The aim of this study was to\ndetermine association of fatty acid (FA) profiles with expression of 14 steroid genes in abdominal subcutaneous AT of\nPCOS vs. non-PCOS pregnant women. In this case-control study, the AT samples of 36 non-PCOS pregnant women and 12 pregnant women with PCOS (3:1 ratio control: case) who underwent cesarean section were collected. Relationship of expressing gene targets and different features were performed using Pearson correlation analysis on the R 3.6.2 software.\nThe ggplot2 package in R tool was used to draw the plots. Age (31.4 and 31.5 years, P=0.99), body mass index (BMI) (prior pregnancy 26 and 26.5 kg.m-2,\nP=0.62) and at delivery day (30.1 and 31, P=0.94), gestational period (264 and 267 days, P=0.70) and parity\n(1.4 and 1.4, P=0.42) of non-PCOS and PCOS pregnant women were similar. Expression of steroidogenic acute\nregulator (STAR) and 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11BHSD2) in non-PCOS pregnant women showed\nthe highest association with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3, r=0.59, P=0.001) and (r=0.66, P=0.001),\nrespectively. In the all participants, STAR mRNA level showed the greatest association with the EPA fatty acid\nconcentration (P=0.001, r=0.51). Our results showed a link between the genes involved in steroid metabolism and fatty acids in AT of pregnant women, especially for omega-3 FA and the gene involved in the first step of steroidogenesis in subcutaneous AT.\nThese findings warrant further studies.",
    "body": "Introduction  Adipose tissue (AT)-also known as fat tissue or fatty\ntissue \u2013 is not only an energy storage organ, but also the\nlargest endocrine organ. It plays an important role in energy balance and reproductive function maintenance ( 1 ).\nIt has always been proposed that quantity and amount of\nAT, commonly referred as obesity and overweight, have\nsignificant impacts on many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers and most importantly infertility as\nwell as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a\ncommon endocrine and metabolic disease, occurring in\n4-18% of adolescent women and women of childbearing\nage ( 2 ). While some women with PCOS have normal\nweight, 50% of PCOS patients are suffering from obesity. Although PCOS is considered one of the leading\ncauses of infertility, many women suffering PCOS can\nget pregnant. So, understanding roles of AT in women\nwith PCOS and monitoring these patients throughout\npregnancy and their offspring development is highly relevant ( 3 ).  It has been hypothesized that AT plays crucial roles in\nsteroidogenesis and recent data showed that there is an\nassociation between fatty acid (FA) profiles and mRNA\nlevels of the genes involved in steroidogenesis ( 4 , 5 ).\nRelationship of AT with PCOS is driven by the pivotal\nrole played by the former on the metabolism of steroids,\nsuch as sex steroids, including aromatase cytochrome\nP450 (CYP19A1) and 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\n(17BHSD) family.  Additionally, the previous studies mentioned the important roles of mineralocorticoids,\nincluding steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) and glucocorticoids (11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase ( 11BHSD1 ) metabolism in AT. Profile of the steroids released\ninto circulation from AT are influenced by the adipocyte function and they can possibly\naffect distribution of AT, modulated by steroids. Hence, metabolic alteration of\nglucocorticoids has been reported to influence nature of the AT in women with PCOS ( 6 , 7 ).  Relationship of fat intake with AT (obesity and body\nweight) has been known for long time and recently, there\nis awareness of the different types of nutritional fat and\noil effects on body fat, metabolism and the related maladies. For example, fat sources, such as omega-3 fatty\nacids, have been shown to be beneficial to health, in\ncomparison with the other types of fatty acids. Studies\nshowed the beneficial effects of fish oil \u2013 a good source\nof omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 on metabolic profiles, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in PCOS patients ( 8 ). Thus, there is growing interest in the use of\nfish oil for treatment of women with PCOS. This interest\nhas been substantiated by the recent findings of reduction in levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) \u2013 fatty acids found\nin fish oil \u2013 in infertile women, compared to the controls\n( 9 ). In addition, a few interventional studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation on\nmetabolic profiles in patients with PCOS. In women suffering from PCOS, the earlier study showed that fattyacid based dietary supplements may be used for improving excessive ROS-caused ovarian disorder and insulin\nresistance ( 10 ). Despite these studies, the mechanisms\nby which specific fatty acids influence metabolic profiles have not been fully determined yet.  Studies prior to 1990 have not looked at association\nof fatty with expression of different genes and proteins\nin different body tissues, especially AT ( 11 ). These\nearly studies proposed that lipids only act through\naltering membrane phospholipid. However, in 1992,\nG\u00f6ttlicher et al. ( 12 ) pointed out the crucial roles of\nnuclear receptors, which alter glucocorticoid receptor\nand gene expression, in fatty acids metabolism. Importantly, activities of these transcription factors are\nregulated not only by hormones, but also by nutrients\nand metabolites ( 13 ) among which, fatty acids have\nfundamental roles.  As a scientific background, the previous studies, performed by Vara Prasad et al. ( 4 ) and Petrus et al. ( 5 ),\nshowed association of one or more limited types of\nfatty acids with a single gene (11-\u03b2-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type 1) in respectively rat and human.\nNovelty of the present study lies in two approaches \u2013\nstudy of the effects of fatty acids on all genes belonging to the steroidogenesis family and assessment of the\nrelationship between fatty acids and gene expression in\npregnant women suffering from PCOS. Little information exits about effects and fundamental mechanisms\nregarding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)\nfunction in women suffering from PCOS. Our objective\nwas to determine association between fatty acids and\nsteroidal gene expression in abdominal subcutaneous AT\nof pregnant women with and without PCOS.    Materials and Methods   Patients and AT samples collection  In this case-control study, after obtaining permission\nfrom the Royan Institute Ethics Committee (IR.ACECR.\nROYAN.REC.1398.087, Tehran, Iran), demographic data\nand AT samples were collected. Details of the sample collections, snap freezing and storage at -196\u2103 have been\npresented in the previous publication ( 14 ). This study\ninvolved 48 Iranian pregnant women who underwent\ncaesarean section including. Among the 48 women, 12\nwomen had PCOS and 36 did not have PCOS. According to 2003 Rotterdam criteria ( 2 ), the diagnostic traits of\nPCOS are the presence of two or more significant symptoms of the syndrome and patients that met two of three\nsymptoms were chosen as PCOS cases. PCOS diagnosis\nwas done by the medical practitioners affiliated to Royan\nInstitute.  Signed informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Samples were taken from the subcutaneous fat of\nabdomen of all women. During the time of sampling, the information about demographic data, life style conditions, drug medical intake, gestational diabetes mellitus\n(GDM), gestational hypertension (HPT) and metabolic\ndisorders were collected. We confirmed that all subjects\ndo not intake medical drugs affecting lipid metabolism\nand glucose, while they did not suffer from GDM and\nHPT (exclusion criteria). Maternal choice is the reason\nfor delivery by caesarean section (90%). Finally, case and\ncontrol groups were matched in terms of age and body\nmass index (BMI)-matched.    Fatty acid profiles analysis  At room temperature all samples were thawed. FA methyl esters were prepared with boron trifluoride (BF3) according to ISO 12966-2. A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu\nGC-2010 PLUS, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) with a\nflame ionization detector (FID) was used to separate FA\nmethyl esters. Separation was performed using a 100\nm\u00d70.25 mm, 0.2 \u03bcm column (Dikmacap 2330, Japan).\nHydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a column flow\nrate of 1.20 ml/minutes. The temperature of the column\nwas increased from 60\u00b0C to 240\u00b0C within 30 minutes.\nThe injector and detector temperatures were 250\u00b0C and\n280\u00b0C, respectively ( 14 ).    RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative\nreverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction procedures  Total RNA was extracted using the mini kit for RNeasy AT (Qiagen, Germany). A\nspectrophotometer (BioRad, Stanford, USA) was used for evaluation of the quality of the\nextracted RNA in terms of the A260/280 ratio. Then, for cDNA synthesis on RNA samples,\nPrime Script RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) was used and all experiments included negative\ncontrols (without cDNA) and RT controls. Gel electrophoresis were used for analysis of PCR\nproducts. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was\nperformed on the Step-One PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA), mRNA quantification was\nconducted and each reaction was run in duplicate. The NCBI primer Blast and Perl primer\nSoftware (version1.1.21) were used for primer design of all steroids target genes.\nUltimately, GAPDH as the housekeeping gene was used and messenger RNA\nexpression levels of all genes were analyzed by Qrt-pcr (2 \u2212\u0394\u0394ct ). We analyzed\nexpression level of 14 genes ( 7 ): steroidogenic acute regulator ( STAR ),\ncytochrome P450 monooxygenase ( CYP11A1 ), 17\u03b1-hydroxylase\n( CYP17A1 ), steroid 21-hydroxylase ( CYP21 ),\n11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 11BHSD1 and 11BHSD2 ),\naromatase cytochrome P450 ( CYP19A1 ), 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\n( 3BHSD1 and 3BHSD2 ) and 17 hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase family ( 17BHSD types 1, 3 , 5 , 7 and 12).    Statistical analysis  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for the normal\ndistribution test. t test and Mann-Whitney U test were\nused for the analyzed data with normal and abnormal\ndistribution, respectively. Relationships among the\nexpressions of gene targets and the different features\nwere analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis on\nthe R 3.6.2 software (University of Auckland, New\nZealand). The ggplot2 package in R tool was used to\ndraw the plots. The differences were considered significant at P\u22640.05.    Supplementary information  The manuscript contains supplementary material available\nat the enclosed files ( Figes.S1-S28 , See Supplementary\nOnline Information at www.ijfs.ir ). In the supplemented\nfigures, we showed correlation among different traits and\ndot plot of correlations between expression of gens and FA\nin women with and without PCOS. The ggplot2 package in\nR tool was used to draw the plots.

Relationship between fatty acids and gene expression  Results showed that C20-5n3 FA was the most associated factor with gene expression.\nExpression of STAR and 11BHSD1 genes in non-PCOS\npregnant women showed highest association with C20-5n3 FA (P=0.001, r=0.66 for STAR and P=0.001, r=0.59 for 11BHSD1 ). In the all\nparticipants, STAR gene expression had highest association with the\nC20-5n3 FA concentration (P=0.001, r=0.51).

Discussion  PCOS, which is one of the most common causes of unhealthy condition in women and\naccompanied by metabolic disorders, can be treated or reduced by changing lifestyle. It was\nsuggested that consumption of omega-3 is a typical recommendation for women suffering from\nPCOS ( 15 , 16 ). Our aim in this study was not to investigate potential pathways whereby fatty\nacids affect expression of steroid genes, but only to investigate relationship between fatty\nacids and expression of steroid genes. Our results showed that expression of STAR and 11BHSD2 genes have highest association with EPA\nin non-PCOS pregnant women (EPA, c20:5 n-3). It was surprising to find that in the initial\nstep of steroidogenesis and in all participants, STAR mRNA level had the\ngreatest association with the omega-3 FA concentration.  This is the first experiment, reposting association between the fatty acids in subcutaneous\nAT of pregnant women with PCOS and the expression of 14 steroid genes. There have been a few\nstudies investigated effects of this type of fat on gene expression. The first study\nconducted by Vara Prasad et al. ( 4 ) in 2010, showing that dietary FA composition altered 11bhsd type 1 gene expression in retroperitoneal rat white AT. The most\nrelevant study in this area, carried out by Petrus et al. ( 5 ). They compared relationship\nbetween saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with the expression of 11BHSD1 gene and 11BHSD1 protein in two areas of visceral and\nsubcutaneous women AT. Overall, they showed that there was a significant and strong\nrelationship between expression of the gene and the protein in visceral adipose tissue. They\nalso indicated that mono unsaturated FA (MUFA) fatty acids reduced expression of this gene,\nwhile saturated FA (SFA) in visceral AT increased expression of 11BHSD1 ;\nthe latter has Irrefutable role in cortisol metabolism. It seems that difference in\nexpression of this gene within two areas of AT may be due to differences in LMO3\ntranscription factor, and possible signals may be due to Toll-like receptors. This protein\ncomplex can act as a transcription regulator for genes in the pathways of the nervous\nsystem, and the endocrine system, both individually and in conjunction with other molecules\n( 17 ). Using animal and in vitro models, several studies demonstrated that\nsaturated fatty acids were potent activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome ( 18 ). On the other\nhand, it seems that unsaturated fatty acids, particularly animal omega-3 source such as fish\noil, inhibit the inflammasome ( 19 ).  There are two putative mechanisms to improve PCOS in women via omega-3 fatty acids: the\nfirst, relation of omega-3 fatty acids with inflammation and the second possible mechanism,\ndiminished effects of omega-3 on Testosterone levels in women with PCOS. On the basis of\nthis evidence, a study conducted by Calder ( 20 ) reported that PUFAs and their metabolites\nactivated PPARs to inhibit activity of NFK\u03b2 signals, while they were effective in reducing\ncytokines, inflammatory processes and homeostasis. This pointed role of PUFA in regulating\nsteroidogenesis and lipogeneses. EPA and DHA also provided substrates for synthesis of the\npro-inflammatory lipid mediator protectins, resolvins and decreased adipokines through\ninhibition of NFK\u03b2 signaling. Another study in the same field, confirmed the last\nstatements, indicating that CYP51 mRNA levels is up-regulated in granulosa\ncells by omega-3 in PCOS rat ( 21 ). Although in the current study, the goal was not to reach\npossible pathways whereby FA affects genes, but many studies have shown that fatty acids\neither activate or inhibit inflammatory pathways. Our previous study confirmed higher level\nof 11BHSD1 in women with PCOS and there was association between\ninflammatory and cortisol ( 7 ). In line with the current research, an interesting study\nproposed that supplementation of overweight/obese pregnant women, with dietary omega-3 fatty\nacids for more than 25 weeks, reduced inflammation in maternal adipose and the placental\ntissue ( 22 ).  Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) appears to be a central target of the anti-inflammatory effects\nat the cellular level. AT and placenta of the treated women exhibited significant decrease\nin TLR4 adipose and placental expression as well as IL6, IL8 and TNF\u03b1. In\nvitro , EPA and DHA suppressed activation of TLR4, IL6 and IL8 in cultures of\nadipocyte and trophoblast cells, induced by palmitate ( 22 ). In support of this study,\nanother study by Mansoori et al showed that DHA-rich fish oil supplementation for eight\nweeks increased CD36 expression in hypertriglyceridemia compared to\nnormotriglyceridemic subjects ( 23 ). It is typical that animal source of omega-3 FA (DHA and\nEPA) affect inflammation responses through down-regulation of the genes involved in\ninflammation process. Therefore, it is an expected response when fish oil supplements\nreduced expression of the adipose inflammatory genes ( IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 and circulating IL-18 levels) in AT ( 24 ).  On the other hand, studies performed by Forouhi et al. ( 25 ), Hajishafiee et al. ( 16 ) and\nNadjarzadeh et al. ( 26 ) determined effect of omega-3 on diminished testosterone levels in\nPCOS women, pointed out the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in PCOS. We focused on\npregnant women with PCOS and according to our findings and previous studies, omega-3 might\nassociate with hormonal changes by affecting steroid genes expression in AT. Additionally, a\nstudy performed in rat ovaries by Ma et al. ( 27 ) showed that unsaturated fatty acids ratio\nis important, apart from its concentration. These findings provided evidence that a balanced\nn-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is beneficial to improve fertility of women with PCOS. Ratio of n-3/n-6\nabout 1/15 in rat food altered expression of Cyp19, Star, 3bhsd and Cyp11 proteins, which\nmay indicate the importance of these fatty acids as a transcription factor for the above\ngenes. Similarly, a study showed that consumption of Linum usitatissimum oil for 21 days could regulate steroid genes ( Star and Cyp11 ) expression involved in initial steps of steroidogenesis as well as\ntestosterone metabolism ( 28 ). In this regard, our findings illustrated relationship of\nomega-3 FA with the gens involved in initial steps of steroidogenesis in AT.  Altogether, it seems that complications and dangers\nof PCOS are from activation of inflammatory pathways\nand high testosterone levels, while omega-3 fatty acids\naffect expression of the genes in AT of pregnant women\nby reducing inflammation and diminishing testosterone.\nWe need more investigation regarding mothers suffering\nfrom PCOS.  This study can hypothesize that type of fatty acids in\nAT is involved in activating inflammatory and activation\npathways or turning off many genes, including steroid\ngenes, and finally it can determine important association\nbetween fatty acids and gene expression in AT.    Conclusion  Fatty acids, directly or metabolically, can play a role\nin many diseases through extensive signaling pathways,\nspecifically in exacerbating PCOS, although pregnancy\ncan double the role of nutrition in exacerbating these\neffects. This is the first study in humans that has\ninvestigated association between FA types and gene\nexpression of steroids in AT of pregnant women with and\nwithout PCOS. We showed distinct relationships between\npolyunsaturated fatty acids with regard to the genes of\nfourteen steroids, especially for omega-3 fatty acids and\nthe genes involved in initial steps of steroidogenesis.
