The aim of this review is to evaluate the extent of evidence examining the physiological factors affecting energy homeostasis, which may impact weight gain, weight loss, and weight maintenance in PCOS, and identify research gaps and recommendations for future research. Literature searches using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, AMED, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted up to June 22, 2022. Abstracts, non\u2013English-language articles, and reviews were excluded. A total of n\u2009=\u200978 (n\u2009=\u200955 energy intake and n\u2009=\u200923 energy expenditure) primary research papers were included. Papers with multiple outcomes of interest were counted as separate studies. Energy-intake studies (n\u2009=\u200989) focussed on assessing food, nutrient, or supplements stimuli and were grouped into the outcomes of gastrointestinal appetite hormones (n\u2009=\u200943), adipokines (n\u2009=\u200934), subjective appetite (n\u2009=\u20099), functional brain imaging (n\u2009=\u20093), and neuropeptides (n\u2009=\u20090). Energy-expenditure studies (n\u2009=\u200929) were grouped into total energy expenditure (n\u2009=\u20091), resting energy expenditure (n\u2009=\u200915), meal-induced thermogenesis (n\u2009=\u20093), nutrient oxidation (n\u2009=\u20095), and metabolic flexibility (n\u2009=\u20095). Across both energy-intake and -expenditure papers, 60% of the studies compared outcome responses in women with PCOS with a control group. Results were inconsistent, with 57% reporting no differences and 43% reporting altered responses in PCOS compared with controls, including blunted appetite hormone responses, metabolic inflexibility, and reduced energy expenditure. The authors identified that there is inconsistent, yet preliminary, evidence of possible altered physiological factors, which may impact energy balance and weight management. Further work is needed to act on the identified clinical and research gaps to support women with PCOS and health professionals in informing and achieving realistic weight-management goals for women with PCOS. The protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework on February 16, 2021 (",
    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 8% to 13%. 1 PCOS is associated with reproductive (menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and infertility), metabolic (increased risk factors for and prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and psychological (anxiety and depression) features. 2 , 3 The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine or Rotterdam criteria are the most commonly accepted PCOS diagnostic criteria and recommended for use in the 2018 international evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCOS. 2 Diagnosis occurs when a woman has at least 2 of the following; oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism (either clinically or biochemically identified), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. 4 Intrinsic insulin resistance is a key pathophysiological feature of PCOS that occurs independently of excess weight. 5 This can lead to hyperinsulinemia, of which excess insulin can act on the ovaries and liver, contributing to hyperandrogenism. Weight gain and obesity are known to further worsen insulin resistance and the features of PCOS. 6 Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of excess weight and obesity compared with a healthy population of women 7 and greater longitudinal weight gain. 8  Weight management (prevention of excess weight gain, modest weight loss [\u223c5%], and maintenance of a reduced weight) through lifestyle (dietary, exercise, and behavioral) interventions is therefore a first-line management strategy according to the 2018 PCOS guidelines. 2 However, evidence of higher obesity rates, 7 longitudinal weight gain in community populations, 8 and high attrition rates in clinical dietary interventions 9 suggests that women with PCOS may experience challenges with lifestyle and weight management. Abnormalities in the physiological responses to energy intake and/or energy expenditure lead to a state of energy imbalance, whereby overall energy intake is greater than that expended, 10 thus perpetuating weight gain.  Women with PCOS exhibit abnormal pathophysiological mechanisms in energy homeostasis related to hormonal or metabolic abnormalities. 11 Appetite regulation is complex and controlled by processes, including gut hormones (eg, ghrelin) and neuropeptides (eg, neuropeptide Y [NPY]), which fluctuate throughout the short and long term related to factors including fat storage, blood glucose concentrations, and gastrointestinal tract sensation. 12 , 13  To help understand the regulation of energy intake it is important to understand the intrinsic physiological response to actual nutrient or food stimuli. Postprandial studies have reported impaired appetite regulation in women with PCOS, showing increased postprandial hunger (visual analogue scale) and blunted gastrointestinal appetite hormone responses, including ghrelin and cholecystokinin (CCK). 14 , 15 In contrast, there are studies reporting no postprandial differences in ghrelin response between women with and without PCOS. 16 , 17 Women with PCOS also have an impaired relationship between ghrelin and NPY, which is partially influenced by insulin resistance, 18 and reduced postprandial CCK associated with hyperandrogenism. 15 Appetitive brain responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to food pictures during a glucose challenge have been shown to be impaired in insulin-resistant women with PCOS, which may lead to increased non-homeostatic food consumption. 19 In addition, components of energy expenditure have been reported as being different in women with than in those without PCOS, including decreased meal-induced thermogenesis (MIT) 20 and resting metabolic rate 21 ; however, the evidence is not always consistent, with some studies showing no differences. 22 , 23  While there is evidence suggesting that impairments in mechanisms relating to energy homeostasis, including appetite regulation and energy expenditure, may contribute to difficulties with weight management in PCOS, the research to date is limited and inconsistent, with a lack of evidence synthesis. The aim of this scoping systematic review is to explore the current extent of evidence on the physiological factors affecting energy balance that may impact weight gain, weight loss, and weight maintenance in women with PCOS. This will help to identify physiological differences between women with and without PCOS and identify research gaps and highlight emerging areas that warrant further investigation and translation into clinical practice.    METHODS  This scoping review was conducted according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews) and the methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. 24   Eligibility criteria  Studies on women with PCOS that reported on physiological outcomes that affect energy homeostasis were included. Both intervention and observational studies and those with and without a comparator/control group were included. Outcomes included gastrointestinal hormones, neuropeptides, subjective measures of hunger and satiety, fMRI, resting metabolic rate, and nutrient oxidation measured by the reference method of indirect calorimetry and total energy expenditure (TEE) measured by the reference method of doubly labeled water. Briefly, doubly labeled water is a noninvasive technique based on the measurement of the dilution spaces and the elimination rates of the tracers (via spot urine collection) over a period of 7\u201314\u2009days after the ingestion of water labeled with 2 nonradioactive stable isotopes, deuterium and oxygen-18. The difference in elimination rates is proportional to carbon dioxide production and used to calculate TEE. 25 , 26 The comprehensive list of study outcomes is detailed in the Medline search strategy in Table\u2009S1 (see the Supporting Information online).  We acknowledge that the analytes involved in energy homeostasis (eg, novel adipokines, peptide hormones) are constantly evolving and that this list is not exhaustive; therefore, relevant analytes identified that were not on the list were documented. Studies that only measured and reported behavioral change outcomes (eg, dietary behavior, physical activity) and did not report on any biological outcomes that can influence weight management were excluded. Non-primary research, such as review articles, grey literature, conference abstracts, and case studies, as well as non\u2013English-language studies, were also excluded.    Literature search and study selection  The literature search was conducted to identify articles published up until June 22, 2022, on 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, AMED, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). The MEDLINE (Ovid) search strategy is provided in Table\u2009S1 (see the Supporting Information online). All identified studies were exported in EndNote X9.2 (Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA) and duplicates were removed, with remaining studies imported into Covidence ( www.covidence.org ). Each of the studies identified in the database searches were assessed for inclusion first by abstract and title by 2 independent investigators (K.N., Z.D., S.P., A.L.D., L.J.M.), with discrepancies resolved by a third investigator (L.J.M.). Each of the studies that met or appeared to meet the inclusion criteria were retrieved as full text (K.N., M.M., M.C.) and were assessed for eligibility by 2 independent investigators (K.N., L.J.M., Z.D., M.M.), with discrepancies resolved by consensus (K.N., L.J.M., Z.D., M.M.).    Data charting and synthesis of results  Data were extracted using custom Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft Corporation) that were developed and piloted by 2 investigators (K.N., L.J.M.) and that grouped the studies into the 2 broad categories of \u201cenergy homeostasis studies\u201d and \u201cnon-energy homeostasis studies\u201d and their outcomes of interest.   Energy homeostasis studies  Energy homeostasis studies were defined as studies focusing on energy intake or expenditure as per the criteria below.  Energy-intake studies were defined as studies that measured the study outcomes in response to food or nutrient intake or food cues (eg, postprandial studies, test meal studies, or dietary interventions). Outcomes were grouped into the categories below.    Gastrointestinal hormones and adipokines    Subjective appetite    fMRI    Neuropeptides    Energy-expenditure studies were defined as studies that measured energy-expenditure outcomes listed below using the reference methods of doubly labeled water and indirect calorimetry.    TEE    Resting energy expenditure (REE)    MIT    Nutrient oxidation    Metabolic flexibility    Study characteristics were extracted by 2 investigators (K.N., L.J.M.) and cross-checked by a third investigator (M.M.) and included author, year, relevant study aim in the context of this review, study design, sample size, age, body mass index (BMI), intervention, and outcomes. This information was further synthesized into another table to group the number of studies according to their broader category, outcome, intervening factor, and any comparisons with a control group (differences between groups were determined by what was reported within each paper by the authors) and cross-checked by a third investigator (M.M.). The intervening factors included oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT), acute meal tolerance test, diet/supplement intervention, visual food cues, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Papers measuring multiple outcomes were counted as independent studies. For example, a paper investigating ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) in response to an acute meal tolerance test was counted as 1 study for ghrelin and 1 study for PYY.    Non\u2013energy homeostasis studies  Studies that measured the study outcomes but not in the context of the defined energy homeostasis criteria above were grouped into non\u2013energy homeostasis studies. For these studies, only higher-level study characteristics were extracted (S.P., M.M., M.C., M.H.) (author, year, study design, and relevant study outcomes) and 10% were cross-checked (M.M.). These studies were grouped into 6 broad categories according to their primary and any secondary focuses (if identified) (cardiometabolic, fasting measures, receptors and gene expression, reproduction, medication and pharmaceuticals, and other).      RESULTS   Selection of sources of evidence  The database searches identified 8472 papers. Following removal of duplicates, 6756 papers underwent title and abstract screening and 681 underwent full-text screening. In total, 534 papers were retrieved for inclusion into the review comprising 78 energy homeostasis papers and 456 non\u2013energy homeostasis papers ( Fig.\u20091 ). Papers with multiple outcomes of interest were counted as separate studies.   Figure\u20091    Flow diagram of the literature search process.  Abbreviations : PICOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.

Energy intake    Gastrointestinal hormones   Gastrointestinal hormones were measured in 44 studies. The 2 most studied hormones were ghrelin (n\u2009=\u200915), with the majority (70%) measuring total ghrelin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (n\u2009=\u200911) followed by gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) (n\u2009=\u20098) and PYY (n\u2009=\u20095). Very few studies examined the hormones CCK (n\u2009=\u20093) and amylin (n\u2009=\u20091). With regard to the type of intervening factor, from the total number of studies (n\u2009=\u200944), 17 examined gastrointestinal hormone response to an OGTT, 17 to an acute meal tolerance test, and 10 to a diet/supplement intervention. Thirty-five out of the 44 studies compared the response with a non-PCOS control group following either an OGTT, acute meal tolerance test, or diet/supplement intervention. Sixteen studies showed no difference between PCOS and control groups, 15 studies showed less response in the PCOS group compared with the control group (potentially indicative of an impairment in gastrointestinal hormonal appetite regulation in PCOS), and 4 studies showed greater response in the PCOS group compared with the control group.     Adipokines   Leptin was measured in 16 studies. One study examined circulating leptin response to a glucose clamp, 27 3 studies examined response to an OGTT, 28\u201330 2 examined response to an acute meal tolerance test, 31 , 32 and 10 studies examined the response to a diet/supplement intervention. 14 , 33\u201341 Eight out of the 16 studies compared leptin response with a non-PCOS control group, with 6 showing no difference between PCOS and control, 14 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 38 , 39 1 study showing a decreased response in PCOS compared with the control, 27 and 1 study showing a greater response in PCOS compared with the control. 30 Adiponectin was studied in 18 studies. Four examined adiponectin response to an OGTT, 28 , 42\u201344 1 to an acute meal tolerance test, 31 and 13 to a diet/supplement intervention. 33\u201335 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 45\u201351 Six out of the 18 studies compared the response with a non-PCOS control group, with 4 showing no difference between PCOS and control, 31 , 39 , 42 , 51 1 showing a decreased response in PCOS compared with the control, 28 and 1 showing greater response in PCOS compared with the control. 43 Differences in the response between PCOS and control groups may indicate that the regulatory role of circulating adiponectin and leptin in energy homeostasis may be altered in women with PCOS.     Subjective appetite   Subjective appetite was measured in 4 studies in response to an acute meal tolerance test, 15 , 52\u201354 with 2 studies showing no differences in satiety in PCOS compared with controls 52 , 53 and 2 studies showing a difference including an earlier return of hunger in women with PCOS after a meal. 15 , 54 Five studies assessed the impact of a diet/supplement intervention on subjective satiety 14 , 55\u201358 ; 2 studies comprised a control group, which included the assessment of the impact of an energy-restricted diet on subjective satiety. 14 , 58 No differences in satiety between groups were seen after an 8-week intervention. 58 In contrast, after the 12-week intervention, women with PCOS were hungrier and less satiated than controls. 14     Functional magnetic resonance imaging   Corticolimbic blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) responses to visual food cues were measured in 3 studies. None of these compared BOLD responses with a control group; rather, they sought to assess the BOLD response in women with PCOS with and without insulin resistance. All 3 studies reported compromised corticolimbic BOLD responses to visual food cues with insulin resistance. 19 , 59 , 60     Neuropeptides   No papers were identified.     Energy expenditure    Total energy expenditure   Total energy expenditure measured using the reference method of doubly labeled water was conducted in only 1 study. 61 TEE was measured in a group of women with PCOS (no control) and reported that, to increase the precision of established equations for the estimation of energy requirements, accurate measures of physical activity are required.     Resting energy expenditure   Resting energy expenditure was measured in 15 studies. Twelve studies characterized REE, with 7 out of the 8 that compared REE in PCOS with controls showing no difference between groups 22 , 23 , 62\u201365 and 1 study showing reduced REE in women with PCOS. 21 Three studies assessed REE in response to a diet/supplement intervention, none compared with non-PCOS controls. 66\u201368     Meal-induced thermogenesis   Meal-induced thermogenesis was measured in 3 studies. Two studies assessed MIT in response to an acute meal tolerance test. 20 , 63 From the 2 that compared women with PCOS with a control group, 63 one showed no difference and one showed reduced MIT in PCOS. 20 One study assessed MIT in response to a diet/supplement intervention, and did not compare with a non-PCOS control. 68     Nutrient oxidation  Nutrient oxidation was measured in 5 studies. Three studies assessed nutrient oxidation in response to hyperinsulinemia euglycemic clamp. 69\u201371 From these 3 studies, 2 compared women with PCOS with a control group: 2 showed no difference 69 , 70 and 1 showed a reduced response in PCOS indicative of lower insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. 71 One study characterized nutrient oxidation in PCOS, with the PCOS group showing a greater response than controls as evidenced by a greater respiratory exchange ratio, potentially reflecting greater carbohydrate intake, 62 and 1 study assessed nutrient oxidation in response to a diet/supplement intervention. 68    Metabolic flexibility  Metabolic flexibility was measured in 5 studies using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. From the 4 studies that compared women with PCOS with a control group, 1 showed no difference 72 and 3 showed a reduced response in PCOS indicating impaired metabolic flexibility. 73\u201375     Non\u2013energy homeostasis papers  For non\u2013energy homeostasis papers, the numbers of papers (n\u2009=\u2009456) categorized into the following primary and secondary focus categories, respectively, were cardiometabolic (n\u2009=\u2009190, n\u2009=\u200926), receptors and gene expression (n\u2009=\u200985, n\u2009=\u20097), medication and pharmaceuticals (n\u2009=\u200989, n\u2009=\u20091), fasting measures (n\u2009=\u200959, n\u2009=\u200966), reproduction (n\u2009=\u200922, n\u2009=\u200923), and other (n\u2009=\u200911). From these, the numbers of papers with study outcomes from the primary and secondary focus categories, respectively, were adiponectin (n\u2009=\u2009236, n\u2009=\u200956), leptin (n\u2009=\u2009219, n\u2009=\u200956), ghrelin (n\u2009=\u200954, n\u2009=\u200913), nesfatin-1 (n\u2009=\u20099), and resistin (n\u2009=\u20097), and smaller numbers of papers for other outcomes (n\u2009=\u200921) ( see  Table\u2009S3 in the Supporting Information online).    Other analytes related to energy homeostasis  Analytes identified relating to energy homeostasis that were not in our list of outcomes were documented. These included adipsin, adropin, aprosin, kisspeptin, vaspin, spexin, chemerin, asprosin, ATF4, neudesin, obestatin, neuregulin 4, subfatin, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5), and l -carnitine.     DISCUSSION  To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review to synthesize research exploring physiological factors affecting energy balance in PCOS. It identified 534 papers, of which 15% (n\u2009=\u200978) were categorized as energy homeostasis (energy intake and expenditure). The remainder were categorized as non\u2013energy homeostasis as they examined outcomes outside the scope of energy homeostasis, highlighting their intricate physiological roles and interplay across other body systems, including fertility 76 and cardiometabolic health. 77   Energy intake  The gastrointestinal tract plays a fundamental role in energy homeostasis. Peptides released in response to nutrients, including the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin and appetite-inhibitory hormones GLP-1, PYY, and CCK, 78 are important regulators of appetite. 79 We identified 53 studies across the response of appetite hormones and appetite to nutrient intake. Blunted postprandial appetite hormone responses, including ghrelin, 53 , 80 GLP-1, 81 and CCK, 15 were observed in some studies, but not all 16 , 17 , 31 , 54 , 52 studies, for women with PCOS compared with controls. These altered responses may potentially disrupt satiety cues contributing to greater food intake. A previous systematic review (n\u2009=\u200920 studies) by Gao et al 82 reported lower fasting ghrelin in women with PCOS compared with controls. As the magnitude of postprandial responses are related to fasting concentrations, 83 , 84 findings from Gao et al 82 further support the potential for altered appetite regulation in PCOS. Moreover, reduced fasting ghrelin concentrations have been strongly associated with the degree of insulin resistance, 85 highlighting that further research and evidence synthesis should focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking blunted ghrelin and other appetite hormone concentrations to altered energy homeostasis.  There is also some, albeit inconsistent, evidence of differences in subjective appetite between women with and without PCOS. For instance, in response to acute meal studies, 2 studies showed differences in satiety, 15 , 54 while 2 studies showed no differences. 52 , 53 As food form (liquid vs solid) may affect postprandial appetite, 86 this discrepancy may be related to the meal, in that the former and latter studies were based on liquid and solid preloads, respectively. Insulin resistance may also impact appetite, with women with PCOS and insulin resistance having greater energy intake than those without insulin resistance. 54 Contrasting results were also seen in the 2 studies assessing the impact of an energy-restricted dietary intervention on satiety. 14 , 58 The discrepancy may relate to differences in the duration of the interventions (8\u2009weeks vs 12\u2009weeks). Future study designs should consider factors including standardization of preloads, intervention duration, and participant characteristics to reduce heterogeneity and increase the robustness of comparisons for appetite hormones and subjective appetite.  The brain releases neuropeptides such as the orexigenic NPY that play a crucial role in food-intake regulation by acting within the hypothalamus and other appetite-modulating centers in the brain. 87 Our review did not identify any studies examining neuropeptide response specifically to food or nutrient intake in women with PCOS. However, recent reviews on neuroendocrine regulation in PCOS, including in vitro and preclinical models, report possible impairments in PCOS. 18 , 88 Moreover, 1 small pilot study (n\u2009=\u20097) reported that women with PCOS have a blunted NPY response to ghrelin, with hyperinsulinemia potentially related to this impaired response. 89 Further studies are required to explore neuroendocrine mechanisms and their interactions with food intake and weight regulation in PCOS.  Leptin is a regulator of primarily long-term energy balance and functions to suppress food intake. 90 Adiponectin plays a role in the regulation of glucose concentrations, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. 91 Systematic reviews report elevated fasting leptin 92 and lower fasting adiponectin 93 in women with compared with those without PCOS. This occurred independently of adiposity 93 and in relation to insulin resistance 94 for adiponectin. These differences may have ramifications for altered appetite regulation. Our scoping review identified 16 and 18 studies for food- or nutrient-stimulated leptin and adiponectin, respectively, with the majority of these investigating dietary and/or supplement interventions. For studies with control groups, 3 studies 14 , 38 , 39 reported no effect of PCOS status on leptin and 2 studies 39 , 51 reported no effect of PCOS status on adiponectin following weight loss. Further research with these outcomes should include control groups to strengthen the study design.  The responses of neural activity to food cues, such as BOLD through fMRI, 95 are also important modulators of energy intake. A systematic review of 60 studies reported altered neural activity in overweight and obese individuals, which may potentiate the pathogenesis of overconsumption and weight gain. 96 We identified 3 fMRI studies measuring brain signals to food cues in women in PCOS. 19 , 59 , 60 While these studies reported compromised appetite brain responses to food pictures with women with insulin resistance in PCOS, they did not include a control group and findings should be interpreted with care. Future research should explore differences in response to food cues between women with and without PCOS and consider the additional impact of having overweight or obesity.    Energy expenditure  It has been hypothesized that decreased energy expenditure may play a role in energy imbalance in PCOS. Total energy expenditure can be divided into 3 main components: REE (\u223c60%\u201370% of TEE), MIT (\u223c10% of TEE 97 ), and activity-induced energy expenditure (\u223c30%\u201340% of TEE). 98 Only 1 study in our review assessing TEE in PCOS used doubly labeled water. 61 As a gold-standard reference method, further research needs to include this measure 25 ; however, its cost (\u223c1000 Australian dollars/person 99 ) is a common barrier precluding its use. 100 Fifteen studies measured REE in women with PCOS, with 7 out of the 8 studies with a control group showing no differences in women with and without PCOS. 20 , 22 , 23 , 62\u201365 Future research should consider the contribution of body composition to energy expenditure, given that women with PCOS may have a greater percentage of fat mass 101 as a potential predisposing factor to weight gain given its lower contribution to REE (5%\u20137%) compared with fat-free mass (\u223c60%\u201370%). 102 Brown adipose tissue contributes to energy balance through heat dissipation. This may be an additional mechanism contributing to energy homeostasis impairments in PCOS as it is lower in women with PCOS compared with controls. 103 Finally, of the limited studies assessing MIT in PCOS, 1 study, 20 but not the other, 63 showed reduced MIT compared with controls, particularly in those with insulin resistance. This, again, indicates that insulin resistance may be a possible contributing factor to impaired energy homeostasis in PCOS.  Metabolic inflexibility refers to the impaired metabolic capacity to switch from lipid oxidation in fasting conditions to lipid availability in nonfasting conditions. This can lead to lipid accumulation in ectopic tissues, such as skeletal and other peripheral tissues. 104 Three of the 4 papers in our review demonstrated metabolic inflexibility in women with PCOS compared with controls 73\u201375 and hyperandrogenemic women had lower glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility than non-hyperandrogenemic women. 74 A prior systematic review similarly reported greater metabolic inflexibility in women with PCOS compared with controls, associated with insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia, and similar to obesity and type 2 diabetes cohorts. 105 As metabolic flexibility improves with lifestyle changes in insulin-resistant individuals with overweight and obesity, 106 , 107 the effect of lifestyle management on metabolic flexibility in PCOS is thus an important area for future investigation.    Strengths and limitations  Strengths of this review include being conducted according to the PRISMA-ScR and methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. 24 A further strength is that we only included papers with higher-quality measures of energy intake (response to nutrient/food stimulation) and energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water) to more accurately capture physiological regulation of energy homeostasis. Limitations include the lack of a risk-of-bias assessment, as we conducted a broad and comprehensive scoping review to map the extent of the existing literature. Limitations of the literature included small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and lack of clarity on which outcomes studies were powered on. As a result, the findings of individual studies should be interpreted with caution and not without further interrogation. Furthermore, only n\u2009=\u20095 (6%) studies were conducted with adolescents. Further work is warranted in this population as the higher weight gain observed in PCOS can occur across childhood and adolescence and early lifestyle management is crucial. 108 Finally, although psychological factors were beyond the scope of this review, they may also be contributors to weight-management challenges, given that depression is an independent predictor of attrition in weight-loss interventions and women with PCOS who are overweight or obese have higher levels of depressive symptoms. 109 The relative contribution of psychological and physiological factors to weight-management challenges in women with PCOS could be further explored.    Future research priorities  Several future research priorities have been identified, including the need for primary studies investigating the impact of energy intake on specific outcomes (eg, novel adipokines, gastrointestinal appetite hormones, fMRI, MIT, metabolic flexibility, and neuropeptides). These primary studies should comprise a control group, where possible, to help elucidate the direct effect of PCOS on outcomes. Future research is also needed to characterize TEE in women with PCOS, as well as to consider the influence of PCOS phenotype and pathophysiological features such as hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia on energy homeostasis. Attention should also be given to the examination of PCOS in adolescent populations, where research is currently lacking.     CONCLUSION  This scoping review has systematically synthesized and mapped the literature on physiological factors relating to energy balance in women with PCOS. Over half of the existing studies compared responses between women with and without PCOS with varying degrees of heterogeneity in responses within each energy homeostasis category. Although detailed synthesis of the individual study results is beyond the scope of this review, we provide preliminary, but inconsistent, evidence of possible altered intrinsic physiological factors that may impact weight management in PCOS. Several priorities for future research have been identified, which will provide a clearer understanding on the potential physiological factors that may impact energy homeostasis. Addressing these gaps in women with PCOS will contribute significantly to understanding the etiology of weight gain and obesity and assist with informing future research and interventions consistent with international evidence-based guidelines for PCOS. Clinically, it should be acknowledged that women with PCOS likely face altered physiological factors, which may impact energy balance, although the specific mechanisms require further investigation.
