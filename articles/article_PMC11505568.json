    "abstract": "Introduction Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disorder affecting millions of women worldwide, often leading to significant physiological and psychological challenges among medical students because of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among female medical students at Taif University in Saudi Arabia in January 2024 using an online questionnaire distributed via a Google form. Results Out of 243 participants, 23 students (9.5%) were diagnosed with PCOS. One hundred and fifty-six (64.9%) of females experienced skin symptoms, including acne and oily skin, mostly during exam periods. More than half (n=131, 54.4%) had generalized anxiety, and 42 students (17.4%) reported delays in the menstrual cycle. Significant associations were found between being diagnosed with PCOS and experiencing generalized anxiety\u00a0(p=0.020), irregular menstrual cycles (p=0.004), having diabetes (p=0.006), family history of PCOS (p=0.001), and being aware of PCOS and lifestyle relation (p=0.022). Conclusion The study findings showed that Taif University medical students do not exhibit a noticeably increased prevalence of PCOS. Still, most students are at risk of developing PCOS due to the\u00a0positive family history of PCOS and\u00a0excessive generalized anxiety and females with irregularity in the menstrual cycle and those who have diabetes.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disease that affects nearly 116 million women worldwide. In 2021, the World Health Organization found women of reproductive age with PCOS experience compromised academic and professional success because of the effects of PCOS [ 1 ]. According to studies conducted in the United States, they found the prevalence of PCOS ranges from 5 to 7% [ 2 ]. The result of a survey among health sciences students in South India to know the proportion and determinants of PCOS showed that 8.1% of participants had a PCOS diagnosis. Of the remainder, 90.9% had a low risk of PCOS, and 9.1% had a high risk [ 3 ].  Moreover, in Oman, women with PCOS had a prevalence of 2.8% in hospital-based studies in 2010 [ 4 ]. Based on Rotterdam criteria to measure the prevalence of PCOS, they found that 14.1% of Iranian females have PCOS [ 5 ]. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of PCOS was revealed to be 32.5%, according to a study carried out among 719 women living in Madinah city [ 6 ]. Additionally, according to an online survey conducted at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University in Saudi Arabia, 16% of women suffer from PCOS [ 7 ].  Furthermore, PCOS is a multifarious syndrome characterized by multiple features: menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian development [ 8 ]. There are several diagnostic criteria for PCOS; for example, in 2006, the Androgen Excess Society (AES) relied on the hyperandrogenism symptom as the main diagnosis for PCOS. Currently, the modified Rotterdam criteria is the most followed one, which diagnoses PCOS based on the existence of at least two of the following features: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovarian morphology using ultrasound, hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, and hair loss), and exclusion of any other clinical condition [ 9 ]. In addition to its effects on reproduction, PCOS is associated with several metabolic and psychiatric comorbidities that significantly impair the health of those who are affected [ 10 ].  Furthermore, medical students are faced with an extremely rigorous curriculum that could lead to stress with a sedentary lifestyle and altered dietary patterns might potentially raise the risk of developing PCOS. Nonetheless, studies focused on women with PCOS showed that medical school students with PCOS faced both the physiological and psychological effects of the disorder while studying [ 11 - 12 ].  Worldwide, PCOS significantly reduces women's quality of life [ 13 ]. It may be considered a risk factor for developing cancer [ 14 ]. Therefore, this study aimed to raise medical students' awareness of the relationship between their lifestyle and PCOS. In addition, will share recommendations based on the results to enhance health quality in Saudi Arabia.    Materials and methods  Study design and settings  This is a cross-sectional study conducted from 15 January to 29 January 2024 at Taif University to investigate the prevalence of symptomatic\u00a0PCOS among female medical students and its association with lifestyle behaviors.  Study population  Data was collected from 243 female medical students in the 1st to 6th year at Taif University from 15 to 29 January 2024 who were willing to participate. The sample size among 658 female medical students at Taif University was calculated using an online Raosoft sample size calculator ( www.raosoft.com ).  Data collection method and tool  Data was collected using an online questionnaire (Appendix 1) distributed through an online Google form. The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: consent to participate and included the academic year, diagnosis of PCOS, skin symptoms, and lifestyle characteristics, including tension, anxiety, menstrual cycle regularity, diabetes status, awareness of the relationship between lifestyle and PCOS, dietary habits, and exercise frequency. The online questionnaire\u00a0uses a pilot test. The pilot study was conducted on six individuals to ascertain the tool's feasibility, applicability, and clarity. However, five people were excluded from the final analysis of the pilot study.  Ethical consideration  The survey was restricted to one response only using the participants' email, and personal information was kept undeclared to maintain accuracy and confidentiality. All participants signed a written form including all females studying in medical college at Taif University. The ethical approval was obtained from the Taif University Ethics Committee No. HAO-02-T-105 on 22 January 2024 (approval number 45-138).  Statistical analysis  Data collected was entered into an Excel sheet for data validation and was introduced to the Statistical Package of Social Sciences Software Program (SPSS), version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) for statistical analysis. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages. The Chi-square was used to assess the association between medical students' lifestyle characteristics (independent variables) and the prevalence of PCOS (dependent variable). A test was considered significant if the p-value was lower than 0.05.    Results  The study included 243 female medical students, most of whom were from the first three years of university. The highest representation was in the third year, n=54 (22.2%), followed by the second year, n=52 (21.4%), then the first year, 51 (21%), as shown in Figure 1 .   Figure 1   Academic year of included participants     Table 1 shows the prevalence of PCOS and associated skin symptoms. Only 23 students (9.5%) were diagnosed with PCOS. Regarding skin symptoms, 156 students (64.9%) suffered from acne and oily skin, whereas 104 (43.0%) experienced an increase in skin symptoms during exam periods and 52 (21.5%) experienced them during the semesters. Additionally, 36 students (14.9%) experienced a blackish mark around their neck.   Table 1   Prevalence of PCOS and skin symptoms  PCOS:\u00a0Polycystic ovary syndrome.

We can also call it hyperandrogenic anovulation (HA); another name is Stein-Leventhal syndrome [ 15 ]. In our study, we aimed to provide insight into the prevalence of medical students with PCOS and to study the relationship between medical students' lifestyles and the increased prevalence of PCOS.  Our findings revealed that 23 (9.5%) out of 243 medical students at Taif University had been diagnosed with PCOS, and 156 (64.9%)of students reported suffering from acne and oily skin. Most symptoms increased during exams. In a study conducted at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), researchers discovered that out of 40 women with acne, 11 (27.5%) were diagnosed with PCOS, eight (20%) exhibited PCOS features on ultrasound, and 10 women had an elevated LH to FSH ratio [ 16 ]. Furthermore, 36 students (14.9%) in our study suffer from blackish marks on the neck. In addition, medical female students experience generalized anxiety.  On the other hand, our study demonstrated that menstrual irregularity is one of the important risk factors for PCOS; however, most female students have regular menstrual cycles. According to the most recent recommendations, irregular menstrual periods can be used as a diagnostic marker of ovulatory dysfunction. Oligo-amenorrhea (cycles > 35 days apart or <8 cycles per year) is the most common type of menstrual dysfunction [ 17 ]. Considering obesity is one of the risk factors, most of the participants have normal BMI, but 41 (17%) participants were overweight and 20 (8.3%) were obese. For clarification, Basu et al. considered the various mechanisms that could be responsible for the relationship between increased adiposity and PCOS [ 18 ]. Increased adiposity played an important mechanism in the development of PCOS and significantly affected the severity of clinical and endocrine features in many women with the condition. The authors found that female patients with PCOS have higher \u03b1-amylase, which is secreted in stressful situations, than other people, and it is significantly associated with BMI [ 18 ]. Moreover, we investigated whether there is a relationship between medical students who are at risk or who have already been diagnosed with PCOS and their family history as a risk factor. We found that 28 (11.6%) answered they had a family history. Although there are no previous studies that support this finding, we still need to consider the possibility that a female medical student who has been diagnosed with PCOS or is at risk may have a family history of the syndrome.  In addition, out of the 23 students who were diagnosed with PCOS, eight (3.3%) have diabetes mellitus. In a previous study in\u00a0Sahlgrenska University Hospital for infertility or hirsutism that compared the development of type 2 diabetes among females with PCOS and another control group without PCOS, researchers tracked a group of women with PCOS from around age 30 to over 50. The findings revealed women with PCOS were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those without PCOS (n=5 (19%) versus n=1 (1%) in the control group). Notably, all the women who developed type 2 diabetes were significantly overweight, and fat distribution was mainly around the waist [ 19 ]. These findings underscore the significance of early PCOS diagnosis. Additionally, women diagnosed with PCOS should receive guidance on weight management to mitigate the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, healthcare professionals should closely track weight and waist measurements in all women with PCOS to assess their susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the future.  Interestingly, our results showed a significant connection between the lifestyle behavior of medical students and PCOS. Our findings found that students who adhered to a healthy diet exhibited a higher incidence of PCOS compared to those with unhealthy or diverse eating patterns. However, students who exercised more than once a week showed a lower incidence of PCOS than those who did not participate in physical activity. Conversely, in a prior study that used an observational cross-sectional and case-control design, researchers investigated the relationship between physical activity and dietary patterns among adolescents with PCOS compared to healthy control girls. The study revealed notable differences in lifestyle between girls with PCOS and their age-matched control group. Specifically, Girls with PCOS consumed substantially more fat food than those in the control group, they also exhibited lower physical activity levels almost always. Interestingly, moderate to high physical activity significantly reduced the likelihood of PCOS [ 20 ].  These findings showed that the prevalence of PCOS is not significantly high, but\u00a0most of students are at risk of developing PCOS\u00a0due to the kind of lifestyle they had. Therefore, we recommended working to increase their awareness and improving good habits, such as exercising and eating healthy food is crucial. As well diabetic students should take care of hemoglobin (Hb)A1c, make a more nutritious food plan, regularly take their pills and insulin, and understand how to take the right dose. We suggested raising awareness among medical students using social media posters, university counseling advice programs, encouraging physical activity and dietary changes, and helping the campus community organize screenings.  Limitations  Despite the valuable insights and guidance, the study provided for gynecologists and other physicians, there are some limitations. The study\u00a0cross-sectional nature exposed it to selection and recall biases. It was also single-centered, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the treatment factor was not considered, constituting a potential variable.    Conclusions  The study findings showed that Taif University medical students do not exhibit a noticeably increased prevalence of PCOS as most were of normal weight, non-diabetic, and had regular menstrual cycles. However, most students are at risk of developing PCOS due to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, and anxiety, females\u00a0with a positive family history of PCOS, females with irregularity in the menstrual cycle, and those who have diabetes. Thus, increasing awareness among medical students by promoting physical activity and changing eating habits, providing counseling programs at the university, using social media posters, and supporting the university community in running screenings are crucial. Further research and interventions are warranted to enhance the health and well-being of individuals affected by PCOS in Saudi Arabia.",
