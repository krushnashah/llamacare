A diagnosis of\npolycystic ovary syndrome is associated with reproductive challenges including a\ndifficulty in conceiving as well as the pregnancy-related complications of\nmiscarriage, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and prematurity.\nConsequently, polycystic ovary syndrome has profound implications for women and\ntheir offspring with regard to reproductive function in the short term and in\nthe longer term the risk of chronic illness and congenital anomalies, and health\ncare resources should be directed accordingly to mitigate against these\nrisks.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5%\u201320% of women of reproductive age\nworldwide and is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and\npolycystic ovarian morphology. 1 The 2003 Rotterdam criteria are currently the internationally accepted\ncriteria by which PCOS is diagnosed. Patients are diagnosed with PCOS when two out\nof three criteria are satisfied: oligoovulation or anovulation, clinical and/or\nbiochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and/or the presence of polycystic ovaries\n(PCO) and exclusion of other etiologies (congenital adrenal hyperplasia and\nandrogen-secreting tumors). 2 There also exists the Androgen Excess and PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society definition\nwhich recommends that clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism should be essential\nfor diagnosis, but also ovulatory dysfunction is required in the form of either\noligo-anovulation or PCO. 3  The pathophysiology of PCOS is multifactorial, and it is believed that a genetic\npredisposition exists that is exacerbated by excess adiposity. It is thought that\nthe pathophysiology of PCOS involves the interaction between abnormal ovarian\nmorphology, due to excess androgen production by the PCO\u2014hyperinsulinemia, and\nelevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. 4 It has been shown that ovarian androgen production in women with PCOS is\naccelerated due to the increased ovarian theca cell androgenic enzymatic activity of\n3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/C17, 20 lyase, a product of CYP17. 5 Women affected by PCOS can present with a spectrum of signs and symptoms,\nranging from having minimal to major systemic manifestations of hyperandrogenemia\nand may have profound implications for a woman with regard to her reproductive\nhealth and the long-term health outcomes of her offspring. 6 The aim of this critical review is to highlight these potential implications\nand suggested interventions to reduce their impact.    Reproductive features in women with PCOS  Adolescents with PCOS often have earlier menarche, particularly if they are obese. 7 Precocious puberty, early adrenarche presenting with early pubic hair\ndevelopment or oligomenorrhoea may also be presenting symptoms. 8   \u2013 12 With regard to the potential\netiology of PCOS, it is thought that exposure to excess androgens in early fetal\nlife may increase the likelihood of developing PCOS in later years. 13  Various clinical and phenotypic presentations may precede the diagnosis of PCOS and\ninclude, but are not limited to, hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity,\nolio/anovulation and infertility. 7 In total, 80% of women affected by anovulatory infertility have PCOS, which\nis further adversely affected by excess weight. 14 Furthermore, women with anovulatory infertility have a longer interval until\npregnancy, hence are more likely to require fertility investigations and treatment\n( Figure 1 ). 14 , 15 Interestingly,\nin one observational study, women with PCOS are also more likely to have had their\nfirst pregnancy at a younger age and gave birth at least once; however, the total\nnumber of pregnancies in their lifetime tends to be lower than women without PCOS. 14 Women diagnosed with PCOS have a lower natural conception rate, an increased\nrate of biochemical pregnancy and a reduced response to artificial reproductive\ntechnology (ART). 7 , 16   Figure 1.

In one study, rates of EPL were no different between women with and without PCOS;\nhowever, the control group were comparatively older with lower ovarian reserve. 16 A meta-analysis has reported a five times increased risk of EPL and reported\na significant improvement of EPL in patients treated with metformin. It has been\nshown that treatment with the insulin sensitizer metformin, a synthetically derived\nbiguanide, which leads to a reduction in serum insulin concentrations, may improve\nthe features of PCOS. After IVF miscarriage, rates of 35.8% have been reported in\nwomen with PCOS in comparison to rates of 23.6% in women without PCOS; however,\nraised BMI, increased waist hip ratio and insulin resistance are also likely to play\na part.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), PCOS is the commonest cause of\nanovulatory infertility. 20 For some women with PCOS undergoing IVF or in vitro maturation (IVM),\nincreasing quantities of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are required to\nstimulate ovulation, particularly in those women who are obese. 15 Due to the polycystic nature of the ovaries in women with PCOS, they are at\nmoderate risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 16 Reported OHSS rates in the literature for women with PCOS who conceive after\nIVF are up to 7.5% compared to women without PCOS being in the order of 2.7%. 21 Despite the increased oocytes retrieved during an IVF cycle, the oocytes are\noften of a poorer quality, and these cycles are characterized by lower fertilization\nrates and a higher incidence of embryo transfer cancellations due to failed\nfertilization or OHSS. 15    Pregnancy complications  Several studies have consistently reported an increase in maternal complications for\nwomen with PCOS. There appears to be a trebling of the risk of maternal\ncomplications in women with PCOS when compared to healthy controls. 22 However, this may be influenced by the fact that many women with PCOS have a\ngreater chance of presenting in pregnancy with pre-existing medical issues. 6 This is believed to be due to the hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia\ncommonly seen in women with PCOS. This is further exacerbated by obesity, the\ngreater recourse to ART, and potentially, the greater risk of multiple pregnancies\nderived from recourse to ART in women with PCOS. 7  The extent of the increase in incidence of gestational diabetes (GDM),\npregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preeclampsia (PET) and cesarean section (CS)\ndiffers slightly among studies, but are reproducibly increased even when data are\nadjusted for BMI. In one study, a twofold to threefold increase in GDM was seen, 7 and PIH/PET were increased threefold to fourfold in women with\nPCOS, 23 \u2013 25 which corresponds to a 50%\nincrease in PET. 7 The need to perform an operative vaginal delivery, elective and non-elective\nCS was doubled, 22 and this is likely to have been impacted by the increase in maternal obesity\nand fetal macrosomia seen in women with GDM and multiple pregnancies derived from\nART. Increased gestational weight gain has also been evident in women with PCOS, 7 as well as a five times increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes seen in women\nwith PCOS and oligo-anovulation. 7 A prolonged time to pregnancy is a known risk factor for obstetric\ncomplications and adverse perinatal outcomes and is often seen in women with PCOS. 7 All of these factors make it essential that any treating doctor should\nendeavor to ensure that a woman with PCOS is as healthy as possible prior to\nconception and that if ART is required safe and appropriate intervention is\nperformed to ensure she conceives a singleton pregnancy.  GDM rates are higher for women with PCOS and a greater number of these women are\ndiagnosed in the first trimester, and this was thought to be due to insufficient\npancreatic \u03b2-cell function to overcome the placental hormone-mediated exacerbation\nof pre-existing insulin resistance. 16 , 26 Insulin resistance is also\nthought to have a direct effect on vascular function and is, therefore, implicated\nin the increased pregnancy complications seen in women with PCOS. 7 In one study, no differences were found in the preconception period between\nwomen with PCOS diagnosed with GDM compared to women without GDM in respect to\nmaternal age, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of\ninsulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)\nor testosterone; 26 however, patients with GDM had higher BMI and lower homeostasis model\nassessment of \u03b2-cell function (HOMA-\u03b2). Obese pregnant women with PCOS demonstrated\na high incidence of GDM with severe insulin resistance, including high fasting\ninsulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 at preconception compared with normal-weight patients. 26 As such, measuring \u03b2-cell function, such as HOMA-\u03b2, at preconception may\npredict the risk of GDM in pregnant PCOS patients, and a reduction of BMI in the\npreconception period may reduce the chance of developing GDM. In Sterling et al., 16 the risk of being diagnosed with GDM in pregnant women with PCOS was 15.5%\ncompared to 5% in the control group. The risk of developing GDM was not\nsignificantly increased in lean women with PCOS.  PIH and PET are both increased in women with PCOS, despite adjusting for BMI and ART. 27 It is hypothesized that hypertensive disorders in pregnant women with PCOS\nare influenced by elevated serum androgen levels in the mother. 28 Testosterone is thought to act on trophoblast invasion and therefore impacts\non placental morphology and function. 29 \u2013 31 Pregnancy appears to enhance\nthe low-grade inflammation typically seen in women with PCOS and is associated with\nhigher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels, free radicals and\ninflammatory markers. 32 These act to induce endothelial dysfunction, which alters remodeling of\nspiral arteries, which results in reduction of uterine artery impedance, reduced\ndepth of endovascular trophoblast and abnormal placentation. 29 , 33  Interestingly, placental signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (P-STAT3)\nsignaling are increased in placentas of women with PCOS, whereas mechanistic target\nof rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is unchanged. 34 P-STAT3 and mTOR are responsible for the regulation of placenta nutrient\ntransport and fetal growth, and alterations in STAT3 levels are seen in pregnant\nwomen with PCOS even in the absence of obstetric and perinatal complications. Higher\nlevels of STAT3 have been reported in women with hyperandrogenism, anovulation and\nPCO compared with women who have anovulation and PCO only. Although circulating\nlevels of androstenedione, androst-5-ene-3\u03b2, 17\u03b2-diol, testosterone and\n5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone were higher and estradiol lower in women with PCOS compared\nto controls; no correlation between STAT3 and sex steroid levels were found. 34 Leptin, often increased in the presence of PCOS, increases levels of STAT3 by\nbinding to its receptor. 35  Increased P-STAT3 may represent a pro-inflammatory state and may be involved in\nupregulation of key amino acid transporters that influence fetal growth. 36 Increased levels of STAT3 are seen in women with PCOS without\npregnancy-related pathology despite reductions in placenta thickness, density and volume. 30 These placenta features are consistent with changes associated with vascular\nlesions, chronic cillitis and intervillositis and abnormal villus maturity. They are\nmore common in women with features of hyperandrogenism, anovulation and PCO 31 and may result due to increased levels of circulating cytokines. 34  Rates of preterm delivery (PTD) in women with PCOS are increased, particularly for\nthose with hyperandrogemia. 7 Doherty et al. 6 reported rates of 21.1% compared to 12.5% in the control group ( Table 1 ). 7 The risk of stillbirth is elevated with rates reported in the order of 3.3%\nversus 1.6% in control groups. 14 Elevated stillbirth rates are influenced by the effects of increased maternal\npregnancy risk factors in women with PCOS and prematurity. 6 In an older study, using a control group with a low ovarian reserve, Sterling\net al. 16 demonstrated adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS who conceived via\nIVF, compared to those women who conceived with IVF who did not have PCOS. Their\nfindings were consistent with those published in the literature. GDM and\nhypertensive disorders in pregnancy were both increased. They also found an increase\nin antepartum hemorrhage (APH), cervical cerclage placement, preterm premature\nrupture of membranes (PPROMs) and fetal death in utero (FDIU). 16 These findings were consistent with those of Wax 37 who also recorded increased rates of cesarean wound complications.

All outcomes adjusted for IVF, Ethnicity (Caucasian, Indigenous, Asian\nand Other), multiple pregnancy, maternal age (<20, 20\u201329, 30\u201339,\n40+), parity (0, 1\u20134, 5+), time epoch (years <1990, 1990\u20131999,\n2000\u20132011), smoking during pregnancy (yes, no or unreported), maternal\nhypertension, pre-existing and gestational diabetes and\npreeclampsia.

Preconception counseling and psychological support  As PCOS commonly affects women of reproductive age, appropriate preconception\ncounseling and advice regarding the impact of lifestyle, obesity and age on\nfertility should be offered. 7 Emphasis should be focused on the impact that weight has on the clinical\npresentation and outcomes for women affected by the metabolic, psychological and\nreproductive repercussions of PCOS. Women with PCOS have a lower uptake of\ncontraception, which is thought to be due to perceived lower pregnancy rates. 19 Women with PCOS should be counseled regarding the appropriate use of\ncontraception to avoid unplanned pregnancy as the pregnancy rates for women with\nPCOS are similar to those women without PCOS. 19 For those women with PCOS, counseling should be provided that conception may\ntake longer to achieve, hence delaying childbearing may have an accumulative\nnegative impact on conception when age and BMI are factored in Joham et al. 19    Interventions to reduce the impact of PCOS on pregnancy outcomes  Given the significant increase in GDM and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy,\nperforming a first trimester oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and commencing\nlow-dose aspirin may mitigate the potential for poor placentation often seen in\nwomen with PCOS. 16 Smoking cessation should be routinely advised and high-dose folate may be of\nbenefit due to the increased risk of congenital anomalies seen in women with PCOS,\nparticularly those that are obese ( Table 2 ).

All anomalies for offspring are shown and subset of anomalies among\noffspring who reached the limit of ascertainment (6\u2009years of age and\nover or death), with data shown as n (%) and percentage accurate to\nthree decimals for greater accuracy when indicating rates per 1000\nbirths. p-values shown were generated using univariate chi-square test\nfor the univariate comparisons between the groups.     Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise should be addressed to optimize BMI, both\nfor a healthier pregnancy and to reduce exacerbation of PCOS. For those of normal\nBMI, regular self-monitoring and early action on small increments of weight gain as\nwell as prevention of further weight gain appears to be a feasible approach and more\nsuccessful than weight loss in women with established obesity. 7 Weight reduction of 5%\u201310% is recommended and has shown to improve ovulation\nand subsequent conception and reduces metabolic complications. 7 The behavioral lifestyle change that has demonstrated efficacy is the use of\nface-to-face-tailored dietary advice, an energy reduced diet and 150\u2009min of exercise\nper week. Exercising five times per week for 30\u2009min at a time, three of which are\nrecommended to be aerobic in nature, has been shown to improve clinical outcomes\nincluding insulin resistance even when weight is not lost. 15 When executed together, exercise and dietary intervention have been shown to\nimprove clinical outcomes compared to diet alone. 7  For women with a BMI over 30, who are anovulatory, bariatric surgery can assist with\nweight loss and improve PCOS markers; however, babies subsequently conceived are at\nrisk of growth restriction, and as such are best managed in a multidisciplinary care setting. 15 Weight stabilization should be achieved for 6\u201312\u2009months prior to attempting conception. 38  Depression and anxiety are more common in women with PCOS and is often more\nsevere. 14 , 39 , 40 The prevalence of depression in women with PCOS varies between\n28% and 64% 41 and anxiety rates vary from 34% to 57%. 42 Psychological disturbances are seen in women regardless of the severity or\ntype of PCOS phenotype exhibited 43 and negatively affects quality of life. 43 , 44 This demonstrates that in\naddition to hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, infertility and obesity women\nwith PCOS have higher rates of anxiety, depression, social phobia, eating disorders\nand suicide attempts. 45 Psychological intervention is an important part of the holistic care approach\nto women with PCOS and can assist with adapting to stressors encountered at\ndiagnosis, fertility treatment, pregnancy and beyond. Reduction in stress can also\nminimize its negative impact on the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian axis.    Perinatal and childhood outcomes  The perinatal outcomes of infants born to women with PCOS is significantly worse than\nthose born to women without PCOS, and this can be further exacerbated by maternal\ndiabetes, obesity, IVF and medication use. 7 The increase in poor perinatal outcomes can be accounted for by earlier\ngestational age at birth as well as PTD; however, the pathophysiology of these\noutcomes potentially originates much earlier on. It is possible that poor oocyte,\nembryo quality and the in utero environment can account for some of the adverse\nneonatal outcomes found. 7 Fetal macrosomia can result due to GDM and the resultant altered glucose\nmetabolism and disturbance in uterine blood flow. 14 Babies that are small-for-gestational age (SGA) and of low birth weight are\nalso seen and are due to placental dysfunction, twin birth and an earlier\ngestational age at delivery. 6 , 25 Evidence suggests that low Apgar scores at 5\u2009min are more\ncommon in babies born to women with PCOS. 6  Increased congenital anomalies are seen in infants born to women with PCOS and may\ninclude cardiac, neural tube, urogenital and gastrointestinal anomalies such as\nomphalocele ( Table\n3 ). 6 , 14 Perinatal morbidity is also increased, as is postnatal\nintensive care admission, and the need for pediatric support. 24 , 25 The cause of\nthis is likely to relate to the increased use of infertility treatment, multiple\ngestation and iatrogenic PTD due to GDM or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. 7 Several studies have demonstrated an increase in PTD before 37\u2009weeks of\ngestation. In one study, 17% of babies were born prior to 37\u2009weeks of gestation in\ncomparison to a rate of 8% in women without PCOS. 15 Within this same population babies, large-for-gestational age (LGA) (reported\nas >90% for growth) were more commonly found in the PCOS group at 16%, compared\nto the prevalence within the control population of 6%. 15 This finding was consistent even if GDM was absent and was independent of\nmaternal BMI. It is likely that the increase in LGA babies is due to underlying\nmetabolic and endocrine influences. 16 After the neonatal period, children born to mothers with PCOS have an\nincreased rate of hospitalizations in childhood and adolescence and had a greater\nprevalence of metabolic disorder, diseases of the nervous system and asthma ( Figure 2 ). 6   Table 3.

The effects of PCOS on the risk of developmental anomalies summarized\nwith crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) obtained in the logistic regression analyses are shown.\nAll statistically significant effects of PCOS in the adjusted\ncomparisons are shown in boldface.    All outcomes adjusted for IVF, multiple pregnancy, maternal age (<20,\n20\u201329, 30\u201339, 40+), smoking during pregnancy (yes, no or unreported),\ngestational diabetes, male gender, current age of offspring in years\n(<1, 1\u20132, 3\u20136, 6+).

Source: Reproduced with permission from The American College of Obstetricians\nand Gynecologists from Doherty et al. 6     Education should be given to women with PCOS in regard to lifestyle and dietary\nmeasures to ensure that their offspring\u2019s heath and BMI is optimized given the risk\nof disease in later life.    Future research  Due to the risks that PCOS imposes on women in pregnancy and to their offspring,\nfuture research should focus on evidence-based interventions to reduce the\npre-pregnancy-related morbidity associated with PCOS, which may lead to improvements\nin subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes, and techniques to minimize weight gain in\npregnancy.    Conclusion  The extent of adverse outcomes for women with PCOS and their children is increased\nacross the board; however, the rates appear to differ according to the features of\nPCOS present. Adequate support should be offered to institute lifelong lifestyle\nmodifications aiming for a target of a healthy weight, diet and exercise level that\ncan be maintained into later life and potentially considering medical and surgical\nintervention for weight management and glucose regulation if these other measures\nfail. Women should be informed of the increased risks of pregnancy complications and\nthe potential for adverse outcomes for their offspring.",
