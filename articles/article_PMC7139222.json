    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a metabolic\ndisorder and one of the most common endocrine\ndisorders in women of reproductive age, with an\nincidence of 4-18% ( 1 ). This syndrome is the main\ncause of anovulation in infertile women. Although\nPCOS was initially recognized by increasing androgen\nsecretion from adrenal glands and ovaries, hirsutism,\nirregular menstruation, large ovaries, increased number\nof primary and pre-anteral ovarian follicles, and\ndisturbances in the dominant follicle selection, today\nit is introduced as a disorder with multiple causes and\nmetabolic consequences ( 2 ). However, the pathogenesis\nof PCOS is complex and not completely understood.\nPrevious studies have shown that androgens and insulin\nplay key roles in the development of this disease ( 3 , 4 ).\nPCOS patients have higher serum levels of testosterone\nand insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and lower serum\nlevels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) compared to\nhealthy women ( 4 , 5 ). Many studies have found effective\noxidative stress in the pathogenesis of anovulation,\ninsulin resistance (IR), and hyperandrogenism in PCOS\npatients ( 6 ). Also, signs of high serum levels of oxidative\nstress, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduction\nof total antioxidant capacity (TAC) have been observed\nin PCOS patients ( 7 ).  Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein\nfrom the family of transforming growth factor-beta\n(TGF-\u03b2), secreted by granulosa cells of the antral\nfollicles (4-6 mm). AMH secretion gradually decreases\nduring follicular growth and cannot be distinguished in\nfollicles larger than 8 mm. Currently the serum level\nof AMH, as a valid indicator of ovarian function, is\ndetermined in women\u2019s fertility screening and PCOS\ndiagnosis, allowing for targeted treatment of infertility\n( 8 ). The concentration of AMH is related to the number\nof small follicles and ovarian reserve ( 6 , 9 ). The number\nof the small follicles is relatively constant during the\nmenstrual cycle and it seems that AMH concentration\nhas insignificant fluctuation during this time. As age\nincreases, AMH decreases gradually, indicating a\ndecrease in the number of ovarian follicles and reaching\nthe menopausal stage ( 9 ).  AMH has an inhibitory effect on the growth of\nprimordial follicles, thus preventing them from finishing\nearly in the life of a woman ( 10 , 11 ). In PCOS women,\nthe number of small follicles (2-5 mm) is 2 to 3 times\nthat of healthy women, which leads to an increase in\nthe concentration of AMH in these individuals ( 12 , 9 )\nand it seems that AMH concentration is effective in the\npathogenesis of PCOS and anovulation. The increased\nAMH reduces the sensitivity of the antral follicles to the\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and subsequently\nprevents both the selection of the dominant follicle\nand the growth of follicles in the antral phase ( 13 ).\nAlso AMH inhibits the aromatase enzyme, leading to a\ndecrease in the production of follicular estradiol, which\nin turn may be accompanied by a defect in the selection\nof the dominant follicle ( 14 ).  Nutritional status and obesity may affect the synthesis\nof AMH, as some studies have reported a decrease in\nAMH levels in obese women, indicating a negative\ncorrelation between AMH and BMI, while others\nhave not mentioned a correlation between nutritional\nfactors, body mass index (BMI) and AMH ( 14 , 15 ).\nThe prevalence of obesity is more than 50% in patients\nwith PCOS, leading to IR and increased insulin levels\nin these patients. Obesity may contribute to the clinical\ncomplications of PCOS, and hyperinsulinemia can\nbe associated with the termination of ovarian follicle\ngrowth ( 16 ).  In addition to energy storage, adipose tissue can\nsynthesize and secrete important metabolic proteins,\nincluding adipokines that regulate multiple biological\nactions ( 17 ). An adipokine, which accounts for about\n0.01% of plasma proteins, is adiponectin ( 18 ). This\nprotein has two receptors (ADIPO R1 and ADIPO R2)\nand pivotal roles in lipid metabolism, such as increasing\ninsulin sensitivity and employing anti-inflammatory\neffects ( 19 ). Several studies have shown that there is\ncorrelation between adiponectin deficiencies in adipose\ntissue and the reduction of ovarian reserve in obese\nPCOS and non-PCOS women ( 9 , 20 ). Some studies\nhave reported adiponectin reduction in PCOS patients,\nwhich may be due to obesity and IR ( 21 ). Also, it has\nbeen suggested that leptin and not adiponectin may affect\nthe synthesis of AMH in women. It seems that there is\na negative correlation between insulin and AMH levels,\nwhile there is a positive correlation between AMH and\nadiponectin ( 22 ).  Undoubtedly, the recognition of the factors involved in\nthe pathogenesis of PCOS and how they interferes with\nthe syndrome can lead to a better understanding of PCOS\nand therefore provides access to appropriate methods for\nits diagnosis and treatment. Regarding the importance of\nAMH, the prevalence of obesity and related dysfunction\nof adiponectin in PCOS, the aim of present study was to\ndetermine the correlation between AMH, adiponectin and\noxidative stress markers in PCOS patients.    Materials and Methods   Study subjects  In this cross-sectional study, 40 PCOS patients and\n40 healthy women aged 18-40 years were randomly\ndivided and evaluated in two groups. The sample\nsize was accepted by an academic static consult in\nrelated committee. PCOS and healthy subjects were\nselected by our gynecologist from her private clinic.\nThe diagnosis of PCOS was done based on Rotterdam\nCriteria ( 23 ). Exclusion criteria were: subjects with\ndiabetes, or underlying systemic disease, galactorrhea,\nany endocrine disease associated with thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin or 17\u03b1-hydroxy\nprogesterone levels, usage of drugs that affect the\nfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis\nor insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin during\nlast three months and using contraceptives during last\n4 weeks. Also, women with addiction to cigarette,\nnarcotics or alcohol, as well as women who were\ninvolved in regular exercise activities during the study\nperiod were excluded. This study was approved by\nthe Ethics Committee of Kermanshah University of\nMedical Sciences (KUMS.REC.1395.626) and the\npatients signed informed consent.    Sample collection  Blood samples were collected in similar conditions for\neach participant on the 3rd and 5th days of their menstrual\ncycle and after 8 hours of fasting. AMH Enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA, Beckman Coulter, USA)\nwas performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAdiponectin, gonadotropins and androgen were detected\nby chemiluminescence technique (Immulite 2000,\nSiemens, Germany). To evaluate IR, the HOMA-IR index\n(Homeostasis Model Assessment for IR) was used as\nfollows: fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) concentration\nx fasting insulin (\u03bcIU/mL) divided by constant 22.5; an\nindex > 2 indicated IR ( 21 ).    Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay  The TAC of the sera was assessed by Ferric reducing\nantioxidant power assay (FRAP) method. Briefly, serum\n(150 \u03bcl) was mixed with 1.5 ml of fresh FRAP reagent\n(10 mM 2, 4 , 6 - Tripyridyl-s-Triazine, 20 mM Fecl 3 ,\n6H 2 O solution and 300 mM acetate buffer pH=3.6), and\nincubated at 37\u02daC for 10 minutes. Then the absorbance\nwas measured at 593 nm using a spectrophotometer\n(Pharmacia, Novaspec II, Biochrom, England) and was\ncompared to a standard curve constructed with known\nconcentrations of FeSO4 7H\n2O. Results were expressed\nin \u00b5M ( 24 ).    Nitric oxide assay  Griess method was used for determination of the serum\nlevels of NO, which includes the conversion of nitrate to\nnitrite. Griess reagent facilitates the conversion of nitrite\nto a deep pink azo substance ( 25 ). Briefly, equal volumes\nof serum samples and Griess reagent were mixed and\nincubated at room temperature for 30-45 minutes. Next,\nthe absorbance rate was determined at 540 and 630 nm\nusing ELISA reader (STAT Fax 100, USA).    Statistical analysis  All data were analyzed by SPSS software version 18.0\n(Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and presented as mean \u00b1 SE.\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the normality\nof the data. To compare the two groups, independent\nt test was used and Pearson correlation coefficient was\nused to determine the relationship between variables. The\nsignificance level was considered at P\u22650.05.     Results  In this study 80 women with a mean age of 31.36 \u00b1 6.19\nyears were evaluated in two PCOS and control groups.\nThe subjects were similar in age in both groups. Although\nthe mean of BMI was higher in PCOS patients than in\nthe control group, this difference was not statistically\nsignificant ( Table 1 ).

Biochemical analyzes  AMH level in PCOS group was significantly\nhigher than in the normal group (5.16 \u00b1 5.30 vs.\n2.44 \u00b1 2.49) (P=0.007). Also, there was a significant\ndifference in the adiponectin level between the two\ngroups (P=0.029), as it was lower in the PCOS\ngroup compared to the control group (24.55 \u00b1 9.41\nvs. 30.57 \u00b1 14.23) ( Table 1 , Fig .1 ). There was no\nstatistically significant difference in the mean of FSH\nand luteinizing hormone (LH) levels between the two\ngroups, while the mean of both androgens in the PCOS\ngroup was significantly higher than in the control\ngroup (P=0.006 and P=0.002, respectively). Also, the\nmean of prolactin and TSH levels was higher in the\nPCOS group, but this difference was not significant\n( Table 1 , Fig .1 ).  The mean of fasting blood glucose (FBG) was not\nsignificantly different between the two groups, but the\nmean of insulin in the PCOS group was significantly\nhigher than in the control group (P=0.001). Also, the\nmean of insulin resistance-homeostatic model assessment\n(IR-HOMA) was significantly different between the two\ngroups (P=0.003), It was higher in the PCOS group than\ncontrol group ( Table 1 , Fig .2 ). Anti-oxidants and oxidative\nstress (OS) levels were evaluated in this study with two\nvariables: TAC and serum NO. The mean of TAC was\nlower in the PCOS group and the mean of NO was higher\nthan that of healthy subjects, but the difference was not\nstatistically significant ( Table 1 , Fig .2 ).    Correlation of variables in the PCOS patients  In the PCOS group, there was a significant negative\ncorrelation between age and AMH (P=0.002, r=-0.46),\nage and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S,\nP=0.045, r=-0.32), body mass index (BMI) and FSH\n(P=0.03, r=-0.34), and adiponectin and testosterone\n(P=0.02, r=-0.36). Also, There was a significant positive\ncorrelation between BMI and insulin (P=0.04, r=0.32)\nand IR (P=0.04, r=0.32), AMH and LH (P=0.10, r=0.4),\nDHEA-S and testosterone (P=0.003, r=0.45), DHEA-S\nand TAC (P=0.005, r=0.43), prolactin and nitric oxide\n(NO, P=0.04, r=0.42), and TSH and TAC (P=0.005,\nr=0.43). FBG (P=0.000, r=0.59) and insulin (P=0.000,\nr=0.99) also had a significant positive correlation with\nthe IR index (IR-HOMA).

Correlation between variables in the control subjects  In control subjects, there was a significant negative\ncorrelation between Age and AMH (P=0.000, r=-\n0.76), Age and testosterone (P=0.01, r=-0.39), AMH\nand adiponectin (P=0.03, r=-0.35), and AMH and FSH\n(P=0.005, r=-0.43). There was a significant positive\ncorrelation between age and FSH (P=0.037, r=0.33).\nAMH and testosterone (P=0.01, r=0.39), prolactin and\nTAC (P=0.002, r=0.48), FBG and insulin (P=0.004,\nr=0.45), FBG and IR-HOMA (P=0.000, r=0.61), insulin\nand IR-HOMA (P=0.000, r=0.98), and IR-HOMA and\nNO (P=0.45, r =0.44). In the control subjects, increasing\nin BMI leads to decreasing in adiponectin (P=0.001, r=-\n0.5) and DHEA-S (P=0.04, r=-0.34).     Discussion  Several factors were studied in this study, but the\nmost important results were the significant differences\nbetween AMH, adiponectin, androgens and IR between\nthe two groups of PCOS patients and healthy controls.\nWe observed significant correlations between these\nvariables in the two groups independently. PCOS group\nshowed biochemical features associated with PCOS,\nsuch as higher levels of androgens, insulin and IR. Also,\nthere was a higher AMH and lower adiponectin level in\nPCOS patients. The most important correlation found in\nthe PCOS group was a significant positive correlation\nbetween AMH and each of the factors LH, DHEA-S,\nTAC, prolactin, NO, BMI, insulin and IR. In addition,\nthere was a significant negative correlation between AMH\nand DHEA-S, BMI and FSH, adiponectin and testosterone\nin the PCOS group. However, in the control group, there\nwas a significant positive correlation between age and\nFSH, AMH and testosterone, prolactin and TAC, FBG\nand insulin, and IR and NO. On the other hand, there was\na significant negative correlation between age and AMH,\nage and testosterone, BMI and adiponectin, BMI and\nDHEA-S, AMH and adiponectin, and AMH and FSH in\nthis group.  The results of our study, similar to OlszaneckaGlinianowicz et al. ( 21 ), showed that PCOS as the most\ncommon endocrinopathology of women of reproductive\nage is accompanied with multiple metabolic changes,\nincluding increased androgen and insulin levels, and\nthe emergence of IR. Many studies have shown that at\nleast half of the people with PCOS are obese and that\nobesity plays a major role in the advent of IR in these\nindividuals ( 15 , 18 ). In our study, the mean of BMI of\nPCOS patients was higher than the control group but it\nwas not significant. This finding is in contrast with the\nstudy of Woo et al. ( 26 ).  Adiponectin plays an important role in anti-inflammatory\nprocesses, insulin sensitivity and obesity. The results of\nsome studies ( 16 , 17 ), consistent with our study, show\nthat adiponectin levels in PCOS patients are lower than\nin the healthy subjects, while in the study of Emadi et al.\n( 27 ), there was not a significant difference in the level of\nadiponectin when comparing the two groups. Considering\nthe prevalence of obesity in PCOS patients and the higher\nBMI in these subjects in our study, the lower mean of\nadiponectin and the increased mean of IR in this group\nwas predictable.  In recent years, AMH has been used as a key factor\nfor evaluating ovarian function and an indicator for\ndetermining the number of ovarian follicles and reverse.\nDue to the increase in the number of small follicles in the\novaries of PCOS patients, the increase of this hormone\nis not unexpected. In our study, after adjustment for\nage, AMH was significantly higher in the PCOS group,\nwhich was similar to the results of Woo et al. ( 26 ). Also,\nan increase in androgens and the number of follicles\nin PCOS group can lead to an increase the production\nof AMH, which may play a vital role in decreasing the\nsensitivity of growing follicles to FSH hormone. In the\npresent study, similar to the findings of Mahdi et al. ( 28 ),\nthe rate of androgens and AMH in the PCOS group is\nhigher than in the control group, which may be due to an\nimpairment in the production of AMH and androgens in\nthese individuals. While in the control group with normal\nlevels of androgens and AMH, there was a significant\npositive correlation between AMH and testosterone,\nwhich was similar to that of Woo et al. ( 26 ).  In some studies, the mean of FSH in patients with\nPCOS was higher than in the control group ( 26 , 28 ), while\nin the present study, the mean of FSH was lower in the\nPCOS group. Nonetheless, similar to Hamza et al. ( 6 ) the\ndifference that we observed was not significant. It can be\nsuggested that increasing the number of small follicles\nand the AMH secreted from them, which lowers the\nsensitivity of the follicles to FSH, can affect the level of\nFSH and decrease its effect on PCOS patients. In a number\nof studies, levels of LH have increased dramatically in the\nfollicular phase in PCOS patients. In our study, similar to\nMahdi et al. ( 28 ), the mean of LH was higher in the PCOS\ngroup. Also, Hamza et al. ( 6 ) did not show any significant\ndifference in the LH between the two groups.  There was a significant positive correlation between\nAMH and LH in the PCOS group and a significant\nnegative correlation between AMH and FSH in the\ncontrol group in the present study. In both groups the\nmean of AMH decreased with aging, which was similar to\nother previous studies ( 26 - 28 ). This decrease was due to a\ndecrease in the number of follicles and ovarian reserves in\nwomen with an approach to menopause. It is also thought\nthat with increasing age, the gonadotropins content in\nwomen should be increased ( 29 ). In our study, only in the\ncontrol group age had a significant positive correlation\nwith FSH. In the study by Swellam et al. ( 30 ), there was\na significant correlation between age and decreasing of\nandrogens in both groups, but in our study we did not find\nsuch correlation.  Although some studies have reported a negative\ncorrelation between AMH and BMI ( 31 , 15 ), in our study,\nthis correlation was not seen in either of the groups.\nInterestingly, the study by Nardo et al. ( 32 ) showed that\nAMH increased with increased activities of the subjects,\nand did not correlate with BMI. In our study we show that\nthe BMI of PCOS individuals has a positive correlation\nwith insulin level resistance, and a negative correlation\nwith FSH. The results of various studies ( 17 , 27 ) have\nshown that with increasing BMI, the levels of adiponectin\nin women decrease. However, in our study this was only\nobserved in the control group.  In the present study, the correlation between AMH\nand adiponectin was negative in both groups, but it was\nsignificant only in the control group. In the study of Woo\net al. ( 26 ), the correlation between AMH and adiponectin\nin the control group was direct and significant, which\nis the opposite of our findings; and in their PCOS\ngroup, there was no significant correlation between the\ntwo factors. In some of the previous studies ( 3 , 6 ), in\nthe PCOS group AMH has only a significant positive\ncorrelation with testosterone, which is different from our\nstudy results. The positive correlation between AMH and\ntestosterone can be biologically normal for all women\nof reproductive age. These findings confirm that ovarian\nhyperandrogenesis has stopped the growth of follicles and\nin turn has increased AMH production. In our study, the\nabsence of this association in the PCOS group may be\ndue to a significant increase of the androgens and AMH\nin the PCOS patients, which can disturb the study of\ncorrelations.  Regarding prolactin, there is a hypothesis that\npolycystic ovaries affect the activity of dopamine in the\nhypothalamus and cause hyperprolactinemia in these\npatients ( 32 ). In our study, the level of prolactin in PCOS\npatients was higher than in healthy controls, and it was\nsignificantly correlated with an increase in NO levels,\nwhile in the control group there was a significant positive\ncorrelation between prolactin and TAC. In the present\nstudy the rate of IR in PCOS patients was higher than\nin the control group, similar to another previous study\n( 17 ). Also, the correlation between IR and NO was found\nto be significant in the control group, which can be due\nto the effect of IR, which may also increase the level of\noxidative stress in reducing ovulation ( 7 ).  The correlations between variables in the present study\nand the significant differences between the two groups\ncan indicate the role of these factors in the pathogenesis\nof PCOS, which is a multifactorial disorder. More in\ndepth research is needed for a better understanding of\nthe molecular mechanism, cellular changes and gene\nexpression that initiate PCOS pathogenesis.    Conclusion  Adiponectin changes can lead to impaired ovarian\nfunction and ovarian hormones in the reproductive age\nand its deficiency in PCOS patients may be associated\nwith IR and increased insulin levels. Insulin is one of\nthe effective factors in increasing the number of antral\nfollicles and ultimately increasing ovarian volume. In\nwomen suffering from PCOS hyperinsulinemia may\nincrease AMH levels. So it can be concluded that the role\nof adiponectin in increasing insulin sensitivity plays a key\nrole in controlling the synthesis of AMH in women of\nreproductive age.",
