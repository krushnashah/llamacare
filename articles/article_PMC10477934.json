    "abstract": "What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference? International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist. The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations, with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout. This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (\u223c6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remains generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided. The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program. This effort was primarily funded by the Australian Government via the National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (APP1171592), supported by a partnership with American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Endocrine Society, European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology, and European Society for Endocrinology. The Commonwealth Government of Australia also supported Guideline translation through the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFCRI000266). HJT and AM are funded by NHMRC fellowships. JT is funded by a Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) fellowship. Guideline development group members were volunteers. Travel expenses were covered by the partnering organizations. Disclosures of interest were strictly managed according to NHMRC policy and are available with the full guideline, technical evidence report, peer review and responses (",
    "body": "What does this mean for those with PCOS?  Building on the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this Guideline updates and expands clinical questions, aiming to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care that meets their needs and improves health outcomes. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages including priority topics and outcomes for those with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their healthcare providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on improved education and awareness of healthcare professionals, partnership in care, and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered, in addition to resource availability across different settings. With effective translation, the Guideline will address priorities identified by women with PCOS, upskill healthcare professionals, empower consumers, improve care and outcomes, identify key research gaps, and promote vital future research.     Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive-aged women, with impacts across the lifespan from adolescence to post menopause. PCOS prevalence is between 10 to 13%, as confirmed in the guideline process ( Teede et al., 2010 ; Azziz et al., 2016 ). PCOS aetiology is complex; and clinical presentation is heterogeneous with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features ( Teede et al., 2010 ; Azziz et al., 2016 ). Women internationally experience delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care ( Gibson-Helm er al., 2017 ; Dokras et al., 2017 ; Teede et al., 2014 ). Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS remains inconsistent, with ongoing key evidence-practice gaps. Following on from the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( Teede et al., 2018a ; Teede et al., 2018b ), independently evaluated as high quality, this extensive update integrates current literature with previous systematic reviews and extends to new clinical questions prioritized by consumers. Ultimately, we aim to update, extend and translate rigorous, comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and treatment, to improve the lives of those with PCOS worldwide.  To do so, the Guideline leverages substantive government and society investment and brings together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. This comprehensive evidence-based Guideline is constructed from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice, with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality clinical service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The Guideline is supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of healthcare professionals and to empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program. Here, we summarize recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS.    Materials and methods  Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full Guideline and the technical report, which are available online ( www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos ) ( Misso and Teede, 2012 ). In brief, extensive healthcare professional and consumer or patient engagement informed the Guideline priority areas. International society-nominated panels from across three leading entities, four partner organizations and thirty-two collaborating entities, included consumers and experts in paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, sleep, bariatric/metabolic surgery, public health, other co-opted experts, project management, evidence synthesis and translation. Governance included an international advisory and a management committee, five guideline development groups (GDGs) with 56 members, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. The five GDGs covered i) Screening, diagnostic and risk assessment and life stage; ii) Psychological features and models of care; iii) Lifestyle management; iv) Management of nonfertility features; and v) Assessment and management of infertility. The leading entities; the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centres for Research Excellence in Women\u2019s Health in Reproductive Life and in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, led by Monash University, partnered with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Endocrine Society, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and collaborated with 32 other entities. With international meetings over 12 months fifty-five prioritized clinical questions involved 52 systematic and three narrative reviews, generating evidence-based and consensus recommendations with accompanying practice points. Committee members nominated by partner and collaborator organizations provided international peer review, and independent experts reviewed methods, which were then submitted to NHMRC for independent review. The target audience includes multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, consumers or patients, policy makers, and educators. The Guideline includes a focus on equity, cultural and ethnic diversity, avoidance of stigma and inclusivity (see full guideline for details).  Processes aligned with all elements of the AGREE-II tool for quality guideline assessment (Brouwers er al., 2010), with extensive evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Integrity assessment was integrated into guideline evidence synthesis processes and followed the Research Integrity in Guideline Development (RIGID) framework, with studies assessed against criteria from the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) tool and the Trustworthiness in RAndomised Controlled Trials (TRACT) checklist ( Mousa et al., 2023 ; Weibel at al., 2023 ; Mol et al., 2023 ). Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice ( Brouwers et al., 2010 ; National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009 ; National Health and Medical Research Council, 2007 ). Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations. Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, also evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) ( Table\u00a01 ).   Table 1.   Categories of PCOS guideline recommendations      PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.     The terms include \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cshould not\u201d, which are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and the evidence quality and are independent descriptors reflecting GDG judgement. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. \u201cShould\u201d is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cshould/could consider\u201d which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. \u201cShould not\u201d applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.  Evidence quality was categorized according to the GRADE framework, with judgments about the quality of the included studies and/or synthesized evidence incorporating risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and any other considerations (e.g., publication bias) that may influence evidence quality. These judgments considered study number and design, statistical data and importance of outcomes ( Table\u00a02 ). The quality of evidence reflects the confidence that the estimate of the effect is adequate to support each recommendation ( National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009 ), largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team. GRADE acknowledges that evidence quality is a continuum; any discrete categorization involves some arbitrary decisions; nevertheless, the advantages of simplicity, transparency, and clarity outweigh these limitations ( National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009 ).   Table 2.   Quality (certainty) of evidence categories (adapted from GRADE)            High   \u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295  Very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.          Moderate   \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef  Moderate confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is different.          Low   \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef  Limited confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.          Very Low   \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef  Very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.       GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.     The GRADE framework enabled structured and transparent consideration across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength ( National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009 ) and was completed at face to face guideline group meetings for all clinical questions ( Table\u00a03 ) (GRADE).   Table 3.   The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework recommendation strength          \u2756  Conditional recommendation against the option.         \u2756\u2756  Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison.         \u2756\u2756\u2756  Conditional recommendation for the option.         \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756  Strong recommendation for the option.      Notably, certainty of evidence varied across outcomes within each question. Here evidence certainty reflects the lowest certainty for the critical outcomes. Evidence was often stronger for the top ranked outcome, and high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were often present, despite overall low quality of evidence. These nuances were considered by the GDG for all question as per the technical report, with any apparent discrepancy between recommendation strength and evidence certainty justified in the full Guideline. Finally, we note that this is a living Guideline with annual evidence review in rapidly evolving areas.  The recommendations ( Table\u00a04 ) apply the category, descriptive terms, GRADE of the recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The full Guideline, technical evidence and administrative reports are available online ( www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos ). The Guideline outlines the clinical need for the question, the clinical question, the evidence summary, the recommendations and practice points, and a summary of the justification developed by the GDGs using the GRADE framework. Extensive international peer review from across the 39 organizations was then considered by each GDG and recommendations were reconsidered applying the GRADE framework if justified. The comprehensive evidence reviews, profiles, and GRADE frameworks supporting each recommendation can be found in the Technical Report. The administrative report on guideline development, disclosure of interest process and declarations, peer review feedback and responses can also be found online. Here, we present the evidence-based and consensus recommendations and practice points ( Table\u00a04 ). This summary, the full Guideline and technical reports are supported by a comprehensive co-designed translation program to optimize dissemination and impact with resources freely available online ( www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos ).

NO.  TYPE  RECOMMENDATION  GRADE/QUAITY       1     Screening, diagnostic and risk assessment and life-stages             General principles           PP  All diagnostic assessments are recommended for use in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm (Algorithm 1).           1.1     Irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction           1.1.1  CR   Irregular menstrual cycles are defined as:  Normal in the first year post menarche as part of the pubertal transition. 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days. 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year. 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle. Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche (breast development).  When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to these PCOS Guidelines.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.1.2  PP  The mean age of menarche may differ across populations.          1.1.3  PP  In adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles, the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the patient and their parent/s or guardian/s, considering diagnostic challenges at this life stage and psychosocial and cultural factors.          1.1.4  PP  For adolescents who have features of PCOS, but do not meet diagnostic criteria, an \u201cincreased risk\u201d could be considered and reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche. This includes those with PCOS features before combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) commencement, those with persisting features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence.          1.1.5  PP  Ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and if anovulation needs to be confirmed serum progesterone levels can be measured.           1.2     Biochemical hyperandrogenism           1.2.1  EBR  Healthcare professionals should use total and free testosterone to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis of PCOS; free testosterone can be estimated by the calculated free androgen index.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.2  EBR  If testosterone or free testosterone is not elevated, healthcare professionals could consider measuring androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), noting their poorer specificity and greater age associated decrease in DHEAS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.3  EBR  Laboratories should use validated, highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays for measuring total testosterone and if needed, for androstenedione and DHEAS. Free testosterone should be assessed by calculation, equilibrium dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.4  EBR  Laboratories should use LC-MS/MS assays over direct immunoassays (e.g., radiometric, enzyme-linked, etc.) for assessing total or free testosterone, which have limited accuracy and demonstrate poor sensitivity and precision for diagnosing hyperandrogenism in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.5  PP  For the detection of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is of greatest value in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (i.e., hirsutism).          1.2.6  PP  It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotrophin-dependent androgen production. If already on the COCP, and assessment of biochemical androgens is imperative, the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time.          1.2.7  PP  Repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role.          1.2.8  PP  In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age          1.2.9  PP  If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. However, some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels. The clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.     1.2.10  PP  Reference ranges for different methods and laboratories vary widely, and are often based on an arbitrary percentile or variances of the mean from a population that has not been fully characterized and is highly likely to include women with PCOS. Normal values should be determined either by the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of general population values.          1.2.11  PP  Laboratories involved in androgen measurements in females should consider: Determining laboratory normal values by either the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of the values of a large general population. Applying the most accurate methods where available. Using extraction/chromatography immunoassays as an alternative to mass spectrometry only where adequate expertise is available. Future improvements may arise from measurement of 11-oxygenated androgens, and from establishing cut-off levels or thresholds based on large-scale validation in populations of different ages and ethnicities.           1.3     Clinical hyperandrogenism           1.3.1  EBR  The presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.3.2  EBR  Healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.3.3  CR  A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, including acne, female pattern hair loss and hirsutism in adults, and severe acne and hirsutism in adolescents.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.4  CR  Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important, regardless of apparent clinical severity.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.5  CR  A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4 \u2013 6 should be used to detect hirsutism, depending on ethnicity, acknowledging that self-treatment is common and can limit clinical assessment.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.6  CR  Healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence of hirsutism appears similar across ethnicities.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.7  PP  Healthcare professionals should: Be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism, such as the mFG scale in combination\u00a0with a photographic atlas. Consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for assessing female pattern hair loss. Note that there are no universally accepted visual instruments for assessing the presence of acne. Recognize that women commonly treat clinical hyperandrogenism cosmetically, diminishing their apparent clinical severity. Appreciate that self-assessment of unwanted excess hair growth, and possibly acne and female pattern hair loss, has a high degree of validity and merits close evaluation, even if overt clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are not readily evident on examination. Note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism, and these can reach >5 mm if untreated, vary in shape and texture, and are generally pigmented. Note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, requires further investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis. Monitor clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne and female pattern hair loss, for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.           1.4     Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology           1.4.1  EBR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) should be considered the most effective ultrasound marker to detect polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.4.2  EBR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), follicle number per cross-section (FNPS) and ovarian volume (OV) should be considered accurate ultrasound markers for PCOM in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.4.3  CR  PCOM criteria should be based on follicle excess (FNPO, FNPS) and/or ovarian enlargement.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.4.4  CR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) \u2265 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756    1.4.5  CR  Ovarian volume (OV) \u2265 10\u2009ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) \u2265 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold for PCOM if using older technology or image quality is insufficient to allow for an accurate assessment of follicle counts throughout the entire ovary.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.4.6  PP  There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents.          1.4.7  PP  When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM.          1.4.8  PP  Transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report ovarian volume (OV) with a threshold of \u2265 10 ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) \u2265 10 in either ovary in adults given the difficulty of assessing follicle counts throughout the entire ovary with this approach.          1.4.9  PP  In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis.          1.4.10  PP  Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-speci\ufb01c cut-off values for PCOM should be de\ufb01ned.          1.4.11  PP  There is a need for training in careful and meticulous follicle counting per ovary and clear standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound including at a minimum: Last menstrual period (or stage of cycle). Transducer bandwidth frequency. Approach/route assessed. Total number of 2\u20139 mm follicles per ovary. Measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary. Other ovarian features and/or pathology including ovarian cysts, corpus lutea, dominant follicles (\u226510 mm) (which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations). Reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO for diagnosis of PCOM, where a dominant follicle is noted. Uterine features and/or pathology including endometrial thickness and pattern.           1.5     Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone in the diagnosis of PCOS           1.5.1  EBR  Serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) could be used for defining PCOM in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.2  EBR  Serum AMH should only be used in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm, noting that in patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an AMH level is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.3  EBR  We recommend that serum AMH should not be used as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.4  EBR  Serum AMH should not yet be used in adolescents.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.5  PP  Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM; however, both tests should not be performed to limit overdiagnosis.          1.5.6  PP  Laboratories and healthcare professionals need to be aware of factors that influence AMH in the general population including: Age: Serum AMH generally peaks between the ages of 20\u201325 years in the general population.

Assist women with PCOS and healthcare professionals in forming realistic, tailored lifestyle goals.           3.6     Weight Stigma           3.6.1  EBR  Many women with PCOS experience weight stigma in healthcare and other settings and the negative biopsychosocial impacts of this should be recognized.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          3.6.2  CR  Healthcare professionals should be aware of their weight biases and the impact this has on their professional practice and on women with PCOS.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         3.6.3  CR  Health policy makers, managers and educators should promote awareness of weight stigma and invest in weight stigma education and minimization strategies.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756    3.6.4  PP  Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight-inclusive practices which promote acceptance of and respect for body size diversity and focus on improvement of health behaviours and health outcomes for people of all sizes. In PCOS this includes: Acknowledging that whilst higher weight is a risk factor for PCOS and its complications, it is only one indicator of health and broader factors should be assessed. Asking permission to discuss and measure weight and using strategies to minimize discomfort (e.g., blind weighing). Recognizing that the terms \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cobese/obesity\u201d can be stigmatizing with suggested alternatives including \u201chigher weight\u201d. If weighing, explaining how weight information will be used to inform risks, prevention and treatment and how not knowing may impact on recommendations. Ensuring appropriate equipment is available for women of all sizes. Offering options of weight-centric care (promoting intentional weight loss) or weight-inclusive care (promoting healthy lifestyle change without focusing on intentional weight loss) tailored to individual goals and preferences. Offering all women best practice assessment, treatment and support regardless of weight, acknowledging that weight may be a non-modifiable risk factor when using lifestyle modification alone.          3.6.5  PP  Increasing awareness of weight stigma among family members of women and adolescents with PCOS should be considered.           4     Management of non-fertility features            4.1     Pharmacology treatment principles in PCOS            PP  Shared decision making between the patient (and parent/s or guardian/s, if the patient is a child) and the healthcare professional is required.      PP  An individual\u2019s characteristics, preferences and values must be elicited and considered when recommending any intervention alone or in combination.      PP  Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications.      PP  Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.           4.2     Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills           4.2.1  EBR  Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) could be recommended in reproductive age adults with PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.2  EBR  The COCP could be considered in adolescents at risk or with a clear diagnosis of PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.3  EBR  Healthcare professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (\u2265 30 \u03bcg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30\u2009\u03bcg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.4  EBR  General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.5  EBR  The 35\u03bcg ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate preparations should be considered as second-line therapy, versus other COCPs, balancing benefits and adverse effects, including venous thromboembolic risks.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.6  EBR  Progestin only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.7  PP  When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS It is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies. Shared decision-making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence. Natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses (such as 20\u201330\u2009\u03bcg of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent), need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side effects, cost, and availability. The relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines. The relative and absolute contraindications and side effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion. PCOS specific features, such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors, need to be considered.           4.3     Metformin           4.3.1  EBR  Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 for anthropometric, and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.3.2  EBR  Metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.3.3  CR  Metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , acknowledging limited evidence.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.3.4  PP  Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: Shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention. Women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy. Mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting. Starting at a low dose, with 500\u2009mg increments 1\u20132 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence. Suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5\u2009g in adults and 2g in adolescents. Use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered. Use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, especially in those with risk factors for low vitamin B12 (e.g., diabetes, post bariatric / metabolic surgery, pernicious anaemia, vegan diet etc.), where monitoring should be considered.           4.4     Metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills           4.4.1  EBR  COCP could be used over metformin for management of hirsutism in irregular menstrual cycles in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.2  EBR  Metformin could be used over COCP for metabolic indications in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.3  EBR  The combination of COCP and metformin could be considered to offer little additional clinical benefit over COCP or metformin alone, in adults with PCOS with a BMI \u2264 30 kg/m 2 .   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.4.  PP  In combination with the COCP, metformin may be most beneficial in high metabolic risk groups including those with a BMI >30 kg/m 2 , diabetes risk factors, impaired glucose tolerance or high-risk ethnic groups.          4.4.5  PP  Where COCP is contraindicated, not accepted or not tolerated, metformin may be considered for irregular menstrual cycles. For hirsutism, other interventions may be needed.           4.5     Anti-obesity pharmacological agents           4.5.1  CR  Anti-obesity medications including liraglutide, semaglutide, both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and orlistat, could be considered, in addition to active lifestyle intervention, for the management of higher weight in adults with PCOS as per general population guidelines.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.5.2  PP  Healthcare professionals should ensure concurrent effective contraception when pregnancy is possible for women who take GLP-1 receptor agonists, as pregnancy safety data are lacking.          4.5.3  PP  Gradual dose escalation for GLP-1 receptor agonists is recommended to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects.          4.5.4  PP  Shared decision making, when discussing GLP-1 receptor agonist use with women with PCOS, needs to consider side effects, and the potential need for long-term use in weight management, given the high risk for weight regain after discontinuation, and the lack of long-term safety data.           4.6     Anti-androgen pharmacological agents           4.6.1  EBR  In combination with effective contraception, anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS, if there is a suboptimal response after a minimum of six months of COCP and/or cosmetic therapy.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef     4.6.2  CR  Given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed, acknowledging the lack of evidence in the PCOS population.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.6.3  PP  Whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women and adolescents, parents/s or guardian/s, regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses (undervirilization) when anti-androgens are used. To prevent this, women who can get pregnant should be strongly counselled to use effective contraception (e.g., intrauterine device or COCPs).          4.6.4  PP  Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism, in the presence of another effective form of contraception, for women with contraindications for COCP therapy or when COCPs are poorly tolerated.          4.6.5  PP  When prescribing anti-androgens, based on general population recommendations, healthcare professionals should consider that: Spironolactone at 25\u2013100\u2009mg/day appears to have lower risks of adverse effects. Cyproterone acetate at doses \u226510\u2009mg\u00a0is not advised due to an increased risk including for meningioma. Finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity. Flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity. The relatively limited evidence on anti-androgens in PCOS needs to be appreciated with small numbers of studies and limited numbers of participants.           4.7     Inositol           4.7.1  EBR  Inositol (in any form) could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values, noting limited harm, potential for improvement in metabolic measures, yet with limited clinical benefits including in ovulation, hirsutism or weight.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.7.2  EBR  Metformin should be considered over inositol for hirsutism and central adiposity, noting that metformin has more gastrointestinal side effects than inositol.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.7.3  PP  Women taking inositol and other complementary therapies are encouraged to advise their healthcare professional.          4.7.4  PP  Specific types, doses or combinations of inositol cannot currently be recommended in adults and adolescents with PCOS, due to a lack of quality evidence.          4.7.5  PP  Shared decision making should include discussion that regulatory status and quality control of inositol in any form (like other nutrient supplements) can differ from those for pharmacological products and doses and qualities may vary.          4.7.6  PP  Policy makers and healthcare professionals have a responsibility to ensure women have access to unconflicted, evidence-based information to inform shared-decision making, whilst also acknowledging and respecting individual values and preferences, including for complementary therapies.           4.8     Mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction           4.8.1  EBR  Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism and for related depression, anxiety, and quality of life in women with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.8.2  EBR  A greater number of laser treatment sessions may be required in women with PCOS, compared to women with idiopathic hirsutism, to achieve hair reduction.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.8.3  CR  Adverse effects appear limited in the hands of experienced and suitably qualified providers, and women should be encouraged to seek hair reduction therapies from such providers.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         4.8.4  PP  Where laser hair removal is prescribed, the following need to be considered: Wavelength and delivery of laser treatment varies by skin and hair colour. Laser is relatively ineffective in women with blond, grey or white hair. The addition of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), with or without anti-androgens, to laser treatment may provide greater hair reduction and maintenance compared to laser alone. Low and high fluence laser appear to have similar efficacy in reducing facial hair, while low fluence laser has reduced associated pain.          4.8.5  PP  Mechanical hair removal with Intense Pulse Light (IPL) could be considered, albeit benefits may be less pronounced compared to laser treatment. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of home-based IPL kits.          4.8.6  PP  Policy makers should consider funding\u00a0this evidence-based effective therapy for women with PCOS to alleviate distressing symptoms of hirsutism, and related negative impact on quality of life, body image, and psychological health.      4.9     Bariatric/ metabolic surgery           4.9.1  CR  Bariatric/ metabolic surgery could be considered to improve weight loss, hypertension, diabetes (prevention and treatment), hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.2  CR  Bariatric/ metabolic surgery in women with PCOS should be informed by general population guidelines.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.3  CR  PCOS is a metabolic condition and could be considered an indication at a lower BMI threshold for bariatric/ metabolic surgery similarly to other metabolic conditions including diabetes.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.4  CR  Women should be strongly counselled on the likelihood of rapid return of fertility and the need to commit to effective contraception, ideally prior to surgery. Even when pregnancy is desired, contraception should be continued until a stable weight is achieved, usually after one year, to avoid significantly increased risk of growth restriction, prematurity, small for gestational age, pregnancy complications, and prolonged hospitalization of the infant.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756          4.10     Pregnancy outcomes           4.10.1  EBR  Women with PCOS have higher risk pregnancies, and healthcare professionals should ensure that PCOS status is identified during antenatal care, and appropriate\u00a0monitoring and support is provided.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.2  EBR  Healthcare professionals should recognize that pregnant women with PCOS have an increased risk of: Higher gestational weight gain. Miscarriage. Gestational diabetes. Hypertension in pregnancy and preeclampsia. Intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age babies and low birth weight. Preterm delivery. Caesarean section.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.3  EBR  Assisted reproductive technology in women with PCOS should be considered as not conferring additional risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, impaired fetal growth, and caesarean section, over that observed in women without PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.4  EBR  Women with PCOS should be considered as not having an increased risk of large for gestational age babies, macrosomia and instrumental delivery.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.5  PP  Early lifestyle intervention should be offered to pregnant women with PCOS, given the risk of higher baseline weight, excess gestational weight gain and pregnancy complications.          4.10.6  PP  Blood pressure measurement should be performed when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given the high risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and the associated comorbidities in women with PCOS.          4.10.7  PP  An OGTT should be offered to all women with PCOS when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given the high risk of hyperglycaemia and the associated comorbidities in pregnancy. If not performed in the preconception phase, an OGTT should be offered at the first antenatal visit and repeated at 24-28 weeks gestation.           4.11     Metformin in pregnancy           4.11.1  EBR  Healthcare professionals should be aware that metformin in pregnant women with PCOS has not been shown to prevent: Gestational diabetes. Late miscarriage (12 weeks\u2009+\u20091 day to 21 weeks\u2009+\u20096 days gestational age). Hypertension in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia. Macrosomia or birthweight \u2265 4000 g.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          4.11.2  EBR  Metformin could be considered in some circumstances (e.g., risk for preterm birth) to reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain, in pregnant women with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          4.11.3  PP  Women should be counselled that the consequences of metformin exposure on long-term offspring health remain unclear and there is a suggestion of increased childhood weight, although causality is not certain.          4.11.4  PP  Side effects of metformin are mostly mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms and are not worse in pregnancy.      5     Assessment and treatment of infertility              General principles            PP  All fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2).           PP  Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance.           PP  Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care.           PP  Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy.           PP  The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries. Where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects.

Discussion  The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (\u223c6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.  Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies is needed. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.  Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet routinely available measures of insulin resistance are inaccurate and clinical measurement is not currently recommended. Once diagnosed, assessment and management should address reproductive, metabolic, cardiovascular, dermatologic, sleep, and psychological features. A lifelong health plan is recommended including a focus on healthy lifestyle, prevention of excess weight gain, optimization of fertility and preconception risk factors, and prevention and treatment of diverse clinical features. These include metabolic risk factors, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disorders, which are all increased in PCOS. PCOS should be considered a high-risk condition in pregnancy with women identified and monitored. An increased premenopausal risk of endometrial cancer should also be recognized, whilst absolute risks remain low.  Symptoms of depression and anxiety are significantly increased and should be screened for in all women with PCOS, with psychological assessment and therapy as indicated. Greater awareness of psychological features including eating disorders and impacts on body image and quality of life is needed.  Dissatisfaction with PCOS diagnosis and care is high and significant improvement in education and awareness is strongly recommended for women and healthcare professionals including high quality, evidence-based resources. Shared decision making and self-empowerment are fundamental and integrated models of care should be codesigned, funded and evaluated.  Supported healthy lifestyle remains vital throughout the lifespan in PCOS, with a strong focus on overall health, prevention of weight gain and, if required, on weight management. Recognizing the benefits of many diet and physical activity regimens, there is no one specific regimen that has benefits over others in PCOS. Weight bias and stigma should be minimized and healthcare professionals should seek permission to weigh women, with explanation of weight-related risks.  Combined oral contraceptive pills are the first line pharmacological treatment for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific recommended preparation and a preference for lower ethinyl estradiol dose preparations and those with less side-effects. Metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic features and has greater efficacy than inositol, which offers limited clinical benefits in PCOS. Metformin is not routinely recommended for use in pregnant women with PCOS. Mechanical laser therapy is effective for hair reduction in some subgroups, whilst anti-androgens have a limited role where other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Anti-obesity agents and bariatric/metabolic surgery may be considered based on general population guidelines, balancing potential for benefits and side effects.  Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation , as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.  Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.  The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence ( www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos ). The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15-20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online ( www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos ). Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.",

Free testosterone should be assessed by calculation, equilibrium dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.4  EBR  Laboratories should use LC-MS/MS assays over direct immunoassays (e.g., radiometric, enzyme-linked, etc.) for assessing total or free testosterone, which have limited accuracy and demonstrate poor sensitivity and precision for diagnosing hyperandrogenism in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.2.5  PP  For the detection of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is of greatest value in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (i.e., hirsutism).          1.2.6  PP  It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotrophin-dependent androgen production. If already on the COCP, and assessment of biochemical androgens is imperative, the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time.          1.2.7  PP  Repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role.          1.2.8  PP  In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age          1.2.9  PP  If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. However, some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels. The clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.     1.2.10  PP  Reference ranges for different methods and laboratories vary widely, and are often based on an arbitrary percentile or variances of the mean from a population that has not been fully characterized and is highly likely to include women with PCOS. Normal values should be determined either by the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of general population values.          1.2.11  PP  Laboratories involved in androgen measurements in females should consider: Determining laboratory normal values by either the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of the values of a large general population. Applying the most accurate methods where available. Using extraction/chromatography immunoassays as an alternative to mass spectrometry only where adequate expertise is available. Future improvements may arise from measurement of 11-oxygenated androgens, and from establishing cut-off levels or thresholds based on large-scale validation in populations of different ages and ethnicities.           1.3     Clinical hyperandrogenism           1.3.1  EBR  The presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.3.2  EBR  Healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.3.3  CR  A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, including acne, female pattern hair loss and hirsutism in adults, and severe acne and hirsutism in adolescents.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.4  CR  Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important, regardless of apparent clinical severity.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.5  CR  A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4 \u2013 6 should be used to detect hirsutism, depending on ethnicity, acknowledging that self-treatment is common and can limit clinical assessment.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.6  CR  Healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence of hirsutism appears similar across ethnicities.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.3.7  PP  Healthcare professionals should: Be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism, such as the mFG scale in combination\u00a0with a photographic atlas. Consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for assessing female pattern hair loss. Note that there are no universally accepted visual instruments for assessing the presence of acne. Recognize that women commonly treat clinical hyperandrogenism cosmetically, diminishing their apparent clinical severity. Appreciate that self-assessment of unwanted excess hair growth, and possibly acne and female pattern hair loss, has a high degree of validity and merits close evaluation, even if overt clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are not readily evident on examination. Note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism, and these can reach >5 mm if untreated, vary in shape and texture, and are generally pigmented. Note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, requires further investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis. Monitor clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne and female pattern hair loss, for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.           1.4     Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology           1.4.1  EBR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) should be considered the most effective ultrasound marker to detect polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.4.2  EBR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), follicle number per cross-section (FNPS) and ovarian volume (OV) should be considered accurate ultrasound markers for PCOM in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.4.3  CR  PCOM criteria should be based on follicle excess (FNPO, FNPS) and/or ovarian enlargement.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.4.4  CR  Follicle number per ovary (FNPO) \u2265 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756    1.4.5  CR  Ovarian volume (OV) \u2265 10\u2009ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) \u2265 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold for PCOM if using older technology or image quality is insufficient to allow for an accurate assessment of follicle counts throughout the entire ovary.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         1.4.6  PP  There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents.          1.4.7  PP  When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM.          1.4.8  PP  Transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report ovarian volume (OV) with a threshold of \u2265 10 ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) \u2265 10 in either ovary in adults given the difficulty of assessing follicle counts throughout the entire ovary with this approach.          1.4.9  PP  In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis.          1.4.10  PP  Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-speci\ufb01c cut-off values for PCOM should be de\ufb01ned.          1.4.11  PP  There is a need for training in careful and meticulous follicle counting per ovary and clear standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound including at a minimum: Last menstrual period (or stage of cycle). Transducer bandwidth frequency. Approach/route assessed. Total number of 2\u20139 mm follicles per ovary. Measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary. Other ovarian features and/or pathology including ovarian cysts, corpus lutea, dominant follicles (\u226510 mm) (which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations). Reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO for diagnosis of PCOM, where a dominant follicle is noted. Uterine features and/or pathology including endometrial thickness and pattern.           1.5     Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone in the diagnosis of PCOS           1.5.1  EBR  Serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) could be used for defining PCOM in adults.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.2  EBR  Serum AMH should only be used in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm, noting that in patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an AMH level is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.3  EBR  We recommend that serum AMH should not be used as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.4  EBR  Serum AMH should not yet be used in adolescents.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          1.5.5  PP  Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM; however, both tests should not be performed to limit overdiagnosis.          1.5.6  PP  Laboratories and healthcare professionals need to be aware of factors that influence AMH in the general population including: Age: Serum AMH generally peaks between the ages of 20\u201325 years in the general population. Body mass index (BMI): Serum AMH is lower in those with higher BMI\u00a0in the general population. Hormonal contraception and ovarian surgery: Serum AMH may be suppressed by current or recent COCP use. Menstrual cycle day: Serum AMH may vary across the menstrual cycle.          1.5.7  PP  Laboratories involved in AMH measurements in females should use population and assay specific cut-offs.           1.6     Ethnic variation           1.6.1  EBR  Healthcare professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of PCOS in all ethnicities and across world regions, ranging from 10\u201313% globally using the Rotterdam criteria.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          1.6.2  EBR  Healthcare professionals should be aware that PCOS prevalence is broadly similar across world regions, but may be higher in South East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef     1.6.3  PP  Healthcare professionals should be aware that the presentation of PCOS may vary across ethnic groups.           1.7     Menopause life stage           1.7.1  CR  A diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring\u00a0/ lifelong.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.7.2  CR  Healthcare professionals could consider that both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.7.3  CR  PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis, or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the earlier reproductive years (age 20\u201340).  \u2756\u2756\u2756         1.7.4  CR  Further investigations should be considered to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism.  \u2756\u2756\u2756          1.8     Cardiovascular disease risk           1.8.1  EBR  Women with PCOS should be considered at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and potentially of cardiovascular mortality, acknowledging that the overall risk of cardiovascular disease in pre-menopausal women is low.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.8.2  EBR  All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular disease risk factors.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          1.8.3  CR  All women with PCOS, regardless of age and BMI, should have a lipid profile (cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride level) at diagnosis.

Adults should limit the amount of time spent being sedentary (e.g., sitting, screen time) as replacing sedentary time with physical activity of any intensity (including light\u00a0intensity) provides health benefits. For the prevention of weight gain and maintenance of health, adults (18\u201364 years) should aim for a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity activities or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activity per week or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week, plus muscle strengthening activities (e.g., resistance/flexibility) on two non-consecutive days per week. For promotion of greater health benefits including modest weight-loss and prevention of weight-regain, adults (18\u201364 years) should aim for a minimum of 250 min/week of moderate intensity activities or 150 min/week of vigorous intensities or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle strengthening activities (e.g., resistance/flexibility) ideally on two non-consecutive days per week. Adolescents should aim for at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per day, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone at least three times per week.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         3.4.4  PP  Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure.

In PCOS this includes: Acknowledging that whilst higher weight is a risk factor for PCOS and its complications, it is only one indicator of health and broader factors should be assessed. Asking permission to discuss and measure weight and using strategies to minimize discomfort (e.g., blind weighing). Recognizing that the terms \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cobese/obesity\u201d can be stigmatizing with suggested alternatives including \u201chigher weight\u201d. If weighing, explaining how weight information will be used to inform risks, prevention and treatment and how not knowing may impact on recommendations. Ensuring appropriate equipment is available for women of all sizes. Offering options of weight-centric care (promoting intentional weight loss) or weight-inclusive care (promoting healthy lifestyle change without focusing on intentional weight loss) tailored to individual goals and preferences. Offering all women best practice assessment, treatment and support regardless of weight, acknowledging that weight may be a non-modifiable risk factor when using lifestyle modification alone.          3.6.5  PP  Increasing awareness of weight stigma among family members of women and adolescents with PCOS should be considered.           4     Management of non-fertility features            4.1     Pharmacology treatment principles in PCOS            PP  Shared decision making between the patient (and parent/s or guardian/s, if the patient is a child) and the healthcare professional is required.      PP  An individual\u2019s characteristics, preferences and values must be elicited and considered when recommending any intervention alone or in combination.      PP  Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications.      PP  Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.           4.2     Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills           4.2.1  EBR  Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) could be recommended in reproductive age adults with PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.2  EBR  The COCP could be considered in adolescents at risk or with a clear diagnosis of PCOS for management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.3  EBR  Healthcare professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (\u2265 30 \u03bcg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30\u2009\u03bcg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.4  EBR  General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.5  EBR  The 35\u03bcg ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate preparations should be considered as second-line therapy, versus other COCPs, balancing benefits and adverse effects, including venous thromboembolic risks.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.6  EBR  Progestin only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.2.7  PP  When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS It is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies. Shared decision-making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence. Natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses (such as 20\u201330\u2009\u03bcg of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent), need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side effects, cost, and availability. The relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines. The relative and absolute contraindications and side effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion. PCOS specific features, such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors, need to be considered.           4.3     Metformin           4.3.1  EBR  Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 for anthropometric, and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.3.2  EBR  Metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.3.3  CR  Metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , acknowledging limited evidence.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.3.4  PP  Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: Shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention. Women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy. Mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting. Starting at a low dose, with 500\u2009mg increments 1\u20132 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence. Suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5\u2009g in adults and 2g in adolescents. Use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered. Use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, especially in those with risk factors for low vitamin B12 (e.g., diabetes, post bariatric / metabolic surgery, pernicious anaemia, vegan diet etc.), where monitoring should be considered.           4.4     Metformin and combined oral contraceptive pills           4.4.1  EBR  COCP could be used over metformin for management of hirsutism in irregular menstrual cycles in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.2  EBR  Metformin could be used over COCP for metabolic indications in PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.3  EBR  The combination of COCP and metformin could be considered to offer little additional clinical benefit over COCP or metformin alone, in adults with PCOS with a BMI \u2264 30 kg/m 2 .   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.4.4.

For hirsutism, other interventions may be needed.           4.5     Anti-obesity pharmacological agents           4.5.1  CR  Anti-obesity medications including liraglutide, semaglutide, both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and orlistat, could be considered, in addition to active lifestyle intervention, for the management of higher weight in adults with PCOS as per general population guidelines.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.5.2  PP  Healthcare professionals should ensure concurrent effective contraception when pregnancy is possible for women who take GLP-1 receptor agonists, as pregnancy safety data are lacking.          4.5.3  PP  Gradual dose escalation for GLP-1 receptor agonists is recommended to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects.          4.5.4  PP  Shared decision making, when discussing GLP-1 receptor agonist use with women with PCOS, needs to consider side effects, and the potential need for long-term use in weight management, given the high risk for weight regain after discontinuation, and the lack of long-term safety data.           4.6     Anti-androgen pharmacological agents           4.6.1  EBR  In combination with effective contraception, anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS, if there is a suboptimal response after a minimum of six months of COCP and/or cosmetic therapy.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef     4.6.2  CR  Given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed, acknowledging the lack of evidence in the PCOS population.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.6.3  PP  Whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women and adolescents, parents/s or guardian/s, regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses (undervirilization) when anti-androgens are used. To prevent this, women who can get pregnant should be strongly counselled to use effective contraception (e.g., intrauterine device or COCPs).          4.6.4  PP  Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism, in the presence of another effective form of contraception, for women with contraindications for COCP therapy or when COCPs are poorly tolerated.          4.6.5  PP  When prescribing anti-androgens, based on general population recommendations, healthcare professionals should consider that: Spironolactone at 25\u2013100\u2009mg/day appears to have lower risks of adverse effects. Cyproterone acetate at doses \u226510\u2009mg\u00a0is not advised due to an increased risk including for meningioma. Finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity. Flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity. The relatively limited evidence on anti-androgens in PCOS needs to be appreciated with small numbers of studies and limited numbers of participants.           4.7     Inositol           4.7.1  EBR  Inositol (in any form) could be considered in women with PCOS based on individual preferences and values, noting limited harm, potential for improvement in metabolic measures, yet with limited clinical benefits including in ovulation, hirsutism or weight.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.7.2  EBR  Metformin should be considered over inositol for hirsutism and central adiposity, noting that metformin has more gastrointestinal side effects than inositol.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.7.3  PP  Women taking inositol and other complementary therapies are encouraged to advise their healthcare professional.          4.7.4  PP  Specific types, doses or combinations of inositol cannot currently be recommended in adults and adolescents with PCOS, due to a lack of quality evidence.          4.7.5  PP  Shared decision making should include discussion that regulatory status and quality control of inositol in any form (like other nutrient supplements) can differ from those for pharmacological products and doses and qualities may vary.          4.7.6  PP  Policy makers and healthcare professionals have a responsibility to ensure women have access to unconflicted, evidence-based information to inform shared-decision making, whilst also acknowledging and respecting individual values and preferences, including for complementary therapies.           4.8     Mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction           4.8.1  EBR  Mechanical laser and light therapies should be considered for reducing facial hirsutism and for related depression, anxiety, and quality of life in women with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.8.2  EBR  A greater number of laser treatment sessions may be required in women with PCOS, compared to women with idiopathic hirsutism, to achieve hair reduction.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.8.3  CR  Adverse effects appear limited in the hands of experienced and suitably qualified providers, and women should be encouraged to seek hair reduction therapies from such providers.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         4.8.4  PP  Where laser hair removal is prescribed, the following need to be considered: Wavelength and delivery of laser treatment varies by skin and hair colour. Laser is relatively ineffective in women with blond, grey or white hair. The addition of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), with or without anti-androgens, to laser treatment may provide greater hair reduction and maintenance compared to laser alone. Low and high fluence laser appear to have similar efficacy in reducing facial hair, while low fluence laser has reduced associated pain.          4.8.5  PP  Mechanical hair removal with Intense Pulse Light (IPL) could be considered, albeit benefits may be less pronounced compared to laser treatment. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of home-based IPL kits.          4.8.6  PP  Policy makers should consider funding\u00a0this evidence-based effective therapy for women with PCOS to alleviate distressing symptoms of hirsutism, and related negative impact on quality of life, body image, and psychological health.      4.9     Bariatric/ metabolic surgery           4.9.1  CR  Bariatric/ metabolic surgery could be considered to improve weight loss, hypertension, diabetes (prevention and treatment), hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.2  CR  Bariatric/ metabolic surgery in women with PCOS should be informed by general population guidelines.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.3  CR  PCOS is a metabolic condition and could be considered an indication at a lower BMI threshold for bariatric/ metabolic surgery similarly to other metabolic conditions including diabetes.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         4.9.4  CR  Women should be strongly counselled on the likelihood of rapid return of fertility and the need to commit to effective contraception, ideally prior to surgery. Even when pregnancy is desired, contraception should be continued until a stable weight is achieved, usually after one year, to avoid significantly increased risk of growth restriction, prematurity, small for gestational age, pregnancy complications, and prolonged hospitalization of the infant.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756          4.10     Pregnancy outcomes           4.10.1  EBR  Women with PCOS have higher risk pregnancies, and healthcare professionals should ensure that PCOS status is identified during antenatal care, and appropriate\u00a0monitoring and support is provided.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.2  EBR  Healthcare professionals should recognize that pregnant women with PCOS have an increased risk of: Higher gestational weight gain. Miscarriage. Gestational diabetes. Hypertension in pregnancy and preeclampsia. Intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age babies and low birth weight. Preterm delivery. Caesarean section.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.3  EBR  Assisted reproductive technology in women with PCOS should be considered as not conferring additional risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, impaired fetal growth, and caesarean section, over that observed in women without PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.4  EBR  Women with PCOS should be considered as not having an increased risk of large for gestational age babies, macrosomia and instrumental delivery.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          4.10.5  PP  Early lifestyle intervention should be offered to pregnant women with PCOS, given the risk of higher baseline weight, excess gestational weight gain and pregnancy complications.          4.10.6  PP  Blood pressure measurement should be performed when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given the high risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and the associated comorbidities in women with PCOS.          4.10.7  PP  An OGTT should be offered to all women with PCOS when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given the high risk of hyperglycaemia and the associated comorbidities in pregnancy. If not performed in the preconception phase, an OGTT should be offered at the first antenatal visit and repeated at 24-28 weeks gestation.           4.11     Metformin in pregnancy           4.11.1  EBR  Healthcare professionals should be aware that metformin in pregnant women with PCOS has not been shown to prevent: Gestational diabetes. Late miscarriage (12 weeks\u2009+\u20091 day to 21 weeks\u2009+\u20096 days gestational age). Hypertension in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia. Macrosomia or birthweight \u2265 4000 g.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          4.11.2  EBR  Metformin could be considered in some circumstances (e.g., risk for preterm birth) to reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain, in pregnant women with PCOS.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          4.11.3  PP  Women should be counselled that the consequences of metformin exposure on long-term offspring health remain unclear and there is a suggestion of increased childhood weight, although causality is not certain.          4.11.4  PP  Side effects of metformin are mostly mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms and are not worse in pregnancy.      5     Assessment and treatment of infertility              General principles            PP  All fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2).           PP  Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance.           PP  Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care.           PP  Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy.           PP  The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries. Where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects.           PP  There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.           5.1     Preconception risk factors           5.1.1  EBR  Women with PCOS should be counselled on the adverse impact of excess weight on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates, following infertility treatment.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          5.1.2  CR  Consistent with routine preconception care, in women with PCOS planning pregnancy, weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet and nutritional status, folate supplementation (higher dose in those with BMI >30 kg/m 2 ), exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health should be considered and optimized to improve reproductive and pregnancy outcomes and overall health.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756         5.1.3  PP  A reproductive life plan and age-appropriate education on optimizing reproductive health is recommended in adolescents and women with PCOS, including healthy lifestyle, prevention of excess weight gain, and optimizing preconception risk factors.          5.1.4  PP  Healthcare professionals are encouraged to seek permission and, if given, to assess weight and BMI and initiate a dialogue on the importance of weight and lifestyle on women's health before pregnancy. This requires caution to avoid weight stigma and needs to consider the cultural, social, and environmental determinants of health (see 3.6).          5.1.5  PP  Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions, should be optimally managed and women should be counselled regarding the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.           5.2     Tubal patency testing           5.2.1  CR  In women with PCOS and infertility due to anovulation alone with normal semen analysis, the risks, benefits, costs and timing and techniques of tubal patency testing in relation to the cost and complexity of the treatment, should be considered on an individual basis, depending on personal history and population prevalence, prior to starting ovulation induction with timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination.  \u2756\u2756\u2756          5.3     Letrozole           5.3.1  EBR  Letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS, with no other infertility factors.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295          5.3.2  PP   The use of letrozole is still off- label in many countries.  Where it is not allowed, clinicians could use other ovulation induction agents.           5.3.3  PP  Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pre-existing pregnancy, though there is no evidence for increased teratogenicity compared to other ovulation induction agents.           5.4     Clomiphene citrate and metformin            5.4.1     Metformin versus placebo           5.4.1.1  EBR  Metformin could be used alone, in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors, to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, whilst informing women that there are more effective ovulation agents.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef     5.4.1.2  PP  Women should be counselled as to potential mild gastrointestinal side-effects with metformin.          5.4.1.3  PP  Healthcare and resource burden including monitoring, travel and costs are lower with metformin.          5.4.1.4  PP  Consideration of age and screening for other fertility factors needs to be discussed before prescribing metformin.           5.4.2     Clomiphene citrate verses metformin           5.4.2.1  EBR  Clomiphene citrate could be used in preference to metformin in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors, to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.4.2.2  PP  The risk of multiple pregnancy is increased with clomiphene citrate use (alone or in combination with metformin) and therefore clomiphene cycles may require ultrasound monitoring.           5.4.3     Clomiphene citrate and metformin verses clomiphene citrate alone           5.4.3.1  EBR  Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than clomiphene citrate alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef           5.4.4     Clomiphene citrate and metformin versus metformin alone           5.4.4.1  EBR  Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin could be used rather than metformin alone in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve live birth rates.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.4.4.2  PP  Monitoring of combined cycles will need to be equivalent to clomiphene citrate alone.           5.4.5     Clomiphene citrate versus Letrozole           5.4.5.1  EBR  Letrozole should be used rather than clomiphene citrate in women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.   \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          5.4.5.2  PP  Current evidence demonstrates no difference in fetal abnormality rates between letrozole or clomiphene citrate ovulation induction or natural conception.           5.5     Gonadotrophins           5.5.1  EBR  Gonadotrophins alone could be considered rather than clomiphene citrate in therapy na\u00efve women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates (refer to PP 5.5.6).   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.5.2  EBR  Gonadotrophins alone could be used over gonadotrophins combined with clomiphene citrate in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile with clomiphene citrate resistance or failure, and no other infertility factors.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.5.3  EBR  Gonadotrophins could be considered rather than the combination of clomiphene citrate and metformin in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate-resistance and no other infertility factors.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          5.5.4  EBR  Either gonadotrophins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be used in women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate-resistance and no other infertility factors, following counselling on higher live birth rate and higher multiple pregnancy rates with gonadotrophins.   \u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.5.5  EBR  Gonadotrophins could be second-line pharmacological therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with no other infertility factors and who have failed first line oral ovulation induction.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.5.6  PP  Where gonadotrophins are to be prescribed, the following should be considered: Cost of the intervention for ovulation induction. Expertise required for the use of the intervention for ovulation induction. The degree of intensive ultrasound monitoring that is required. A low dose step-up gonadotrophin protocol should be used to optimize the chance of monofollicular development. Implications of potential multiple pregnancy.          5.5.7  PP  There appears to be no difference in the clinical efficacy of the available gonadotrophin preparations.          5.5.8  PP  When using gonadotrophins, best clinical practice is to avoid multiple pregnancy. Considerations here include cancelling cycles when there is more than a total of two follicles greater than 14mm in diameter and advising avoidance of unprotected intercourse.     5.5.9  PP  Live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate per patient and ovulation rate per cycle are higher with gonadotrophins than with clomiphene citrate.          5.5.10  PP  A low dose gonadotrophin protocol should be used to optimize the chance of monofollicular growth and minimize multiple pregnancy.          5.5.11  PP  Cycle monitoring and drug costs coupled with multiple injection will influence choice in gonadotrophin use.           5.6     Laparoscopic ovarian surgery           5.6.1  EBR  Laparoscopic ovarian surgery could be second-line therapy for women with PCOS who are anovulatory and infertile, with clomiphene citrate resistance and no other infertility factors.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.6.2  PP  When using laparoscopic ovarian surgery, the following should be considered: Comparative cost of the intervention for ovulation induction. Expertise required for the safe use of the intervention for ovulation induction. Both intraoperative and postoperative risks, which are higher in women who are above healthy weight.           5.7      In vitro fertilization and in vitro maturation           5.7.0.1  CR  In the absence of an absolute indication for in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), IVF could be offered in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, if first- or second-line ovulation induction therapies have failed.  \u2756\u2756\u2756         5.7.0.2  PP  In women with anovulatory PCOS, the use of IVF is effective and when elective single embryo transfer is used, multiple pregnancies can be minimized.          5.7.0.3  PP  Women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment should be counselled prior to starting treatment about the increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and options to reduce the risk should be offered.           5.7.1     Gonadotrophin releasing hormone protocol           5.7.1.1  PP  Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol cannot be recommended over GnRH agonist long protocol for women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI to improve clinical pregnancy or live birth rate.          5.7.1.2  PP  The use of a GnRH antagonist protocol for women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI is recommended as it enables the use of an agonist trigger, with the freezing of all embryos generated if required, without compromising the cumulative live birth rate, to reduce the risk of significant ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.           5.7.2     Trigger type           5.7.2.1  CR  Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist and freezing all suitable embryos is recommended, in an IVF/ICSI cycle with a GnRH antagonist protocol, where a fresh embryo transfer is not intended or where there is an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.  \u2756\u2756\u2756\u2756          5.7.3     Choice of follicle stimulating hormone           5.7.3.1  CR  Either urinary or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) could be used in women with PCOS undergoing (controlled) ovarian (hyper) stimulation for IVF/ICSI, with insufficient evidence to recommend a particular type of FSH preparation.  \u2756\u2756\u2756          5.7.4     Exogenous luteinising hormone           5.7.4.1  CR  Exogenous recombinant luteinising hormone (LH) treatment should not be routinely used in combination with FSH therapy in women with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ ICSI.  \u2756          5.7.5     Adjunct metformin           5.7.5.1  EBR  Adjunct metformin therapy could be used before and/or during FSH ovarian stimulation in women with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment with GnRH agonist long protocol, to reduce the risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and miscarriage.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef          5.7.5.2  PP  Good practice in PCOS and IVF is the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol as it gives the flexibility of using a GnRH agonist trigger, freeze all strategy to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, if using a GnRH agonist long protocol then metformin could be considered. If using metformin, the following could be considered: Commence metformin at the start of GnRH agonist treatment. Gradually titrate metformin up to a dose of between 1000mg to 2500mg daily in order to minimize side effects. Stopping metformin therapy at the time of the pregnancy test or period, unless the metformin therapy is otherwise indicated.      5.7.6      In vitro maturation           5.7.6.1  EBR  The use of in vitro maturation (IVM) and ICSI could be considered in women with PCOS as an alternative to a stimulated IVF/ICSI cycle, where an embryo is frozen and replaced in a subsequent embryo transfer cycle, acknowledging there is no risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but a lower cumulative live birth rate.   \u2756\u2756 \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef          5.7.6.2  CR  The use of IVM and ICSI could be considered prior to stimulated IVF/ ICSI cycles acknowledging both benefits and limitations.  \u2756\u2756         5.7.6.3  PP  IVM should only be considered in services with sufficient expertise, and advocacy is needed for regional or national centres of expertise.          5.7.6.4  PP  IVM could be offered as an option in women with prior severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and where the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is deemed unacceptably high, provided that expertise in IVM techniques exists.          5.7.6.5  PP  Evidence suggests that IVM/ICSI is less effective than standard IVF/ICSI in terms of clinical pregnancy per patient and live birth rate per patient.           5.8     Inositol           5.8.1  EBR  Inositol in any form alone, or in combination with other therapies, should be considered experimental therapy in women with PCOS with infertility, with benefits and risks currently too uncertain to recommend the use of these agents as fertility therapies.   \u2756\u2756\u2756 \u2295\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef          5.8.2  PP  There is limited evidence with uncertain results, on the effect of inositol on ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.          5.8.3  PP  Side effects and safety are not known for inositol.          5.8.4  PP  Women need to be aware that these agents can have limited regulation with variable dose, quality, consistency, and combination with other agents.          5.8.5  PP  Women\u2019s personal goals and preferences should be considered when discussing complimentary therapies.           5.9     Anti-obesity pharmacological agents           5.9.1  CR  We recommend using anti-obesity agents in PCOS for reproductive outcomes only in research settings to establish efficacy and safety."
