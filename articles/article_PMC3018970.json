    "body": "Introduction  PCOS is one of the most frequent endocrinopathies in the reproductive age years, with a prevalence of 5\u201310%[ 1 , 2 ]. At the same time, PCOS is the most frequent cause of hyperandrogenism\nand anovulatory related infertility. Although it was initially described by Stein an Leventhal in 1935, as a reproductive disorder characterized\nby polycystic ovaries, menstrual abnormalities, infertility and obesity, the studies of the last thirty years have demonstrated that PCOS is a\ndisorder associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Nowadays it is believed that\ninsulin resistance is the cause for this increased risk. Insulin resistance is a common finding in PCOS patients, with an important role in its\npathogenesis. Considering that insulin resistance and secondary hyperinsulinemia are involved in the occurrence of clinical and paraclinical features\nof PCOS, many authors have studied the efficiency of insulin resistance reduction strategies in the PCOS treatment.    PCOS Diagnosis  The criteria used for PCOS diagnosis have changed in time. Until 2003, the PCOS diagnosis was based on criteria established by the National Institute \nof Health (NIH) Conference in 1990: clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism associated with chronic anovulation. Exclusion of other ovarian, \nadrenal, thyroid and pituitary disorders are necessary for supporting the diagnosis. In 2003, the International Conference held in Rotterdam includes \nthe polycystic aspect of the ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound as a diagnostic criterion along with hyperandrogenism and oligo\u2013anovulation, recommending that PCOS diagnosis should be established if two out of the three criteria were present. Thus, polycystic ovaries are considered \na diagnostic criterion, although some authors consider this not to be specific [ 3 ] because it can also be found in patients without hyperandrogenism \nand anovulation [ 3 , 4 ]. After the Rotterdam criteria were introduced, two new \nPCOS phenotypes have been described besides the classic one: patients with polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism and ovulatory cycles (ovulatory \nphenotype), and patients with polycystic ovaries and anovulation, but without hyperandrogenism. Studying these subtypes of patients, it has been observed \nthat patients with the ovulatory phenotype have less insulin resistance than the classic phenotype ( 5 ), and \nthose without hyperandrogenism have no insulin resistance [ 6 ]. In these subtypes the involvement of insulin \nresistance in the pathogenesis may be less important. This is why the use of Rotterdam criteria may produce confusions when patients other then belonging \nto the classic phenotype are introduced in clinical studies referring to insulin resistance or metabolic abnormalities. Taking in consideration these \naspects, Androgen Excess Society (AES) defines PCOS as a disorder in which androgen excess is defining and recommends to be included in PCOS category \nonly patients with hyperandrogenism. The data available till now about the involvement of insulin resistance and high risk for metabolic abnormalities \nderive from studies that have included mainly patients with the classic phenotype.    Insulin resistance in PCOS  The association between insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism has been reported for the first time in 1921, when Achard and Thiers have \ndescribed \u2018diabetes des femmes a barbe\u2019 [ 7 ]. Nowadays, the relationship between the two conditions is \nwell documented, especialy based on studies showing that PCOS patients have insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Although insulin \nresistance is considered an intrinsec feature of the syndrome, independent of body weight, obesity, a frequent feature \n[ 8 ] among PCOS patients (60\u201370%), has a major contribution to the aggravation of the insulin \nresistance. Insulin resistance was also reported in lean PCOS patients, but its prevalence was variable and some studies even failed to find it. \nNowadays, PCOS is considered a disease with a complex and heterogeneous pathogenesis, different mechanisms being involved in different ratios in \nthe appearance of the syndrome. Therefore in certain patients, insulin resistance may be less involved in the pathogenesis.  The etiology of insulin resistance in PCOS, although intensely studied, is not completely cleared up. The mechanisms most probably involved are defects \nat the post receptor level. Thus, in 50% of the patients autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR), which inhibits the intrinsic tyrosine\u2013kinase activity of the IR, has been described [ 9 ]. Another post receptor anomaly has been described in the muscle \ncells of the PCOS patients. This consists in the decrease of the insulin\u2013mediated phosphatidylinositol\u20133\u2013kinase activity associated \nto IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), involved in the glucose tapping and carbohydrate metabolism ( 10 ). Regarding \nthe existence of other IR anomalies, it is possible that a small number of IR in adipocytes to be involved in the insulin resistance of PCOS, the \nhypothesis being related in several studies. In exchange, the decrease of insulin affinity for its receptors is not considered to have major implications \nin PCOS pathogenesis.  It is well known that the abdominal and visceral adiposity is associated with insulin resistance. In PCOS patients an android disposition of adipose \ntissue has been described in the obese patients, as well as in the normal weight patients. Moreover, lean PCOS have much more adipose tissue than the \nnormal weight controls. These anthropometric characteristics may contribute to the PCOS insulin resistance. The particular disposition of adipose tissue \nin PCOS could be explained by lipolysis anomalies similar to that found in the patients with android obesity and could be explained by a decreased density \nof beta2 adrenergic receptors and hormone\u2013sensible lipase activity.  Reduced fetal growth could be another possible mechanism of PCOS insulin resistance. This has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for metabolic \nand cardiovascular complications in the adult life, presumably due to its association with insulin resistance. Furthermore, it has been shown that \nreduced fetal growth predisposes to hyperinsulinemia, anovulation and ovarian hyperandrogenism in patients with premature pubarche \n[ 11 ]. These data suggest that postpubertal appearance of the typical PCOS manifestations may be antenatal \nconditioned, with the possible contribution of the environmental and genetic factors.  The involvement of insulin resistance and secondary hyperinsulinemia in the PCOS pathogenesis is complex, implying the existence of many mechanisms. \nIn vivo and in vitro studies have proved that insulin directly stimulates ovarian streroidogenesis at the level of theca cells, along with LH. \nThis co\u2013gonadotropic effect contributes to the PCOS hyperandrogenism. Furthermore insulin decreases the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels \nby decreasing the liver synthesis, raising the level of free testosterone. Also, it decreases the IGFBP1 liver synthesis and so it increases \nIGF1 biodisponibility in the ovaries, causing increased production of ovarian androgens through its co\u2013gonadotropic effect. In 50% of the \nPCOS patients, the adrenal androgens have an important contribution in the appearance of hyperandrogenism, the involvement of hyperinsulinemia in \nthe alteration of the adrenal steroid genesis being demonstrated [ 12 ]. Although experimental studies suggested \nthe contribution of hyperinsulinemia to the characteristic changes of gonadotrop secretion in PCOS, the clinical studies didn't succeed to offer \nsolid evidence [ 13 ].  Recently, it has been demonstrated that insulin action in the ovaries is mediated by inositolglycan at the post receptor level, and not \nby tyrosine\u2013kinase cascade. This is how we explain why the insulin resistance, through IR autophosphorylation, in other tissues doesn't \nimpede the insulin effects in the ovaries [ 14 ].  These mechanisms through which insulin resistance contributes to the appearance of clinical and paraclinical changes in PCOS are mostly demonstrated by \nin vitro studies. In vivo studies have tried to reproduce these mechanisms by acute administration of insulin, but they obtained contradictory results. Of \nthe clinical studies, the most convincing have been those that proved the amelioration of the clinical and paraclinical parameters by decreasing the \ninsulin resistance, thus supporting its pathogenic role.    Infertility in PCOS  Infertility is frequently met in PCOS patients, with a prevalence of 74%[ 15 ], and in 40% of cases it \nis actually the motive of presentation to the doctor[ 16 ]. Infertility is the consequence of chronic anovulation, \nbeing usually accompanied by menstrual abnormalities: dysfunctional uterine bleeding, oligomenhorrea, amenorrhea. The presence of regular menstrual \nbleeding doesn't exclude anovulation. Twenty one per cent of the patients with hyperandrogenism have regular menstrual cycles that are \nanovulatory [ 17 ]. Furthermore PCOS patients that get pregnant spontaneously or after ovulation induction \ntreatments have more frequently pregnancy associated pathology. So, these patients have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. The exact mechanism \nthat would explain this complication is still a matter of debate, both hyperandrogenism and obesity being incriminated as major causes. There are \nstudies that show an increased prevalence of gestational diabetes (40\u201346%) [ 18 ] and pregnancy \ninduced hypertension (28,5%) [ 19 ] and have proved the association between insulin resistance and \nthese pregnancy complications [ 18 ].  The exact mechanism that determines the chronic anovulation in PCOS has been deeply studied, but in spite of all the studies conducted till now, \nwe don't have a complete understanding of all the components implicated in this process. The hystologic studies performed in the PCOS patients \nhave shown ovarian follicles arrested in evolution in the antral stage, containing degenerate granulosa cells. Based on these initial studies it has \nbeen thought that the big number of ovarian follicles found in PCOS are atretic. But subsequent studies demonstrated that the PCOS follicles are viable \nand functional, preserving the capacity of steroidogenesis [ 20 ]. Furthermore the granulosa cells of PCOS patients \nhave an increased sensibility to FSH stimulation, proving once more their viability. Although some authors affirm that the increased ovarian androgens \nlevel induces follicular atresia and incapacity of selection of a dominant follicle [ 21 ], there are numerous \nproves that contradict this hypothesis. Studies made on animals have shown that testosterone administration raises the number of normal preantral and \nantral follicles [ 22 ]; in these follicles testosterone increases the mARN of the androgenic receptors in the \ngranulosa cells, determining their own proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [ 23 ]. Furthermore \ntestosterone increases the mARN of the FSH receptor in the granulosa cells [ 24 ]. All these support the role \nof androgens in increasing the number of small but functional follicles, pointing to hyperandrogenism as the main factor to induce the ovarian changes \nin PCOS.  The increased sensibility of the granulosa cells to FSH and the big number of viable follicles determine constant levels of estradiol and inhibin, \nwith the loss of physiologic variations of the estradiol levels that permit the FSH and LH peak, leading to anovulation. Hyperinsulinemia \nindirectly contributes to anovulation, through hyperandrogenism, but may have a direct role, by stimulating the production of estradiol the same as FSH.    Strategies of reducing insulin resistance in PCOS  Since there are numerous evidences of the involvement of insulin resistance in the PCOS pathogenesis, strategies of insulin resistance reduction have \nbeen studied in the treatment of this syndrome. The utility of insulin resistance reduction has been initially suggested by the studies that followed\nthe effect of loosing weight in obese PCOS patients. Afterward, there were studies about the use of insulin sensitizing drugs in PCOS. First such a\nreport was given in 1994, by Velazquez, who observed the decrease of the free androgens and an improvement of the menstrual abnormalities in the\npatients that have received Metformin [ 25 ]. In the majority of studies, the favorable effects on the endocrine\nand reproductive anomalies have been accompanied by the reduction of the insulin resistance, supporting its etiologic involvement.  Weight loss has been studied by many authors, all of them reporting the improvement of hyperinsulinemia \nand hyperandrogenism, simultaneously with the recovery of normal menstrual cycles and the appearance of spontaneous pregnancies in 30% of the \npatients [ 26 ]. These fortunate effects were observed even with a modest weight loss of 2\u20135%\n[ 27 ]. Because of the association between obesity and increased risk for spontaneous abortion, the weight loss\ncould have a positive effect on the outcome of the pregnancy, although this aspect hasn't been particularly studied in PCOS. In obese\npatients, weight loss is associated with the improvement of the lipid and cardiovascular parameters, with benefits in the long run. Also considering\nthe good effects upon the fertility, weight loss must be recommended to all obese patients with PCOS as an adjoin to any chosen therapy.  Metformin was the first insulin sensitizing drug to be given to the PCOS patients, initially with the purpose of \nobtaining additional arguments regarding the involvement of insulin resistance in the PCOS pathogenesis. Although the study conducted by Velasquez in \n1994 proved the efficiency of Metformin in the improvement of the endocrine status at the same time with the insulin resistance reduction, the \nparallel weight loss of the patients could have been a source of error. But the subsequent studies have demonstrated that the Metformin effects \nare independent of the weight variations [ 28 , 29 ]. Administered to the \nPCOS patients, Metformin may improve the menstrual disorders and anovulation in 50% of the studied patients, with increased probability of response \nin the patients with hyperinsulinemia, less severe menstrual disorders and a lower level of free testosterone [ 28 ]\n. Thus, it has been speculated upon the fact that Metformin is efficient in the category of patients in which the insulin resistance has an important role \nin pathogenesis. Not all the studies have succeeded in proving the efficiency of Metformin in PCOS patients regarding the decrease of hyperinsulinemia \nand hyperandrogenism [ 30 , 31 ]. The explanation could be the severe obesity \nof the patients in those studies, being well known that an important weight loss is necessary to decrease the insulin resistance in severely obese \npatients. Because only 50% of the PCOS patients respond to Metformin, the proportion of these patients in the studied group could influence the \nfinal results. Furthermore, it has been proven that you have to give 2,550mg/day to lower the insulin resistance in the obese women, doses like 1,500 \nmg having no effect [ 32 ]. Nevertheless, most of the studies have used 1,500 to 1,700 mg/day.  Now, there are studies that prove that Metformin has positive results in the normoponderal patients with PCOS, showing a higher efficiency when \ncomparing to the supraponderal and obese patients ( 33 ).  Clomiphene citrate is the classic therapy used in the induction of ovulation, being successful in 75% of the cases. The rest of 25%\nare considered resistant to Clomiphene and are usually more obese with a higher insulin resistance. The administration of Metformin before Clomiphene,\nin the PCOS patients, has shown a significant increase of ovulation and pregnancy rates when compared to placebo\n[ 34 , 35 ]. There is a well known association between insulin resistance and\nthe risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; when Metformin is administered in association with the gonadotrops, a smaller number of follicles,\nlower levels of estradiol and higher number of fertilizations and pregnancies are observed [ 36 ].  In the PCOS patients that become pregnant there is a high risk of complications, like spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes. Administered \nin pregnancy, it has been proved that Metformin lowers the risk of these complications. The effect may be due to the decrease in insulin resistance \nand hyperandrogenism, but also to other mechanisms: the normalization of the PAI activity and the modulation of the immune response of the \nendometrium (reflected by the high levels of glycodelin induced by Metformin) [ 37 ]. The safety of giving \nMetformin during pregnancy hasn't been proved, being categorized as B drug. Thus, the benefits of Metformin in pregnancy must be confirmed \nby extensive studies, after its safety has been proved.  Because most of the Metformin studies are small and have no control group, metaanalyses of the randomized controlled trials have been made. A \nrecent metaanalysis (April 2008) that took in consideration 17 studies with a total of 1,639 patients confirmed the efficiency of Metformin in the \novulation induction, compared with placebo, especially in women without resistance to Clomiphene ( 38 ). At the \nsame time, the association of Metformin and Clomiphene is superior to Clomiphene alone in ovulation induction and obtaining the pregnancy, especially in \nthe obese women or resistant to Clomiphene ( 38 ). But to estimate the value of an infertility treatment the \nmost important is the final result: the birth of a live neonate. Very few studies had as an objective this parameter. Recently two big, randomized \nstudies that followed the efficiency of Metformin in increasing the number of live neonates have been published. The first study, done on approximately \n100 normoponderal PCOS patients, observed a similar efficiency of Metformin and Clomiphene in inducing ovulation, but superior results in obtaining \nthe pregnancy for Metformin [ 39 ]. The subsequent pursuit of these patients has shown a bigger number of live \nneonates in the group treated with Metformin. The second study comprised 600 patients (200 patients per each study group) and compared the efficiency \nof Metformin and Clomiphene administered separately and in association. Although a superior efficiency in ovulation induction has been observed in \nthe patients that receives the combined treatment, this wasn't followed by a significantly bigger number of live neonates \n[ 40 ]. An explanation for the difference between the results of the two studies may be given by the high percentage \nof obese patients in the second study (aprox. 70%), being known the high risk of spontaneous abortion caused by the obesity alone. In these \nstudies, the Metformin administration has been stopped the moment the pregnancy was obtained, so the possible effect of abortion reduction (reported \nin previous studies) that could have improved the outcome of the pregnancy could not be studied.  Thiazolidindiones After clinical studies have demonstrated the efficiency of Metformin in the amelioration of the \nendocrine and reproductive parameters, it has been tried to study other insulin sensitizing drugs in the treatment of PCOS. In 2001, Azziz reported \nthe results of a multicentre study on 410 PCOS patients ( 41 ) who received Troglitazone in doses of 150, 300 \nand 600mg/day for 44 weeks. It has been observed the improvement of the hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism, the menstrual abnormalities and anovulation in \na dose\u2013dependent manner. The patients that responded to the treatment were less obese, with less severe menstrual abnormalities, hyperinsulinism \nand hyperandrogenism. In 2000, Troglitazone was withdrawn from use due to the severe liver adverse reactions. Thus, the utility of the new \nthiazolidindiones (Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone) is now evaluated in PCOS patients. Rosiglitazone in 4mg/day dose \n[ 42 ] or Pioglitazone 30mg/day dose [ 43 ] were proved to reduce the \ninsulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in PCOS patients, as well as restoring the ovulation and the regular menstrual cycles. In normoponderal \nPCOS patients, the clinical and paraclinical amelioration was obtained with 2 mg/day of Rosiglitazone, as well as with 4 mg/day, with a greater effect of \nthe bigger dose [ 44 ]. Rosiglitazone, in doses of 4mg/day, determined clinical and paraclinical improvement in \nobese patients with increased insulin resistance considered less responsive to Metformin [ 45 ]. It was suggested \nthat Rosiglitazone could represent an alternative to the treatment of obese patients with high insulin resistance when Metformin is not efficient. \nSimilar studies have shown that Rosiglitazone (8mg/day), as well as Pioglitazone (30mg/day), have superior results in the amelioration of insulin \nresistance and hyperandrogenism, in the supraponderal and obese PCOS patients, when compared to Metformin (2,000\u20132,550 mg/day) \n[ 46 , 47 ]. Furthermore, in patients resistant to Clomiphene, the association \nwith Rosiglitazone proved to have better outcome then Metformin association in ovulation induction, although there was no significant difference in \nthe pregnancy number between the two groups [ 48 ]. Unlike Metformin that produces weight loss, \nthiazolidindiones don't have this favorable effect, but most studies have shown a decrease in the waist/hip ratio because of the fat \nredistribution process induced by thiazolidindiones, with possible modification of the insulin resistance. These arguments of the thiazolidindiones \nefficacy in the treatment of PCOS come from studies made with a small number of patients that is why they must be confirmed by bigger randomized \nstudies. Relying on a metaanalysis, it has been recently suggested that Rosiglitazone might be associated with an increased risk of coronary events, \nbut later studies didn't confirm this suspicion. It can't be overlooked that thiazolidindiones are placed in the C category \nregarding pregnancy, because animal studies have shown a delay in the fetal development. That is why when you intend ovulation induction, this \ndrug administration must be made with precaution and stopped when pregnancy appears.    Conclusions  Insulin resistance involvement in PCOS pathogenesis is clearly supported by in vivo and in vitro studies, the most convincing being those that \ninvolve insulin resistance reduction strategies. The insulin sensitizing drugs have induced in most of the studies, the improvement of the endocrine \nand reproductive parameters simultaneously with the amelioration of the insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, suggesting this to be the main \nbeneficial mechanism in PCOS. Data available today support the efficacy of Metformin in ovulation induction, and its' association with Clomiphene \nincreases the rate of ovulation and pregnancies in PCOS patients resistant to Clomiphene. The favorable effects of Metformin are not universal, but vary \nwith PCOS subtype, patients with a higher insulin resistance having a better response. At the same time, presence of severe obesity may limit the efficacy \nof Metformin treatment. In these situations, the thiazolidindiones could be a therapeutic alternative. Considering all these data, there is \ncontroversy regarding the final aim represented by the increase in the number of live neonates, in part because of the small number of studies. While \nthis effect was described in the normal weight patients, in the supraponderal and obese PCOS patients this effect was not reported. This fact may be due \nto the discontinuance of Metformin treatment at the beginning of the pregnancy and with this the possible effect of spontaneous abortion reduction. \nWeight loss associated with Metformin treatment might improve the pregnancy outcome and must be recommended to all supraponderal and obese PCOS \npatients. More studies are needed to establish exactly the categories of patients that respond to the insulin sensitizing drugs to increase the efficiency \nof the therapeutic strategies. Also, it must be evaluated the safety of Metformin use during pregnancy and the possible implications in the increase of \nthe live neonates number.",
