    "body": "Research in context    Evidence before this study  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition characterized by oligo/anovulation, high androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries. The ovulatory dysfunction mechanisms underlying PCOS are not completely understood. Ovulation is a complicated process that is influenced by multiple factors. One of the essential transcriptional regulators that impact the ovulation process is CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2). ChIP-seq data have hinted that erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (EPH) A7 (EPHA7) may be closely related to C/EBP\u03b2 in PCOS. The EPH receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their ephrin (EFN) ligands are crucial for cell signaling pathways linked to various biological outcomes. EPH signaling plays a role in multiple physiological functions involving nervous system development, angiogenesis, insulin secretion, immunity, etc. In addition, EPH signaling influences the activities of integrins and intercellular adhesion molecules that lead to control of cell morphology, adhesion, migration and invasion. Ovulation involves COC expansion and follicular rupture; while the follicular rupture and the formation of CL involve cell adhesion and angiogenesis. Some members of the EPH-EFN family (EPHA2/A4/A7 and EFNA4/B1/B2) have been found to be strongly expressed in human luteinizing GCs. EFNA5 is considered as the ligand of EPHA7, and it is noteworthy that Efna5 \u2212/\u2212 female mice produce smaller litters and release fewer oocytes than controls. Hence, EPHA7 is probably related to ovulation. To our knowledge, no study has provided evidence that demonstrates a role for EPHA7 in female fertility and PCOS. The correlation between EPHA7 and ovulation remains unclear and needs to be investigated.    Added value of this study  Our study firstly demonstrates the role of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (EPH) A7 (EPHA7) in the pathogenesis of anovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). EPHA7 functions as a critically positive upstream factor for the expression of ERK1/2-mediated C/EBP\u03b2. This protein, in turn, induced transcription and translation of KLF4 and then facilitated the expression of ADAMTS1. Low expression of EPHA7 and EPHA7-regulated pathway factors in human granulosa cells is considered to contribute to PCOS. We performed in vitro experiments in KGN cells to verify the molecular mechanisms and conducted in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies in rats to identify the ovulatory effect of EPHA7. A 1-week functional EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus in rat ovaries contributed to decreased numbers of retrieved oocytes, and a 3-week functional lentivirus led to menstrual disorders and morphological polycystic changes in rat ovaries. Moreover, we found that EPHA7 triggered ovulation in rats inducing the increase of luteinizing hormone (LH), and it improved polycystic ovarian changes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in PCOS rats. Also we confirmed the safety of exogenous EPHA7 injection in rats.    Implications of all the available evidence  Our findings illustrate a new role of EPHA7 in PCOS, suggesting that EPHA7 is an effective and potential target for the development of innovative medicines to induce ovulation and for assisted reproductive treatments. Given the other previous reports, the EPH-EFN family might play a crucial role in female fertility. More experiments about EPH-EFN family members in various animals and clinical trials will be required in the future.    Alt-text: Unlabelled Box      1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition characterized by oligo/anovulation, high androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries. It affects at least 10% of females and has become the most common syndrome affecting not only reproduction but also metabolism [ 1 ]. High androgen levels and insulin resistance result in metabolic and hormonal dysfunctions in PCOS patients [ 2 ]. However, anovulation and menstrual cycle abnormalities are usually the frequent symptoms troubling women of reproductive age. The hyper response of follicles to gonadotropins is thought to induce premature follicles to produce a transient high concentration of circulating estradiol [ 3 ]. Subsequently, higher estradiol suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through negative feedback, leading to abnormal follicle maturation which contributes to the observed disrupted ovulation [ 3 ]. Irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation can cause infertility. A Finnish study shows that PCOS leads to difficulty in conception [ 4 ]. Therefore, anovulation affects many women of reproductive age with PCOS and remains a common problem.  Ovulation is triggered by a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge; it results in the release of a mature fertilizable oocyte and formation of corpus luteum (CL) [ 5 ]. The LH surge triggers the maturation of follicles and ovulation by activating multiple signaling pathways in granulosa cells (GCs), including the cAMP/protein kinase A [ 6 ] pathway, p38MAPK\u03b1 (MAPK14), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling cascades [ 5 , 7 ]. The ERK1/2 cascade plays vital roles in ovulation such as cumulus cell\u2013oocyte complex (COC) expansion, oocyte maturation, and follicle rupture [ [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] ]. Proteinases exert changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) to allow the expansion of COC and degradation of the apical follicular walls. Among the different proteinases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) is thought to be crucial for ovulation and fertilization [ 12 , 13 ].  Ovulation is a complicated process that is influenced by multiple factors. The transcriptional regulators that impact the ovulation process include the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) [ 5 , 8 ], progesterone receptor (PGR) [ 14 ], and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH1) [ 15 , 16 ], among others. C/EBP\u03b2, a member of the basic leucine zipper proteins, regulates ovulation and is important for reproduction [ 5 , 8 ]. The translation of C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA gives rise to three isoforms: LAP1, LAP2, and LIP [ 17 ]. LAP1 and LAP2 are mostly transcriptional activators, whereas LIP acts as a repressor. In preovulatory follicles, expression of C/EBP\u03b2 is increased by LH and activated in an ERK1/2-dependent manner [ 8 ]. Female C/ebp\u03b2 gc \u2212/\u2212 mice are subfertile, and C/ebpa/\u03b2 gc \u2212/\u2212 double-mutant are sterile with follicles failing to ovulate and ovaries lacking CL [ 5 ]. Moreover, C/EBP\u03b2 contributes to the differentiation and maturation of GCs as well as to progesterone production through steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) [ 18 ]. Therefore, C/EBP\u03b2 plays essential roles in ovulation, steroidogenesis, and female reproduction.  C/EBP\u03b2 is a transcription factor contributing to the regulation of numerous target genes involved in the formation and maintenance of corpora lutea, steroidogenesis, and vascularization of ruptured follicles [ 5 ]. ChIP-seq data have hinted that erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (EPH) A7 (EPHA7) may be closely related to C/EBP\u03b2 in PCOS [ [19] , [20] , [21] ]. The EPH receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their ephrin (EFN) ligands are crucial for cell signaling pathways linked to various biological outcomes [ 22 ]. EPH signaling plays a role in multiple physiological functions involving nervous system development, angiogenesis, insulin secretion and immunity [ [23] , [24] , [25] ]. In addition, EPH signaling influences the activities of integrins and intercellular adhesion molecules that lead to control of cell morphology, adhesion, migration and invasion [ 26 , 27 ]. Ovulation involves COC expansion and follicular rupture; while the follicular rupture and the formation of CL involve cell adhesion and angiogenesis [ 28 ]. Some members of the EPH-EFN family (EPHA2/A4/A7 and EFNA4/B1/B2) have been found to be strongly expressed in human luteinizing GCs [ 29 , 30 ]. Interestingly, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is not a major determinant of EPH/EFN regulation in human granulosa cells (hGCs) [ 30 ]. Whereas FSH can increase the expression of EFNA5 and multiple EPH receptors in GCs of mice and rats, affecting their morphology and adhesion capabilities [ 31 ]. It is noteworthy that Efna5 \u2212/\u2212 female mice produce smaller litters and release fewer oocytes than controls [ 32 ]. Hence, the EPH-EFN family is probably related to ovulation and female fertility. To our knowledge, no study has provided evidence that demonstrates a role for EPHA7 in female reproduction and PCOS. The correlation between EPHA7 and ovulation if any remains unclear and needs to be investigated.  Anovulation affects many PCOS patients, and EPHA7 and other factors may be associated with this abnormality. This study was designed to assess the role of EPAH7 in ovulation in PCOS cases, and to find underlying molecular mechanisms. At the same time, based on our findings we tried to characterize a new feasible approach with EPHA7 for the treatment of anovulation in PCOS.    2  Materials and methods   2.1  Human subjects and granulosa cell samples  Participants were women recruited from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Appropriate informed consents were obtained from all patients in this study. Forty PCOS patients fulfilled all three of the Rotterdam criteria [ 1 ], and 32 non-PCOS patients were selected due to tubal factor infertility with regular menstrual cycles and normal ovarian morphologies. All subjects, 20\u201335\u202fyears old, were of Han ethnicity and did not undergo hormonal therapy for at least 3\u202fmonths before the study; all patients underwent a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol with hCG trigger. The clinical information of patients is presented in Table 1 . On the retrieval day, hGCs were recovered from the follicular fluid samples aspirated transvaginally from individual follicles under ultrasound guidance during the follicle puncture for IVF procedures. The GC isolation method was followed similar to that described previously using Ficoll-Paque\u2122 PLUS (GE-HealthCare Bio-Science, Uppsala, Sweden) and hyaluronidase (Sigma) [ 33 ]. The Institutional Review Board of the Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, reviewed and approved all procedures.

All rats were kept under a 12\u202fh light\u2013dark cycle at a temperature of 21\u202f\u00b0C\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C and with a humidity of 65%\u202f\u00b1\u202f5%; food and water were provided ad libitum. All experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.    2.3  Superovulation and sample collection  A total of 20 rats (5-week-old, 150\u202fg) were randomly divided into four groups: phosphate buffer saline (PBS), hCG, EPHA7 and hCG\u202f+\u202fEPHA7 groups. Each rat was intraperitoneally injected with 30\u202fIU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (Sansheng Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China) at 4\u202fp.m. to stimulate follicular development. About 48\u202fh later, control rats were given PBS while EPHA7 group rats were injected with Recombinant Mouse EPHA7-Fc Chimera Protein (0.03\u202fmg/kg BW) (R&D systems, MN, USA) through the caudal vein. Referring to the previous study [ 34 ] and considering normal rat serum EPHA7 level detected in the paper (about 3\u202fng/ml), we finally chose the dose of 0.03\u202fmg/kg BW. At the same time, hCG group rats were intraperitoneally given 30\u202fIU hCG (Sansheng) and hCG\u202f+\u202fEPHA7 group rats were treated with a combination of hCG (30\u202fIU) and EPHA7 (0.03\u202fmg/kg BW). We collected blood samples from the orbital veins of all rats before, and every 4\u202fh after, PBS, hCG, or EPHA7 injections. Sixteen hours later, all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. All blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 2500\u202frpm for 15\u202fmin to obtain serum samples that were stored at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C. Ovary samples were collected and stored at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for further experiments. Oviducts were removed and rinsed in M2 medium (Sigma). We tore open the ampulla of each rat to release cumulus masses and then treated those with hyaluronidase (Sigma) to separate oocytes under a stereoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The retrieved oocytes were carefully numbered and photographed using a microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).    2.4  Injection of shRNA lentivirus  The EPHA7 shRNA target sequence (5\u2032-CCGGTGAAAGAAAGATGAAGCTGAACTCGAGTTCAGCTTCATCTTTCTTTCATTTTTG-3\u2032) and the control shRNA target sequence (5\u2032-CCGGTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTTCAAGAGAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATTTTTG-3\u2032) were designed at the GeneChem Company (GeneChem, Shanghai, China). The shRNA lentivirus preparation protocol was modified slightly from the published method [ 35 ]. Briefly, since the lentiviral vector system included pGCL-GFP, pHelper 1.0, and pHelper 2.0, all three extracted plasmids were transfected into 293\u202fT cells to harvest the active virosomes. The virus titer used was 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 9 (TU/ml). We cut a small wound on the back of each rat (7-week-old, 200\u202fg), separated the ovary and then directly injected 10\u202f\u03bcl shRNA lentivirus into one ovary. The microsyringe needle was carefully held in place for several minutes after the injection. Finally, we sutured the muscle and skin layers. Since the lentiviral vector system included GFP, we fixed rat ovaries with 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Then the ovarian sections were directly visualized using a fluorescence microscope to determine the distribution and efficiency of lentiviral transfection. For one part of our study, 12 rats were induced to superovulate with 40\u202fIU PMSG (Sansheng) 1\u202fweek after the surgical procedure, and then with 40\u202fIU hCG (Sansheng) 48\u202fh after the PMSG to investigate the role of EPHA7 in the ovulatory process of rats. For the other part of the study, 10 rats were directly sacrificed 3\u202fweeks after the surgical procedure, to explore the long-term impact of EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus on rat ovaries.    2.5  Establishment of the PCOS rat model and EPHA7 injection  Four-week-old, female SD rats were injected daily (s.c.) with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (60\u202fmg/kg BW) (Langchem, Shanghai, China) for 20 consecutive days in the DHEA ( n =\u202f6) and in the DHEA+EPHA7 (n\u202f=\u202f6) groups. Instead, of DHEA, PBS was used in the control (n\u202f=\u202f6) and control+EPHA7 (n\u202f=\u202f6) groups according to a report [ 36 ]. Estrous cycles were detected during the last eight consecutive days of the rat model building, and the body weights were measured once a week. The successful PCOS rat models were confirmed according to published criteria [ 37 ]. Recombinant EPHA7-Fc Chimera Protein (0.03\u202fmg/kg BW) (R&D) was injected through the caudal veins at 4\u202fp.m. at 7\u202fweeks of age, once the PCOS rat model was considered successfully set up. All rats were sacrificed 16\u202fh later and samples were collected.    2.6  Glucose tolerance test (GTT)  After DHEA treatment for 20\u202fdays, female rats of control and DHEA groups were left to fast for 16\u202fh (5\u202fp.m. to 9\u202fa.m.). Then d -glucose (2\u202fg/kg BW) was intraperitoneally injected into each rat. The blood glucose level was measured before, and 30, 60, 90, and 120\u202fmin, after the d -glucose injection with an Accu-Chek glucose monitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).    2.7  Serum levels of hormones and EPHA7  The concentrations of LH, FSH, progesterone and EPHA7 in rat sera were detected using ELISA Kits for Rat Luteinizing Hormone (LH) (Mybiosource, San Diego, USA), Rat Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) (Biomatik, Canada), Rat Progesterone (PROG) (TSZ, San Francisco, USA) and Rat EPH receptor A7 (EPHA7) (Mybiosource). For the detection of the LH level we had to perform a 10-fold dilution of the rats' sera. All the procedures were carried out according to standard manufacturers' protocols.    2.8  Safety of EPHA7 injection into rats  Recombinant EPHA7-Fc Chimera Protein was injected into 7-week-old SD rats at a dose of 0.03\u202fmg/kg BW through the caudal vein, while PBS was used for controls. Each group had five rats; set up two groups treated with EPHA7 and one group was the control. After 48\u202fh, we recorded the rats' appearances, hair, activity levels, respiratory depths and rates, fecal matters, feeding habits, and local reactions at the injection sites on the tails. Then we collected the ovaries, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys of five rats injected with EPAH7 to detect any pathological changes on tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). After 14\u202fdays, we sacrificed another two groups, repeating this experiment. Meanwhile, we performed the blood routine examinations and measured blood biochemical indexes of the remaining 10 rats.    2.9  Histology and immunohistochemistry  Rat tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then embedded in paraffin. Five \u03bcm-thick tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Then the sections were stained in hematoxylin and differentiated by hydrochloric acid. Finally, the sections were incubated in eosin before covering the slides or visualization using a microscope (Zeiss). Total numbers of small antral follicles (oocyte surrounded by greater than five layers of granulosa cells and/or one or two small areas of follicular fluid), large antral follicles (containing a single large antrum) and corpora lutea (CL) were classified and quantified as previously reported [ 37 , 38 ]. To avoid repetitive counting, each follicle was only counted in the section where the oocyte's nucleolus was visible. The thickness of granulosa cell and theca cell layers was respectively measured using Image J software (version 1.48; NIH) ( n =\u202f6 per group, serial sections of each ovary were used for measurement). For immunohistochemistry, we blocked the ovarian sections with rabbit serum and then incubated them with EPHA7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (1:100) overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in a dark chamber, followed by incubation with secondary antibody. The color reaction was visualized by exposure to diaminobenzidine (DAB).    2.10  Cell culture  KGN cells (a human granular carcinoma cell line) were kindly provided by the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital. They were cultured in Phenol Red-free DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and incubated at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere, with 5% CO 2 . KGN cells were routinely subcultured every 2 or 3\u202fdays.    2.11  Transfection of small interfering (si) RNA with liposome  Transfections of siRNA were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. KGN cells (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 5 ) were plated onto six-well plates and cultured until they were 80% confluent. After refreshing the medium, we mixed Lipofectamine 3000 and siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) against target genes with Opti-MEM (Gibco) and then evenly added the mixture into each well. KGN cells were further incubated for 48\u202fh before detecting the efficiency of knockdown and the abundance of target genes. The specific sequences of target genes were as follows:  EPHA7 siRNA, 5\u2032-GGAUAACUAUGUCACUGUCTT-3\u2032;  C/EBP\u03b2 siRNA, 5\u2032-GCACCCUGCGGAACUUGUUTT-3\u2032;  KLF4 siRNA, 5\u2032-CCGAGGAGTTCAACGATCT-3\u2032;  nonspecific scrambled siRNA, 5\u2032-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3\u2032.    2.12  Transfection of plasmids with electroporation  KGN cells (6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 6 ) were mixed with 10\u202f\u03bcg pCMV3-C-Flag-EPHA7, pCMV3-C-Flag-KLF4 (Transheep, Shanghai, China) or LAP-overexpression plasmid (gift from the Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences), respectively, in Opti-MEM (Gibco). We added the mixture into 2-mm gap cuvettes. The cell suspensions were electroporated at 170\u202fV for 5\u202fms using a NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene). After diluting with DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS, KGN cells were transferred into a six-well plate and were prepared for the treatment after further incubation for 72\u202fh before detecting the efficiency of overexpression and abundance of target genes.    2.13  Real-time polymerase chain reaction  Total RNA was extracted from cells and rat ovaries specimens by using a total RNA kit (FOREGENE, Chengdu, China). RNA concentration and quality were determined by measuring optical density at 260\u202fnm (OD260) and OD260/OD280 ratio with a NanoDrop ND-2000. mRNA from total cellular RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT Master Mix Perfect Real-time kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Real-time polymerase chain reaction, also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR), was used to detect the abundance of target genes. The ratio of the target gene over \u03b2-ACTIN was calculated as the target mRNA level. The primer sequences used of targeting genes were as follows:  EPHA7 (human), 5\u2032-GTGAAGATGGGTATTACAGGGC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CAACTGCACCGCTTACACAAT-3\u2032 (reverse);  Epha7 (rat), 5\u2032-TGTTTTTCAGATCCGGGCGT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TTCACTGGACACCGCTGTTG-3\u2032 (reverse);  C/EBP\u03b2 (human), 5\u2032-CTTCAGCCCGTACCTGGAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGAGAGGAAGTCGTGGTGC-3\u2032 (reverse);  C/ebp\u03b2 (rat), 5\u2032-CCACGACTTCCTTTCCGACC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GTAGTCGGACGGCTTCTTGC-3\u2032 (reverse);  KLF4 (human), 5\u2032-CGGACATCAACGACGTGAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GACGCCTTCAGCACGAACT-3\u2032 (reverse);  Klf4 (rat), 5\u2032-GGGCAAGTTTGTGCTGAAGG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGGACGGCCTCTTGCTTAAT-3\u2032 (reverse);  ADAMTS1 (human), 5\u2032-CAGAGCACTATGACACAGCAA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGCCATCCCAAGAGTATCACA-3\u2032 (reverse);  Adamts1 (rat), 5\u2032-CGTAATCCAAGGGGGTCCAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGAGTGGACTAAAGCTGCGG-3\u2032 (reverse);  Cyp11a1 (rat), 5\u2032-CCAAAACACCACGCACTTCC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AACTTGGTCCCCACATCACG-3\u2032 (reverse);  Star (rat), 5\u2032-GAAGAACTGGTGGACCGCAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GTGGAACCTCTACGCTTGGT-3\u2032 (reverse);  \u03b2-ACTIN (human), 5\u2032-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATTAAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3\u2032 (reverse).  \u03b2-Actin (rat), 5\u2032-GGCCAACCGTGAAAAGATGACC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AACCCTCATAGATGGGCACAG-3\u2032 (reverse).    2.14  Western blotting  Total cellular proteins were extracted from cells and rat ovaries specimens using ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Cowbiotech, Beijing, China) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and a phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). The abundance of target genes was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Thirty \u03bcg of protein from each sample were electrophoresed in 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated with EPHA7 antibody (1:500; SAB, Maryland, USA), T-ERK1/2 antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Massachusetts, USA), P-ERK1/2 antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), C/EBP\u03b2 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), KLF4 antibody (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), KLF4 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), ADAMTS1 antibody (1:1000; Abcam), CYP11A1 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) or StAR antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C. After incubation with the appropriate diluted peroxidase-conjugated secondary (SAB), the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used to detect the bands with peroxidase activity. The bands were visualized using a G-Box iChemi Chemiluminescence image capture system (Syngene, Haryana, India). The ratio of band intensity of a target protein to that of the intensity of \u03b2-ACTIN (Proteintech, Wuhan, China) or GAPDH (Proteintech) was obtained as each target protein level.    2.15  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay  The binding of C/EBP\u03b2 to the KLF4 promoter after treatment with or without EPHA7 was measured with ChIP assay referring to previous protocol [ 39 ]. The lysed KGN cells were sonicated and pre-cleaned with Protein A Agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA (Millipore). Then the sheared chromatin DNA was immunoprecipitated with C/EBP\u03b2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or negative control IgG, followed by washing with Magna ChIP Protein A Agarose Magnetic Beads (Millipore). After reverse cross-linking, RNA contamination and protein digestion, sheared DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit for next quantitative analysis. The primer sequences of KLF4 used for qRT-PCR were 5\u2032-CGAACGCCGGAATCCAAAGT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TCCCCTTGGTTTGTGATCAGT-3\u2032 (reverse), which amplified a region between \u2212879\u202fbp and\u202f\u2212\u202f865\u202fbp spanning the putative C/EBP\u03b2 binding site. The ratio of DNA precipitated by C/EBP\u03b2 antibody over input control indicated the amount of bound transcription factor.    2.16  Statistical analysis  Results are presented as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSEM or SD. Each experiment was repeated 3 to 5 times. The data were initially subjected to Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to assess deviation from Gaussian distribution. For normally distributed data, we used paired Student's t -test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test. For data not normally distributed, we applied Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. For all tests, a two-tailed P value <.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical significance is shown as * P <\u202f.05, ** P <\u202f.01, or *** P <\u202f.001.     3  Results   3.1  Decreased mRNA expression of EPHA7 and target genes in granulosa cells of PCOS patients  We examined the relative mRNA expression profiles of EPHA7 , C/EBP\u03b2 , KLF4 , and ADAMTS1 using hGCs collected from PCOS ( n =\u202f40) and non-PCOS ( n =\u202f32) patients who underwent IVF-ET. As shown in Fig. 1 , decreased mRNA abundances of EPHA7 , C/EBP\u03b2 , KLF4, and ADAMTS1 were clearly demonstrated in hGCs of PCOS patients compared with those of non-PCOS patients. These results suggested that low expression levels of EPHA7 , C/EBP\u03b2 , KLF4 , and ADAMTS1 in hGCs are related to the lack of ovulation in PCOS patients and in the development of PCOS itself.

Fig. 1     3.2  Effect and mechanisms of EPAH7 on ovulation-related molecules in KGN cells  The mechanisms by which EPAH7 contributes to ovulation abnormalities remain unclear. Based on our findings of hGCs in PCOS patients, we decided to use human granulosa-like KGN cells for experiments to probe possible specific molecular mechanisms of EPHA7 in ovulation.  After treatment with KLF4 siRNA, we examined the mRNA and protein abundances of ADAMTS1, a human ovulatory marker [ 40 , 41 ], and observed that ADAMTS1 expression tended to decrease ( Fig. 2 A). On the contrary, overexpression of KLF4 using vector transfection led to increased mRNA and protein expressions of ADAMTS1 ( Fig. 2 B). Hence, KLF4 positively regulated ADAMTS1 expression in KGN cells. Fig. 2 EPAH7 promotion of KLF4 expression via C/EBP\u03b2, leading to induction of ADAMTS1 expression in KGN cells.

Fig. 2   We found a C/EBP\u03b2 putative binding site on the KLF4 promoter. After transfection of C/EBP\u03b2 siRNA into KGN cells, we found that the mRNA and protein abundances of KLF4 and ADAMTS1 had decreased ( Fig. 2 C). In addition, C/EBP\u03b2 overexpression led to increased expression of KLF4 and ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein abundances ( Fig. 2 D). Therefore, our evidence showed that C/EBP\u03b2 induces the expression of KLF4 and ADAMTS1 in KGN cells.  Next, we found that knockdown of EPHA7 in KGN cells resulted in reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and decreased expressions of C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4, and ADAMTS1 at both mRNA and protein levels ( Fig. 2 E). Concurrently, treatment of cells with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) for 24\u202fh hindered the expression of downstream factors after overexpressing EPHA7 ( Fig. 2 F).  Furthermore, using ChIP assays, we found that overexpression of EPHA7 actually increases the binding of C/EBP\u03b2 to the KLF4 promoter region containing the C/EBP\u03b2 binding site ( Fig. 2 G). All these data indicated that EPHA7 is a critical upstream factor of ERK1/2-mediated C/EBP\u03b2, which stimulated the transcription and translation of KLF4 and the downstream ADAMTS1 responses in KGN cells. Taken together, EPAH7 stimulates KLF4 expression via C/EBP\u03b2, thus inducing ADAMTS1 expression in KGN cells. EPAH7 and its downstream factors should be considered as essential factors in ovulation.    3.3  Ovulatory dysfunction in rats due to EPHA7 gene silencing by shRNA lentivirus injection  Given our findings of hGCs in PCOS and non-PCOS patients along with the in vitro data in KGN cells, we reckoned that declined expression of EPHA7 might contribute to anovulation. We injected either EPHA7 shRNA or control shRNA lentivirus preparations into the ovaries of SD rats to verify the role of EPHA7 in ovulatory disorders. GFP expression of ovarian slices was observed under fluorescence microscopy after injection to determine the distribution and efficiency of lentiviral transfection (Fig. S1). Each group included six rats. One week after the injection, we induced superovulation and then sacrificed all rats. Immunohistochemical results show that EPHA7 is strongly expressed in GCs, theca cells and the CL of the ovary ( Fig. 3 A). We found no ovarian weight differences between two groups of rats ( Fig. 3 B). As expected, EPHA7 shRNA-injected ovaries displayed remarkably reduced numbers of oocytes retrieved per ovary (9.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.581 oocytes) than the control shRNA-injected ovaries (17.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.291 oocytes) ( Fig. 3 C and D). Moreover, the mRNA and protein abundances of EPHA7, C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 were significantly decreased after the treatment with EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus, which points to EPHA7 and its downstream factors as being players in the ovulatory process of rats ( Fig. 3 E).

Fig. 3     3.4  Effect of treatment duration of EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus on rat ovaries  The EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus injections had given rise to reduced ovulatory ability 1\u202fweek later; hence, we wondered whether the long-term effects of EPHA7 shRNA would include pronounced phenotypic changes in SD rats in vivo that are similar to those observed in PCOS cases (regarding estrus cycle, hormones, and ovarian morphology). We formed two groups of four rats each. This time we sacrificed the rats 3\u202fweeks after the lentivirus injections. We observed irregular estrus cycles during the last 8\u202fdays in the EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus injection rats ( Fig. 4 A), but found no body or ovarian weights differences between the two groups ( Fig. 4 B). Also, the serum FSH levels presented a decreasing tendency, the LH levels remained unchanged, and the LH/FSH ratio exhibited an increasing trend in the rats injected with EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus compared to those treated with control shRNA lentivirus ( Fig. 4 C). Of note, we found fewer corpora lutea and more antral follicles in rats treated with EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus than in control rats ( Fig. 4 D). Thus, we concluded that the 3-week effects of EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus are able to bring about an irregular estrus cycle and lead to polycystic ovaries in rats.

Fig. 4     3.5  A triggering role of EPAH7 in ovulation induction of rats  We used a PMSG-induced superovulation model of immature SD rats for in vivo experiments to verify the vital role of EPHA7 in ovulation taking place of hCG. Recombinant EPHA7-Fc protein (or an equivalent volume of PBS) was injected through the caudal vein at a dose of 0.03\u202fmg/kg of body weight. We formed four groups of five rats each. Three rats in the PBS treatment group and three in the EPHA7 treatment group ovulated; we counted the numbers of oocytes retrieved per ovary (13.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.202 and 21.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.453, respectively), and found that a larger amount of COCs were stimulated and ovulated in the EPHA7 group. All rats in the hCG and hCG\u202f+\u202fEPHA7 groups ovulated, and the numbers of oocytes retrieved were 27.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.030 and 31.20\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.463, respectively ( Fig. 5 A). We found no mRNA expression differences in terms of Epha7 , C/ebp\u03b2 , Klf4 or Adamts1 among the rat ovaries of all the groups ( Fig. 5 B), which is consistent with the rats having indeed ovulated. Since we injected EPHA7-Fc through the caudal vein into rats, we made efforts to explore the systemic role of EPHA7 not only just in the ovary. Thus we examined the concentration of a soluble splice variant of EPHA7 in the serum to observe whether EPHA7 could mimic hormone change in the serum or not. This soluble splice variant has been previously reported [ [42] , [43] , [44] ]. As observed, serum EPHA7 levels reached a peak value 4\u202fh after recombinant EPAH7-Fc protein injection and returned to the normal level 12\u202fh later ( Fig. 5 C). Serum LH levels started to rise 12\u202fh after EPHA7 injection and reached a peak 16\u202fh later, suggesting that EPHA7 triggered an LH surge before ovulation ( Fig. 5 D). Serum E2 levels significantly decreased 16\u202fh after EPHA7 injection due to increased LH levels ( Fig. 5 E). Based on this, EPHA7 is involved in ovulation induction and is able to (at least partially) trigger ovulation. Fig. 5 EPAH7 triggers ovulation after induction in rats.

Fig. 5     3.6  Successful establishment of the PCOS rat model via DHEA injection  We used DHEA injection to disrupt the normal 4-day estrus cycle of control SD rats as verified by daily examination of vaginal smears ( Fig. 6 A). The DHEA-treated rats maintained irregular estrus cycles throughout the examination period. We found no difference in body weights between the DHEA-treated and the control rats, but the DHEA-treated rats showed lighter ovarian weights than the control rats ( Fig. 6 B). In addition, GTT results showed that DHEA injection alters glucose tolerance in rats. While the fasting glucose levels were similar across groups, the DHEA-treated rats displayed marked increased glucose levels after 30, 60 and 90 and 120\u202fmin of glucose administration, and had a bigger area under the curve [ 45 ] compared with the control group rats ( Fig. 6 C). Although the serum EPHA7 level remained constant ( Fig. 6 D), the DHEA injection induced prominent increases in the serum LH level and in the LH/FSH ratio, but a distinct decrease in the serum FSH level compared to those in the control rats ( Fig. 6 E). All these data indicate a successful establishment of a PCOS rat model using the DHEA injections. Fig. 6 Improvement of the 16-h function of EPAH7 in PCOS rats.

Fig. 6     3.7  EPAH7 improved the polycystic ovarian changes and induced ovulation in PCOS rats  After confirming the relationship between EPHA7 and PCOS and verifying the significant positive role of EPHA7 in ovulation, we set up to investigate whether exogenous EPHA7 can improve the DHEA-induced phenotypic changes in PCOS rats. Recombinant EPHA7-Fc protein was injected through the caudal vein at a dose of 0.03\u202fmg/kg at 7\u202fweeks of age, once the PCOS rat model was considered successfully set up. Rats were divided into four groups of six each. As seen in the figures, 16\u202fh after exogenous EPHA7 injection, the estrus cycles ( Fig. 6 A), body and ovarian weights ( Fig. 6 B), and glucose tolerance results ( Fig. 6 C) of PCOS rats were not affected compared with those in control rats. The serum EPHA7 level remained unchanged, which was consistent with our previous result ( Fig. 6 D). Although the EPHA7 injection had no effect on the serum FSH level, it significantly increased the serum LH level and the LH/FSH ratio, not only in CONTROL+EPHA7 rats but also in DHEA+EPHA7 rats ( Fig. 6 E). We found the EPAH7 injection dramatically improves the polycystic ovarian changes in PCOS rats. We observed more corpora lutea and fewer large antral follicles in the DHEA+EPHA7 rats than in the DHEA rats ( Fig. 6 F, S2). At the same time, the mRNA and protein abundances of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) [ 3 ] and cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) ( Fig. 6 G), as well as the serum progesterone level ( Fig. 6 H), were also much higher in DHEA+EPHA7 rats compared with those in DHEA rats. According to these phenotypes, we asserted that EPHA7 might promote the progress of ovulation and the generation of the CL in PCOS rats. In addition, we detected the mRNA and protein abundances of EPHA7, C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 in the ovaries of these rats. The evident lower EPHA7, C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 abundances in DHEA rats compared with those in control rats ( Fig. 6 I) are consistent with the differences we observed in hGCs between PCOS and non-PCOS patients. Most importantly, the EPAH7 injection induced the expression of C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 in rat ovaries (Fig. 6I). We also performed a similar experiment in which all rats were sacrificed 48\u202fh after the EPHA7 injections (Fig. S3) and got very similar results. In conclusion, our results suggest EPHA7 together with its downstream factors improves the polycystic changes of ovaries and induces ovulation in rats with DHEA-induced PCOS.     4  Discussion  Ovulation is a dynamic and rather complicated process initiated by LH, leading to breakdown of the follicular wall and extrusion of the oocyte. Substantial evidence has pointed to an ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS, which is directly associated with female infertility. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings affecting ovulation defects will aid the development of effective treatments for ovulation induction during assisted reproductive technology (ART) approaches.  C/EBP\u03b2, stimulated by LH and regulated by the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, plays an essential role in ovulation and luteinization [ 5 , 8 ]. We discovered that the C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA abundance in the hGCs of PCOS patients was significantly lower than those in non-PCOS patients, which suggested a connection between C/EBP\u03b2 and PCOS. We analyzed previous ChIP-seq data and focused on EPHA7 that was possibly associated with C/EBP\u03b2 in PCOS [ [19] , [20] , [21] ]. The EPH-EFN family genes are widely expressed during embryonic development and its proteins function in various physiological processes during organ development. EPHA7 has also been shown to participate in neural and pronephros development [ 46 ]. EPHA7 has also attracted attention in human malignancy studies on prostate, small cell lung, and colorectal cancers; on human germinal center B-cell and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas; on oral squamous cell and head and neck carcinomas; and in melanomas, among others [ 47 ]. Although a few members of the EPH-EFN family have confirmed ovarian functions [ [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] ], the role of EPHA7 in female fertility, let alone its involvement in PCOS, has never been demonstrated. In this study, we showed that the EPHA7 mRNA expression levels in hGCs of PCOS patients were decreased in comparison with those in non-PCOS patients. The same trend was demonstrated in the ovaries of rats with DHEA-induced PCOS. We confirmed wide EPHA7 expression in the rat ovaries, especially in the GCs, theca cells, and CL. Additionally, the injection of EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus in rats' ovaries gave rise to declined ovulatory abilities (as seen after 1\u202fweek), and to menstrual disorders and morphological changes of polycystic ovaries (as seen after 3\u202fweeks). In here, we have presented these in vivo and in vitro results as the first evidence for an important role of EPHA7 in ovulation and PCOS.  In addition to EPHA7, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) had also been identified via ChIP-seq analyzes as a putative C/EBP\u03b2-target gene in PCOS [ [19] , [20] , [21] ]. KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor suggested to play various roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, cycle regulation, and adipogenesis as well as to function as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on its molecular context [ [48] , [49] , [50] , [51] , [52] ]. Moreover, KLF4 is expressed in several epithelia of the male and female murine reproductive tracts and participates in spermatogenesis [ 48 , 53 ]. Notably, the regulation of KLF4 expression in ovarian GCs by LH is associated with steroidogenic genes comprising the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), StAR and CYP11A1 [ 54 ]. Our results showing rather low levels of KLF4 mRNA abundance in the hGCs of PCOS patients were expected. We thought it likely that KLF4 played a part in PCOS and might be involved in the functions of hGCs, although only limited amounts of molecular and genetic data were available. ADAMTS1 has been identified as a new human ovulatory gene and a cumulus marker for fertilization capacity [ 40 ]. Female rats with Adamts1 disruption are subfertile with mature oocytes trapped in follicles\u2014the rats' ovulation rates are reduced by 77% and the fertilization of ovulated oocytes is further reduced by 63% [ 13 , 55 ]. ADAMTS1 is indispensable for extracellular matrix remodeling during ovarian folliculogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [ 56 ]. What's more, the decreased expression of ADAMTS1 in hGCs of PCOS patients compared to that in normally ovulating women is consistent with our results, and explains the abnormal findings in oocyte recovery, oocyte maturity, and fertilization rates [ 57 ]. Using KGN cells, we obtained evidence implicating EPHA7 as a critical positive upstream factor of ERK1/2-mediatd C/EBP\u03b2 expression, which further binds to the KLF4 promoter stimulating its transcription and translation, and then leads to the downstream expression of ADAMTS1. Likewise, the rat ovaries that were injected with EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus and produced fewer oocytes, also displayed the mRNA and protein abundances of EPHA7, C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 that were all distinctly reduced. Based on our data, we concluded that EPAH7 together with its downstream factors is vitally involved in ovulation.  To further investigate the role of EPHA7 in the treatment of ovulation induction for PCOS patients, we used the Recombinant Mouse EphA7-Fc Chimera Protein. The alignments of EPHA7 nucleotide and protein sequences between mice and rats are respectively 96% and 99%. After stimulating follicle development with PMSG, we injected EPHA7 through the caudal vein instead of the usual hCG. The number of oocytes retrieved was larger than that in control rats injected with PBS, which indicated a triggering role of EPAH7 for ovulation induction in rats. Four hours after EPHA7 injection, serum EPHA7 levels reached the peak and then gradually returned to normal. Serum LH levels began to rise 12\u202fh after the injection and E 2 levels decreased 16\u202fh later. Generally, hCG is regarded as an upstream activator of ovulatory genes, but it has not been shown to be a regulator of EPH/EFN in GCs [ 31 ]. Here we propose that the exogenous EPHA7 probably contributed to the rise of serum LH levels in the female rats, and that this preovulatory LH surge initiated and synchronized a series of biochemical events before ovulation. Since serum E 2 levels were not increased after EPHA7-Fc administration, we excluded the role of positive feedback of E 2 in upregulating LH secretion. The decrease of serum E 2 levels resulted from the increase of LH levels. As known, the serum estrogen binds ER\u03b1 on the pituitary gland and stimulates LH secretion [ 58 ]. Similarly, insulin could also facilitate LH secretion via the pituitary insulin receptor [ 59 ]. EFNA5 has always been considered as the ligand of EPHA7 [ 47 , 60 ] and it is strongly expressed in the pituitary of mice [ 61 ] and in the brain of rats [ 62 ]. Thus, we suspect that the injected recombinant EPHA7-Fc protein reached the pituitary gland via the blood circulation and reacted with EFNA5, to then stimulate LH secretion. Another possibility is that the existing crosstalk between EPHB2 and EFNA5 in the EPH-EFN interaction network [ 63 , 64 ] had indirect effects on the availability of other molecules in the system. In other words, the binding of EPHA7 and EFNA5 in the peripheral blood, would free up EPHB2 molecules that would presumably interact with other factors. For example, the increased level of unbound EPHB2 might bind to EFNB2, expressed on the rat pituitary gland [ 65 , 66 ], and would promote the secretion of LH. Alternatively, EPHA7 may directly modulate EFNB2 activity via lateral cis interactions on the same cell [ 67 ], just like the reported attenuation by EFNB2 of the trans ligand-binding capacity of EPHA3 and its activation via lateral cis interactions [ 68 ]. However, the exact molecular mechanism about the effect of EPHA7-Fc systemic administration on upregulating LH secretion is not yet understood and warrants further research.  We successfully established a PCOS rat model using DHEA according to a publication [ 36 ]. Sixteen hours after EPHA7 injection, more corpora lutea and fewer antral follicles were observed in PCOS rat ovaries. At the same time, the serum LH and progesterone levels increased significantly. That is to say, EPHA7 promoted the progress of ovulation in PCOS rats. And during this process, the mRNA and protein abundances of EPHA7, C/EBP\u03b2, KLF4 and ADAMTS1 in rat ovaries were all significantly increased. Therefore, we concluded that EPHA7 and its downstream factors directly helped trigger ovulation in PCOS rats. At the same time, EPHA7 facilitated LH secretion further contributing to ovulation. Based on our results, these two functions of EPHA7 dramatically improved the polycystic changes in PCOS rat ovaries induced by DHEA. This improvement of polycystic ovarian changes was clearer in the 48-h experiment than in the 16-h one. The levels of serum progesterone secreted by corpora lutea were also much higher in the 48-h experiment, suggesting the presence of more corpora lutea in rat ovaries. Since the serum EPHA7 level came back to normal only 16\u202fh after the EPHA7 injection, we asserted that the resulting raised LH levels generated the ovulation after 16\u202fh.  Considering a future clinical application for EPHA7, a protein molecule already existing in the body, we tried to confirm the safety of exogenous EPHA7 injections. We observed no changes in appearance, characteristics, or life habits of treated rats after 48\u202fh or 14\u202fdays. We also found similar body weights (Fig. S4A), ovarian weights (Fig. S4B) and ovary appearances (Fig. S4C) between EPHA7-treated and PBS-control rats. Meanwhile, all tissue sections were free of visible acute or chronic toxicities (Fig. S4D). Finally, the negative results of routine blood examinations and blood biochemical indexes of rats implied a lack of bone marrow inhibition, or hepatic or renal toxicities (Table S1). Hence, our preliminary results indicate that exogenous EPHA7 injections can be considered safe.  Among the limitations of our study is the fact that we assessed only the number of oocytes retrieved in order to evaluate the role of EPHA7 in ovulation. The reduced fertility of PCOS patients could be attributed not only to a failure to release mature oocytes, but also to ovum growth obstacles. After all, oocyte maturity and fertilization rate are both closely related to female fertility, which would be further investigated to demonstrate the truly imperative role of EPHA7 in ovulation. Secondly, due to the technical difficulties for maintaining sufficient numbers of primary hGCs and the complexity of the EPHA7-mediated pathway studied, we decided to perform our experiments using the KGN cells. However, we obtained convincing evidence for a probable regulatory relationship between EPHA7 and downstream factors in human ovaries. Given the differences among species, more experiments in various animals and clinical trials will be required in the future.  Our study revealed that EPHA7 is a positive upstream factor of C/EBP\u03b2 contributing to the transcription and translation of KLF4, promoting ovulation via ADAMTS1. We demonstrated the functional role of EPHA7 in PCOS, which explains how the loss of EPHA7 underlies the ovulatory dysfunction. Our findings suggest EPHA7 may be a crucial and useful target for developing drugs for ovulation induction in ART treatment.  Findings from this study have been used to apply for a patent (China patent No. 201810166416.9).",
