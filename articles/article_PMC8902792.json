    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disease with various symptoms, which affects 5-10% of females of reproductive age (1, 2). The main clinical features of PCOS are being overweight, hyperandrogenaemia, polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperinsulinemia (3). Although the etiology of PCOS is not completely understood yet, scientific studies suggest that uncontrolled steroidogenesis may be the primary feature in this syndrome (4). PCOS, as a complex heterogeneous disease, can be associated with various genetic, metabolic, endocrine and environmental abnormalities such as being overweight or obese, type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism and increased luteinizing hormone (LH) (5, 6).  Increases in oxidative stress levels and inflammatory markers, LH and androgens, and a significant reduction in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen have been reported in patients with PCOS and also in animal models of PCOS (7, 8). It has been shown that non-chemical and herbal ingredients can have considerable effects on recovery and improvement of some abnormalities and disorders in PCOS patients, and many studies have been conducted on their effects on the hormonal and metabolic factors and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in PCOS (9-42).  This review summarizes the studies conducted over a given period that show the efficacy of these non-chemical and herbal substances in treating PCOS.

Materials and Methods  This review was carried out using relevant keywords in the electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Reaxys. Articles were limited to those published from January 2009 to December 2019 and we used the keywords \u201cnon-chemical treatment\u201d, \u201cherbal treatment\u201d, \u201cphytotherapy\u201d, \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d and \u201cPCOS\u201d. We conducted searches to capture all animal studies and pre-clinical and clinical studies explaining the effects of herbal extracts on PCOS. In addition, we manually searched bibliographies of review articles. A total of 230 studies were found to be about the effects of herbal compositions on the treatment of PCOS. We excluded clinical and animal studies investigating herbal medicines with unrelated outcomes and finally 34 studies were selected.    3. Results  There have been numerous studies on the etiology of PCOS and its common and traditional herbal and non-chemical treatments (1-47). Each of these treatments has different effects. Most of them can partially improve metabolic and hormonal abnormalities. This can be an effective way for preventing and treating PCOS by affecting the factors involved in the disease. Some important experimental studies with significant results and human and clinical trials are described in table I. In most of these studies, the regulation and balance of the steroidogenic enzymes, sex steroid profile, LH: FSH ratio, lipid profile, glucose or insulin levels were reported, which aimed to improve and treat PCOS disease.    4. Discussion  This review lists laboratory, clinical, and animal studies which used phytotherapy to treat PCOS disease (9-42). The results demonstrated the importance and potential of herbal and non-chemical therapies to improve the hormonal status such as FSH, LH, their ratios and significant recovery in the biochemical and clinical parameters of PCOS. For example, in one study this was done through restoring the estrus cyclicity, decreasing cystic follicles, LH and testosterone levels, and increasing estradiol and FSH concentrations in PCOS rats treated with Phyllanthus muellerianus ( Euphorbiaceae ) (42). Another example was berberine, which in human trials, combined with Chinese herbs, showed positive effects on alleviating insulin resistance, and improving glycolipid metabolism and reproductive endocrine conditions (43).  Since there were different results from different herbal compounds in these studies, it is necessary to classify herbal compounds according to the hormonal and neurological factors and changes in gene expression level. A number of herbal compounds and substances can be given more attention as they control and influence hormones at the level of the central nervous system and its major axes in the reproductive system, including testosterone, estrogen, LH and FSH (9, 32, 38, 39, 41, 42). In some studies, the effect of neuropeptides such as from the galanin family have been evaluated in the treatment of PCOS disease (44, 45). PCOS patients have been shown to have significantly lower levels of nesfatin-1 (45) and also one study showed a small increase in galanin, but this was not significant compared to the control group (46). Recently, we demonstrated that galanin as a neuropeptide could ameliorate the metabolic and reproductive disturbances in a rat model of PCOS (47).  Determining the exact causes of the disease and its molecular basis can certainly play a key role in the treatment of PCOS using non-chemical and herbal ingredients and neuropeptides. Further pre-clinical, clinical and experimental studies are needed to show the effects of these non-chemical components for the management of PCOS.    5. Conclusion  This review demonstrated the variability and effects of phytotherapy and non-chemical treatments associated with PCOS disease. These findings may help future studies on the etiology and treatment of this syndrome, which is the most common cause of female infertility.    Conflict of Interest  The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.",
