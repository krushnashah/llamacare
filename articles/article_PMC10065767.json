    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in\nwomen of reproductive age with 12 to 18% affected worldwide ( Joham et al. , 2016 ). The clinical presentation\nis heterogenous, and different criteria and phenotypes are used depending on the\npresence or absence of features like hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and\npolycystic ovarian morphology ( Azziz et\nal ., 2016 ). It is a disorder with a poor understood etiology\nand its phenotype varies by race and ethnicity, and is exacerbated by obesity ( Dumesic et al. , 2015 ). Women\nwith PCOS present a higher risk of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus,\ncardiovascular complications, excessive weight and metabolic syndrome compared to\nother women ( Azziz et al .,\n2016 ; Carvalho et al. ,\n2018 ). PCOS is the most frequent cause of hyperandrogenism and\noligo-anovulation in females in reproductive age and both of these features can\ncause social and psychological problems. As a complication to chronic anovulation,\ninfertility can also be a consequence ( Norman et al ., 2007 ).  Genetics have been important in the study of PCOS due to its complexity and because\nseveral genes are involved in its etiology. The genetic etiology was first\nquestioned by Cooper et al. (1968) and multiple genes have been studied to try to find a connection\nto PCOS. One gene of interest is follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene.\nFSHR is one of the receptors where polymorphisms can be involved in the etiology of\nPCOS due to its involvement in the development of gonads. It encodes a G-coupled\nprotein receptor which is expressed in granulosa cells, and is located at chromosome\n2p21-p16 and consists of 10 exons ( Gromoll &\nSimoni, 2005 ). FSHR encode follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and any\ndysfunctions in this receptor may disturb the function of follicles and ovaries\n( Ajmal et al. , 2019 ).\nMutations which inactivate FSHR will lead to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which\ncan cause the follicles to stagnate in the preantral state ( McAllister et al. , 2015 ). In 2005, 731 (single\nnuclear polymorphisms) SNPs were identified in the FSHR gene ( Gromoll & Simoni, 2005 ) in 2014 this number was 900 SNPs\n( Simoni & Casarini, 2014 ) and in\n2019, around 1800 SNPs of FSHR gene have been reported. Only eight of these SNPs are\nlocated in the coding region, and seven of them occur in exon 10. Six of the SNPs\nresult in an amino acid substitution and one of the most common SNPs are Ala307Thr\n(rs6165) ( Laven, 2019 ) where threonine (Thr)\nis replaced by alanine (Ala) ( Simoni & Casarini,\n2014 ).  The next gene in this study is Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplastic\nDevelopment Isoform 1A (DENND1A) gene, also called differentially expressed in\nnormal and neoplastic development isoform 1A gene. It has been identified as a risk\nmarker for PCOS and is located at chromosome 9q33.3. This is a poorly characterized\nprotein that regulate Rab-mediated membrane trafficking pathways ( Mykhalchenko et al. , 2017 ) and\nis placed inside the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of ovarian theca cells. Two\nvariants, DENND1A variant 1 (DENND1A.V1) and DENND1A variant 2 (DENND1A.V2), have\nbeen found, and the first variant encodes a protein with a proline-rich domain,\nwhile the second variant lack this domain, but include a C-terminal 33-aa sequence\n( Crespo et al. ,\n2018 ).  McAllister et al . (2014) found that DENND1A.V2 is elevated in theca\ncells in PCOS patients. They tried to force an overexpression of DENND1A.V2 in\nnormal theca cells, which resulted in an increased androgen synthesis compatible\nwith the elevated androgen profile we can find in PCOS women. Contrarily, when they\ntried to reduce these levels, the androgen synthesis was decreased, and the authors\nconcluded that DENND1A plays a role in hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS ( McAllister et al. , 2014 ). The\nreason for this increased expression has not been identified, but by its\nlocalization, DENND1A.V2 can influence both gonadotropin and insulin receptors, and\nthereby increase the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. This variant of DENND1A\ngene has likewise been localized in the reticular zone in adrenal glands, which also\ncan cause an abnormal androgen synthesis in women with PCOS ( McAllister et al. , 2015 ).  Many studies have tried to find an association with these genes and PCOS, both in\nEurope and Asia. Considering that the results have been controversial, I decided to\ndo a meta-analysis with rs6165 and rs2479106 SNPs in FSHR gene and DENND1A gene\nrespectively to see if they have an association to PCOS.    MATERIAL AND METHODS   Data sources and selection criteria  Pubmed was used to identify studies, and the relevant search was done in January\nand February 2020. The keywords correlated with the polymorphisms of interest\nand the following words were used: \u201cFSHR\u201d, \u201crs6165\u201d, \u201cDENND1A\u201d, \u201crs2479106\u201d,\n\u201cpolymorphism\u201d, \u201cgene\u201d all coupled with \u201cPolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d or \u201cPCOS\u201d.\nThe primary outcome was PCOS women with the risk allele belonging to the\npolymorphisms in this study.  Studies were included in this meta-analysis only if following criteria were met:\n(1) case-control study where patients are not related to controls; (2) rs6165 or\nrs2479106 polymorphisms; (3) clear criteria of diagnosis; (4) genotype\nfrequencies of genes were available, both patients and controls; (5) the\nfrequency genotype distribution was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n(HWE). Studies with these criteria were excluded: (1) animal studies; (2)\nforeign languages; (3) meta-analysis, reviews, family studies; (4) not\nsufficient data; (5) other polymorphisms.  The meta-analysis is registered in the International prospective register of\nsystematic reviews (PROSPERO) under designation CRD42021229235.    Data extraction  The extracted data from each study included: the name of the first author, year\nof publication, country and ethnicity of the population in the study, diagnosis\ncriteria of PCOS, sample size of patients and controls, mean age and body mass\nindex (BMI) of patients and controls and distribution of genotype- and allele\nfrequencies.    Statistical analysis  In this research, Review Manager 5.3 (provided by Cochrane Collaboration) was\nused to make forest plots for each of the polymorphisms. The association between\npolymorphism of interest and PCOS was evaluated by odds ratio (OR) with\ncorresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p -value. P -values <0.05 is considered significant. To find the\npooled OR calculation, each polymorphism had three genetic models; allelic model\n(risk allele vs . non-risk allele), recessive model (homozygote\nrisk-allele genotype vs . heterozygote genotype + homozygote\nnon-risk genotype) and dominant model (homozygote risk-allele genotype +\nheterozygote genotype vs . homozygote non-risk allele\ngenotype).  Heterogeneity is tested with Cochrane\u00b4s Q test, which will give a I 2 value and its corresponding p -value. The choice of forest plot\nmodel depends on the heterogeneity results, and according to Cochrane handbook,\nI 2 <50% and p \u22650.1 show no\nheterogeneity, and a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model is chosen.\nI 2 \u226550% and p <0.1 are indications of\nheterogeneity and random-effects model are preferred. If a model shows\nheterogeneity, subgroup analysis based on ethnicity will be investigated to see\nif this is the reason for variability.  Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) is tested in all controls by comparing the\nobserved genotypes frequencies to the expected ones in \u03c7 2 Goodness-of-Fit test. P -values <0.05 are not consistent with\nHWE, and are not included in this analysis.  Publication bias is also estimated in this study, and studies that are not\nstatistically significant but have positive results, may bias the result in a\nmeta-analysis and can lead to a false-positive result. In this analysis, a\nfunnel plot made in Review manager is used to estimate publication bias.     RESULTS   Characteristics of included studies  In the identification of articles concerning FSHR and DENND1A polymorphisms, a\ntotal of 65 studies from Pubmed were identified. 30 of these were excluded after\nreading the title and abstract due to irrelevance to the chosen genes or\npolymorphisms. 35 full-text texts were assessed for eligibility, and 16 articles\nwere excluded because of family study (n=1), review (n=2), no information about\ngenotype (n=4), not relevant to topic (n=4) or not correct polymorphisms (n=5).\nFinally, 19 articles have been used in this meta-analysis (Flowchart in Figure 1 ), and all included articles are in\nEnglish language.   Figure 1 Flowchart of included articles in meta-analysis.    The polymorphism related to FSHR gene is rs6165 (Ala307Thr). A total of 1539\ncases of PCOS patients and 1877 controls from eight studies are included, and\nthe articles were published from 2009 to 2018. Extracted information include\nlast name of author, year of publication, country, ethnicity, the definition\ncriteria, sample size, mean age and BMI for both PCOS patients and controls\n( Table 1 ). 2/8 studies have Caucasian\nethnicity ( Unsal et al. ,\n2009 ; Branavan et\nal. , 2018 ) while the last six have an Asian origin ( Gu et al. , 2010 ; Fu et al. , 2013 ; Singhasena et al. , 2014 ; Wu et al. , 2014 ; Liaqat et al. , 2015 ; Kim et al. , 2017 ).\nThe Rotterdam criteria is used in 7/8 studies, which include two out of three of\nthe PCOS features: oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries\n(Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004). In the\nstudy of Branavan et al . (2018), patients with PCOS had to have\nall the three diagnostic features (oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism and\npolycystic ovaries) to be included.

The higher number of studies is because the article by Welt et\nal . (2012) include populations from Boston, Chicago and Iceland,\nbut they are separately analyzed in this paper. The articles were published from\n2011 to 2020, and extracted information is first name of author, year of\npublication, country and ethnicity of PCOS patients and controls, definition\ncriteria, sample size, mean age and mean BMI for both PCOS patients and controls\n( Table 1 ). Four of the articles have\nan Asian population ( Gammoh et\nal. , 2015 ; Xu et\nal. , 2015 ; Xia et al. , 2019 ; Zhu et al. , 2020 ) one article has an Arab\npopulation ( Dallel et al., 2018 ) while the last three articles have included women with a\nCaucasian ethnicity ( Lerchbaum et\nal., 2011 ; Eriksen et al. , 2012 ; Welt et al. , 2012 ). Seven of the studies used the\nRotterdam criteria, while one article by Welt et al . (2012)\nused the NIH criteria which includes the presence of chronic anovulation and\nhyperandrogenism ( Azziz, 2005 ).    Meta-analysis  The association between rs6165 polymorphism in FSHR gene and the risk of PCOS has\nbeen analyzed based on allele and genotype frequencies with HWE values ( Table 2 ), and pooled OR with 95% CI and\nheterogeneity values has been investigated. No relations were discovered between\nrs6165 polymorphism and increased risk of PCOS in any of the models, seen in\nforest plots in Figure 2 (allelic model:\nOR=1.07, 95% CI=0.97-1.19, p =0.18; recessive model: OR=1.21,\n95% CI=0.98-1.50, p =0.07; dominant model: OR=1.05, 95% CI:\n0.91-1.20, p =0.53). A fixed model was used in each of them\nbecause the heterogeneity test did not show significant heterogeneity (allelic\nmodel: I 2 =37%, p =0.14; recessive model:\nI 2 =38%, p =0.13; dominant model:\nI 2 =8%, p =0.37). Because of these values, subgroup\nanalysis was not necessary.   Table 2   Allele and genotype frequencies with HWE values of rs6165 polymorphism in\nFSHR gene.

In the study of rs2479106 polymorphism in DENND1A gene, 10 studies are included\nin the analysis of allele frequencies, while only five of the articles are\nincluded in the study of genotype distribution ( Lerchbaum et al. , 2011 ; Eriksen et al. , 2012 ; Gammoh et al. , 2015 ; Xia et al. , 2019 ; Zhu et al. , 2020 ).\nAllelic-, genotype frequencies and HWE values can be found in Table 3 , and the genotype distribution of\nthe controls were all consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

In the allelic model ( Figure 3 ), individuals\nwith the minor G allele did not have a significant risk for PCOS compared to\npeople with major A allele (OR=1.09, 95% CI=0.98-1.21, p =0.10).\nBecause p =0.09 in the heterogeneity test, a random model was\nused. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was done by ethnicity, and neither the\nAsian subgroup (OR=1.26, 95% CI=0.97-1.63, p =0.09) nor the\nCaucasian subgroup (OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.94-1.14, p =0.50) showed a\nsignificant association with PCOS. In this subgroup analysis, the study of\nDallel et al . (2018) was not included since it was the only\nstudy with an Arab ethnicity. The heterogeneity in the Caucasian subgroup\ndisappeared (I 2 =0%, p =0.48), while it remained in\nthe Asian subgroup (I 2 =70%, p =0.02).  In the recessive model ( Figure 4 ), pooled\nOR=1.26, 95% CI=0.73-2.19 and p -value=0.41, which suggest that\nan association with PCOS was not found in patients with this genetic model. The\nheterogeneity test showed heterogeneity (I 2 =67%, p =0.02), and a subgroup analysis was done to study the possible\ncause. In the subgroup analysis, an association with PCOS risk was discovered in\nthe Asian population (OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.19-2.85, p =0.006), but\nnot in the Caucasian population (OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.43-1.49, p =0.49).  No association with PCOS was found in the dominant model ( Figure 5 ) of rs2479106 polymorphism (OR=1.31, 95%\nCI=1.00-1.71, p =0.05). Because of the mild heterogeneity found\nin this analysis (I 2 =57%, p =0.06), random model was\nused and a subgroup analysis was done. These results also indicated that this\npolymorphism neither has an increased risk of PCOS in Asians (OR=1.51, 95%\nCI=0.91-2.50, p =0.11) nor in Caucasians (OR=1.12, 95%\nCI=0.89-1.41, p =0.35). The heterogeneity disappeared in the\nCaucasian population (I 2 =0%, p =0.49), but remained\nin the Asian population (I 2 =72%, p =0.03).    Sensitivity analysis  In the sensitivity analysis of the allelic model of rs6165 polymorphism in FSHR\ngene, the result was mildly associated with PCOS when the study of Fu et\nal . (2013) was removed (OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.01-1.30, p =0.03). A weak association was also seen when removing\nthree different studies in the recessive model: Gu et al .\n(2010): OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.01-1.59, p =0.04; Fu et\nal . (2013): OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.04-1.71, p =0.02; Liaqat et al. (2015) : OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.01-1.58, p =0.04. On the other\nhand, no individual study affected the pooled OR (95% CI) in the dominant model\nof this polymorphism.  Results changed when single studies were removed in every genetic model in the\nsensitivity analysis of rs2479106 polymorphism in DENND1A gene,. In the allelic\nmodel, a very mild association with PCOS risk appeared when Lerchbaum et al. (2011) was removed (OR=1.12, 95% CI=1.00-1.24, p =0.04). The result is\nstatistically significant because p <0.05. The removal of the\nsame study changed also the result in the recessive model (OR=1.63, 95%\nCI=1.12-2.36, p =0.01) and indicated a more obvious association\nwith this polymorphism and the risk of PCOS. In the dominant model, Xia et al . (2019) changed the overall results after it was\nremoved (OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.94-1.36, p =0.18), and the\nassociation with PCOS and the polymorphism disappeared.    Publication bias  In the evaluation of funnel plots of both rs6165 and rs2479106 polymorphisms, no\nobvious asymmetry was found in any of the genetic models.     DISCUSSION  FSHR gene is a familiar gene that has been studied for years. The first study that\ninvestigated the coding region of this gene back in 2001, found no mutations in\nChinese Singapore patients with PCOS, and controls and patients showed similar\ndistributions of variations in alleles ( Tong et al. , 2001 ).  In this research, no association was found with polymorphism rs6165 and PCOS in any\nof the models. Only 1/8 studies ( Kim et\nal. , 2017 ) showed a relation with PCOS in the allelic,\nrecessive and dominant model. When the sensitivity analysis was done, the result was\nmildly changed in two models. After the removal of the study by Fu et\nal . (2013) in the allelic model, a mildly association with PCOS\nappeared, and a mildly association was also the result after removing three studies,\none by one ( Gu et al. , 2010 ; Fu et al. , 2013 ; Liaqat et al. , 2015 ).  Exactly like our result, other papers did not find a relation between PCOS and rs6165\npolymorphism. In a meta-analysis from 2014, the investigation of seven studies did\nnot find an association with PCOS in any of the models ( Chen et al. , 2014 ) and the same result was also\nfound in a research paper from 2010 ( Du et\nal. , 2010 ). Also a third meta-analysis from 2015, where 11\nstudies were included, found no significant association with this polymorphism and\nPCOS ( Qiu et al. , 2015 ). No\nheterogeneity was found in any of the models, so no subgroup analysis was necessary\nbased on Asian and Caucasian ethnicity.  The polymorphism in DENND1A gene of interest in this work, rs2479106, is susceptible\nregarding the association with PCOS. In a study from 2012, this polymorphism was\nalso associated with an increased risk of endometroid adenocarcinoma in patients\nwith PCOS ( Wang et al. ,\n2012 ). In addition, insulin levels have been investigated concerning the\nDENND1A gene, and other polymorphisms of DENND1A have been associated with increased\ninsulin levels ( Cui et al. ,\n2013 ). Several polymorphisms have been analyzed, and in a research from\n2016, Gao et al . (2016) investigated some of them. They found\nrelations with PCOS and polymorphisms rs10818854 and rs10986105, while the\npolymorphism in our study, rs2479106, only had an increased risk of PCOS in Asian\npatients ( Gao et al. ,\n2016 ).  A significant association with PCOS and polymorphism rs2479106 was not found in the\nallelic and recessive model. In the dominant model, 95% CI=1.00-1.71 and p =0.05, which is insufficient to conclude if the groups are\nstatistically significant different. Therefore, further studies have to be done to\nsee if this model have an association with PCOS. In the allelic model, which is the\nmodel with most studies included (n=10), only one study ( Xia et al. , 2019 ) showed an association with\nincreased risk of PCOS. This article was also the only one with an association with\nPCOS both in the recessive (GG vs . GA+AA) and dominant model (GG+GA vs . AA).  When single studies were removed in the sensitivity analysis of this polymorphism,\nall the models had some changes. In the allelic model, a mild association appeared\nbecause p =0.04, but since 95% CI=1.00-1.24, it is insufficient to\nconclude because of these values. A stronger association appeared in the recessive\nmodel (95% CI=1.12-2.36, p =0.01) when removing the study of\nLerchbaum et al . (2011), while the association from the dominant\nstudy, disappeared completely when removing the study of Xia et al .\n(2019) (95% CI=0.94-1.36, p =0.18). Because the models were\nsensitive to the removal of only one study, additional research have been done to\nstrengthen the result.  Other meta-analysis have also been investigating this polymorphism. A study from 2016\nindicated that patients with rs2479106 polymorphism have increased risk to get PCOS\ncompared to controls in allele-, heterozygote- and dominant genetic model ( Bao et al. , 2016 ). Differently,\nanother paper from 2016 did not find a significant association between patients with\nPCOS and controls in the allelic model of rs2479106 ( Gao et al. , 2016 ).  All three models did show moderate heterogeneity (allelic model: I 2 =40%, p =0.09; recessive model: I 2 =67%, p =0.02; dominant model: I 2 =57%, p =0.06), and subgroup analysis was done in each of them. In the\nallelic model, four articles were included in the Asian population, while five of\nthem had Caucasian background. No association was found with PCOS in any of them.\nThe heterogeneity did disappear in the Caucasian one, while the Asian population\nwent from moderate to high heterogeneity (I 2 =70%, p =0.02), which must be due to other reasons than ethnicity.  In the subgroup analysis in the recessive model, the Asian population showed an\nassociation with increased risk of PCOS (95% CI=1.19-2.85). The heterogeneity\ndisappeared in the Asian subgroup (I 2 =0%), while it remained a moderate\nheterogeneity in the Caucasian subgroup (I 2 =57%). The Asian population\nconsisted of three studies, while only two populations were Caucasian, which is an\nextremely low number to have in a subgroup analysis. In addition, the value of the\noverall heterogeneity in the subgroups (I 2 =78.3%), indicate that the\nsubgroups are different from one another, and that there are still differences in\nthe same ethnicity. Low number of studies were also the case in the dominant\nsubgroup analysis based on ethnicity, and the heterogeneity remained in the Asian\npopulation.  This meta-analysis has also its limitations. First, heterogeneity was found in all\nmodels in the study of DENND1A rs2479106 polymorphism. In the analysis of Caucasian\npopulation, heterogeneity remained in the recessive model, which also was the case\nwith the Asian population in the analysis of the allelic model. This can for example\nbe due to other factors not counted for in this meta-analysis, like obesity, BMI or\nerrors with methods and genotyping in each study. Second, a small number of studies\nare included, especially in subgroup analysis of the recessive and dominant model in\nDENND1A gene rs2479106 SNP (three studies with Asian origin and two studies with\nCaucasian origin). A low number of studies can weaken the statistical power of the\nanalysis and can increase the false negative or false positive results, and it need\nto be interpreted with caution. Third, the ethnicities of the included articles were\nonly Asian and Caucasian. No studies from Africa were found, and a broader\ninvestigation based on ethnicity should be done in the future to see if genetic\norigin matter. Fourth, only English articles were included, and relevant articles\nand results can therefore be missed. A search in multiple languages, especially in\nChinese, could have improved the outcome due to their broad research in this\nfield.    CONCLUSION  To conclude, DENND1A rs2479106 polymorphism was the only gene in this study with a\nrelation to PCOS, but it was only seen in the recessive model in patients with Asian\nethnicity. It is unclear to say, since only one model was affected, if this gene is\na part of the pathogenesis of PCOS or not. On the other hand, no associations were\nfound between PCOS and rs6165 polymorphism in FSHR gene. Limitations like small\nsamples sizes, heterogeneity within ethnicities and variable results from\nsensitivity analysis can be found within the polymorphisms, and these results must\nbe interpreted with caution. Absence of ethnicities other than Asian and Caucasian\nwill narrow down the diversity of patients and can increase the false negative or\nfalse positive results in a global perspective. In future researching, less\nheterogeneity and bigger sample sizes with a broader ethnic origin should be\nincluded to strengthen the statistical power and to get a better understanding of\nthis common heterogenous syndrome found in reproductive women.",
