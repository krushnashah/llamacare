    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder during the\nreproductive age, 1 , 2 affecting 5% to 10% of women, 3 and is one of the main causes of infertility. 4 , 5 According to the Rotterdam\ncriteria, PCOS is characterized by two of the following three features: (1) clinical\nand/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (2) oligo- and/or anovulation, and (3)\npolycystic ovaries, excluding other endocrinopathies such as con-genital adrenal\nhyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing\u2019s syndrome. 6  Approximately 50% of women with PCOS are obese 7 and often present with severe metabolic disturbances, and the most severe\nphenotypes are linked to insulin resistance. 8 Those patients who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) show\na large number of immature oocytes, poor embryo quality, miscarriages, and a higher\ninci-dence of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) when compared with non-PCOS\npatients of the same age. 9 , 10 Adverse perinatal outcomes and lower pregnancy rates are\nobserved in obese compared with non-obese PCOS patients. 11 , 12  Although the etiology of PCOS remains unclear, 13 , 14 the concept of a\nmultifactorial disorder with candidate genes involved in steroidogenic and metabolic\npathways has been explored to elucidate the genetic predisposition profile. 15 Multiple genes, environmental factor interactions, and most recently\nhormones, such as Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone, may contribute to the complexity of this\nsyndrome. 13 , 16 However, at present, there is no consensus on genetic\nsusceptibility markers for PCOS. 17  Insulin is well known to play a central role in PCOS, mainly in obese women, and\ncross-reacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor to enhance\novarian and adrenal steroidogenesis, activating tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and\nseveral intracellular signaling cascades. 18 The precise mechanism of insulin action on cumulus cells (CCs) and the\nconsequences for oocyte maturation have not been completely elucidated in obese or\nnon-obese PCOS patients.  Because the CCs, a subset of granulosa cells that maintain an intimate connection\nwith the oocyte, are responsible for providing several trophic and metabolic factors\nto the pre-ovulatory oocyte, 19 we hypothesized that assessing insulin pathway gene expression in these cells\ncould provide another perspective on the pathophysiology and possible treatment for\ninfertile PCOS obese women submitted to IVF who did not exhibit clinical insulin\nresistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the insulin pathway gene\nexpression profile of human CCs from obese versus normal weight\nwomen with PCOS without clinical insulin resistance undergoing IVF treatment.    Methods  This prospective cohort study was carried out at the Human Reproduction Section of\nFederal University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Huntington Reproductive Medicine from January\n2013 to October 2014. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nthe Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (protocol number 1420/09, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil),\nand written informed consent was obtained from all participants.   Study population and CC sample collection  The study population included 15 infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF treatment,\nincluding 9 women with normal body mass index (BMI; between 18.5 and\n25.0\u2009kg/m 2 ) in the PCOS-Normal weight group (PCOS-NORM Group) and\n6 obese women with BMI\u2009\u2a7e\u200930.0\u2009kg/m 2 in the PCOS-Obese group (PCOS-OB\nGroup). The sample size was based on a previous study. 20 PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria. 6 We excluded PCOS women with Homeostasis Model Assessment\u2013Insulin\nResistance (HOMA IR) >3.6 for normal BMI women\n(BMI\u2009=\u200918.5\u201325\u2009kg/m 2 ) and >4.7 for obese women, 20 , 21 as well as\nwomen who were underweight (BMI\u2009<\u200918.5\u2009kg/m 2 ), overweight\n(BMI\u2009=\u200925.1\u201329.9\u2009kg/m 2 ), had other endocrine diseases (such as\ndiabetes or thyroid dysfunctions), received hormonal treatment before IVF, had\nrepeated miscarriages, used insulin sensitizers, or were diagnosed with\nendometriosis. Both PCOS-NORM and PCOS-OB patients underwent controlled ovarian\nstimulation using a GnRH antagonist combined with recombinant follicle\nstimulating hormone (FSH) (r-FSH) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection\n(ICSI).  Briefly, women started ovarian stimulation with 225\u2009IU of r-FSH (Gonal; Serono)\nbeginning on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. The GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix,\n0.25\u2009mg) was initiated when follicular size was 14\u2009mm in diameter or on day 7 of\novarian stimulation. The final oocyte maturation trigger was 250\u2009mcg human\nChorionic Gonadotropin (hCG, Ovidrel; Serono. Darmstadt, Germany) once at least\none follicle reached 20\u2009mm. Estradiol levels were below 3500\u2009pg/ml and there was\nno OHSS. Cumulus oocyte complexes were retrieved by vaginal puncture and guided\nby transvaginal ultrasound 35\u2009h after hCG administration.  Pooled cumulus oocyte complexes from each patient were collected in G-MOPS medium\n(3-N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid buffered medium, Vitrolife, Gothenburg,\nSweden), and CCs, which also include corona radiata cells, were mechanically\nstripped from oocytes under magnifying glass using two disposable needles and\ntwo 1-ml plastic disposable syringes without hyaluronidase. The number of CCs\ncollected was similar between groups. The mature oocytes were used for the ICSI\nprocedure, and pooled CCs from each patient were immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C in\nRNA for later analysis.    RNA isolation and gene expression analysis  Total RNA was isolated from CCs using the Trizol method (Trizol\u2122 reagent, Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. The RNA concentration and quality (260/280 ratio) were assessed\nusing a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000 instrument, Thermo Scientific,\nWhaltham, MA, USA). Then, 100\u2009ng of total RNA was used for reverse transcription\nto generate double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) using an RT 2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were performed\nto evaluate 84 genes related to the insulin signaling pathway (RT 2 Profiler\u2122 PCR Array Human Insulin Signaling Pathway\u2014PAHS-030ZC, Qiagen),\nand pre-designed assays were used to carry out quantitative PCR (7500 Real-Time\nPCR System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The specific pathway\nfunction for each gene is described in Supplemental Data 1 . The 96-well PCR array plates contain five\nhousekeeping genes (actin beta\u2014ACTB, beta-2-microglobulin\u2014B2M,\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\u2014GAPDH, hypoxanthine\nphosphoribosyltransferase-1\u2014HPRT1, ribosomal protein large P0\u2014RPLP0) and a panel\nof patented controls to monitor genomic DNA contamination, strand cDNA\nsynthesis, and real-time PCR efficiency. The PCR array plates were assayed using\na Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). We obtained cycle\nthreshold (Ct) values for the genes under investigation, and the \u0394\u0394Ct method was\nused for gene expression analysis using the PCR Array Data Analysis Web Portal\n( https://dataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php ).    Statistical analysis  All statistical analyses were performed considering n =\u20096 for\nobese group and n =\u20099 for normal weight group. Differences in\ngene expression were calculated by the delta Ct method by using the RT2\nProfiler PCR Data Analysis ( https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/ ).\nThe significance of the expression differences in the two groups was calculated\nusing Mann-Whitney U test. The results were expressed as fold\nup- or fold down-expression in PCOS-OB compared with that in PCOS-NORM. Genes\nthat had expression levels with a fold change (FC) of at least \u2a7e3 or \u2a7d3 and p \u2a7d\u20090.05 were considered differentially expressed (DE). The\nDE genes were analyzed using Advaita Bio\u2019s iPathwayGuide ( http://www.advaitabio.com/ipathwayguide ), and the significantly\nimpacted pathways, biological processes, and molecular functions were analyzed.\nTo detect the Gene Ontology (GO) categories that were over- or under-represented\nin the condition under study, we used Advaita Bio\u2019s iPathwayGuide, which uses an\nimpact analysis method that relies on classical statistics and also considers\nother key factors such as the magnitude of the expression change for each gene,\ntheir type and position on the given pathways, and their interactions. The Elim\npruning method, which iteratively removes the genes mapped to a significant GO\nterm from more general (higher level) GO terms, was used to overcome the\nlimitation of errors introduced by considering genes multiple times. The\nsettings used were as follows: log-FC\u2009=\u20090.6 and adjusted p value\u2009=\u20090.05.     Results   Patient characteristics  The patients\u2019 demographic and clinical profiles are described in Table 1 . Except for\nBMI, the demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups were similar.\nPatients were young, had good ovarian reserve demonstrated by basal FSH levels,\nand, after ovarian stimulation, had a high number of oocytes collected, as\nexpected for PCOS patients. In PCOS-NORM group, five patients presented two\nRotterdam criteria and four patients presented all three criteria. In PCOS-OB\ngroup, four patients presented two Rotterdam criteria and two patients presented\nall three criteria ( Supplemental Table 1 ). No OHSS occurred.   Table 1.

The general analysis of DE genes in PCOS-OB compared with those in PCOS-NORM\nwomen in the human insulin signaling pathway is presented in Figure 1 .

The analysis using Advaita Bio\u2019s iPathwayGuide combined enrichment\n(over-representation of DE genes) and pathway topology (structure and dynamics\nof the entire pathway) to calculate a perturbation value for each gene. In our\nstudy, six DE genes caused perturbation of the insulin signaling pathway ( Table 2 ). The\nperturbation in the pathway is highlighted in Figure 2 , where we note that enrichment\nof those genes is involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, protein synthesis, and\ncell proliferation/differentiation. Moreover, after eliminating pruning, we\nevaluated the biological processes related to DE genes in the PCOS-OB over\nPCOS-NORM groups. The overexpression of CBL and BRAF genes was associated with\nthe activation of calcium ion binding.   Figure 2.   Insulin signaling pathway.

Discussion  The PCOS is a complex multifactorial disorder with heterogeneous clinical\nfeatures. 22 , 23 The characterization of molecular markers in past years has\nidentified genes involved in insulin resistance, steroidogenesis, and follicle\ndevelopment as the primary dysfunctional factors in this syndrome. 24 Obesity is clearly a clinical condition associated with PCOS incidence, 7 usually related to hyperandrogenism. 22 , 25 Here, we mapped the insulin\nsignaling pathway in CCs from obese PCOS patients without clinical insulin\nresistance, as evaluated by HOMA IR, and non-obese PCOS patients. Our results\nsuggest that in the follicular environment, insulin resistance is transcriptionally\npresent even in the absence of clinical signs in obese PCOS patients.  In vivo and in vitro studies show that insulin\nenhances growth and differentiation of theca and granulosa cells in the ovary. 26 The CCs are a subtype of granulosa cells essential to oocyte maturation,\nwhich respond to the luteinizing hormone (LH) trigger prompting an increase in\ncalcium, which diffuses through gap junctions in a few minutes and into the oocyte,\nwhere a local amplification system spreads the signal all over the cell. 27 In addition, CCs are essential to cytoplasm maturation by promoting energetic\nmetabolism and converting glucose into pyruvate, which can be metabolized to allow\nthe oocyte to be fertilized, as well as early embryonic development. 28 , 29  The present study analyzed 84 pre-established genes related to the insulin signaling\npathway in CCs of PCOS-OB and PCOS-NORM patients. Among these genes, 11 were\nsignificantly upregulated in the PCOS-OB patients in relation to the gene expression\nin the PCOS-NORM patients. The bioinformatics approach showed that six genes caused\na perturbation in the insulin pathway (FBP1, SORBS1, CBL, BRAF, MTOR, and PCK2), and\nthree of these genes that had higher log-FC (FBP1, CBL, and PCK2) are involved in\nglucose homeostasis. Calcium ion binding was the molecular function that was\nhighlighted in the analysis. Calcium ion binding is also influenced by BRAF and CBL\ngenes and presented higher FC in PCOS-OB patients over PCOS-NORM patients.  Our findings highlighted the perturbation of glucose homeostasis in CCs in obese PCOS\npatients compared with that in normal weight PCOS patients. The main gene associated\nwith this function that was DE across groups was CBL. The function of CBL is related\nto insulin resistance induced by adipocytes in obese patients through inflammatory\nmechanisms. 30 , 31 In a study evaluating the protein profile of visceral adipose\ntissue, CBL was shown to be responsible for signaling and regulation of insulin\nsecretion, which was associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type II. 32 Considering the increased visceral adiposity in obese PCOS women and the\nrelationship with the pathogenesis and phenotype of PCOS, 33 overexpression of the CBL gene in CCs observed in obese women in our study\nsuggests that obesity can also affect the follicular environment and more\nspecifically the insulin pathway. We suggest that insulin resistance can be present\nin the follicular environment, even in patients who do not have clinical insulin\nresistance indicated by HOMA IR.  The BRAF gene is an oncogene responsible for the protein kinase serine-threonine,\nwhich is involved in the delivery of intracellular signals directly related to cell\nproliferation in the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. 34 The CBL and BRAF genes were upregulated and associated with calcium ion\nbinding in obese PCOS patients. Calcium oscillations are known to mediate a large\nnumber of physiological cell functions, including oocyte activation 35 \u2013 37 and mitotic\ncleavage. 38 , 39  The association of obesity and IVF outcomes is still controversial in the literature.\nSome authors believe that obesity is related to a worse prognosis, 40 and others have not shown clinical differences despite less favorable cycle characteristics. 41 Obese patients may have a more activated calcium ion binding process to\ncompensate for impairments in the micro-environment.  The oocyte uses pyruvate for cytoplasmic maturation, 29 , 42 which is also the substrate\nfor embryo metabolism during the initial development after fertilization. 43 , 44 The gene PCK2\ncodes for a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes oxalacetate in phosphoenolpyruvate\nin the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis, exacerbating the production of glucose\nthrough pyruvate. Animal studies have shown that PCK2 overexpression predisposes the\nanimal to obesity, and its knockout leads to hypoglycemia through Krebs cycle dysfunction. 45 Those data are in agreement with our findings as obese PCOS women have\nupregulated PCK2 such as FBP1, which codes for the fructose 1,6 diphosphatase enzyme\nand is responsible for gluconeogenesis. 46 Both genes are involved in glucose homeostasis perturbation.  Polymorphisms in SORBS1 (CBL associated protein \u2013 CAP) gene have been associated with\nobesity and insulin resistance. 47 , 48 In a study with the Korean\npopulation, SORBS1 polymorphism was also related with PCOS. 49 Moreover, in a comprehensive proteomic analysis, SORBS1 is upregulated in\nvisceral adipose tissue from type 2 diabetes patients. 32 In the insulin signaling pathway, SORBS1 acts as CBL-adaptor protein. When\ninsulin binds to its receptor (IR), CBL is recruited by interaction with SORBS1 and,\nupon phosphorylation, dissociates from IR and migrates to plasma membrane. This\ncomplex is involved in GLUT4 translocation to cell membrane, which may interfere on\nglucose uptake. 32 The interaction of CBL and SORBS1 (CAP) with GLUT4 is illustrated in Figure 2 . In our study, CBL\nand SORBS1 are increased in obese patients, which may reflect in glucose uptake in\ngranulosa cells, leading to important cellular metabolism dysfunction.  It could be speculated whether these deregulated genes and the consequent\nperturbation of glucose homeostasis in the CCs may be associated with the oocyte\nmaturation deficiency observed in obese PCOS patients, 50 because the biochemical characteristics of the micro-environment of oocyte\ndevelopment (follicular fluid, CCs, and oocytes) play a critical role in determining\noocyte quality and the subsequent potential to achieve fertilization and embryo development. 51 Thus, the alterations observed in our study may not only reflect the\nmetabolism status of CCs but are supposedly associated with the damage to oocyte\ndevelopment observed in PCOS obese patients.  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a conserved serine/threonine protein\nkinase, promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by the\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. 52 The insulin-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling induces p70S6K\nexpression and increases S6BP and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, which promotes protein\nsynthesis ( Figure 2 ). The\nunbalance of this pathway is associated with impairment of follicular development\nand ovulation abnormalities, such as reduction of follicular growth and granulosa\ncell proliferation. 52 Furthermore, the overexpression of the mTOR pathway can lead to insulin\nresistance, which is an important pathophysiological basis of PCOS.  The limitations of the study include low number of patients and the absence of\nfollow-up, which could be helpful to understand whether the follicular state\nmodification is a prodrome to clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. The\ncharacteristic of this study limits the translation of our results to change the\ncurrent medical practice, but highlights the need of attention on obese PCOS\npatients without clinical insulin resistance on how possible changes in follicular\nenvironment could affect clinical outcomes. Another point to be emphasized is that\nour study does not exclude the possibility that the same insulin signaling pathway\nalterations could not affect obese women without PCOS, due to the lack of an\nobese-control group without PCOS in our study. The aim of this study was not to\ncompare the reproductive outcomes between the groups, because there is no\nstatistical power for such analysis with our sample size, neither an adequate\ninclusion nor exclusion criterion to suggest that only the obesity factor, in\nassociation or not with PCOS, could be a determining factor.  In conclusion, a number of genes in the insulin signaling pathway that are involved\nin glucose homeostasis and calcium binding processes in the follicular environment\nare upregulated in PCOS obese women who do not have clinical insulin resistance.\nTogether, our findings and the related literature suggest that those alterations may\nbe associated with the worse prognosis of follicular development and oocyte\nmaturation observed in PCOS obese women.
