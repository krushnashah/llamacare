    "abstract": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a kind of endocrine disorder which is prevalent in adult women, so exploring more biomarkers for PCOS is imperative. Recently, circular RNA and microRNA are confirmed to be related with PCOS development. Whether circular RNA ASPH (circASPH) is involved in PCOS need to be studied further. We utilized RT\u2010qPCR to measure the expression levels of circASPH, miR\u2010375 and MAP2K6 in PCOS patients and normal group. The effects of circASPH and miR\u2010375 on KGN cells proliferation and apoptosis were observed by CCK\u20108 assay, EdU incorporation assay and apoptosis assay, separately. Then Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay was carried out to verify the circASPH/miR375 axis and miR375/MAP2K6 axis. The interaction between circASPH and MAP2K6 were detected with the support of RT\u2010qPCR and Western blot. We found circASPH and MAP2K6 were both over\u2010expressed in PCOS patients, while miR\u2010375 was in the opposite direction. Moreover, miR\u2010375 was negatively regulated by circASPH, while MAP2K6 was positively regulated by circASPH. In addition, circASPH directly targeted miR\u2010375, which targeted MAP2K6. More than that, the knockdown of circASPH repressed KGN cells proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, while the silence of miR\u2010375 reversed the above effects. In conclusion, circASPH promotes KGN cells proliferation through miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 axis in PCOS, and they are thought\u2010provoking biomarkers for PCOS diagnosis and therapy.",
    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most regular endocrine disorder in adult women with the occurrence of 6%\u201012% in overall women.  1  Clinical characteristics are multifarious, mainly manifested as hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, ovarian polycystic changes, anovulation, infertility and so on. The women who was affected with PCOS usually have an additive risk suffering from type II diabetes mellitus, metabolic diseases, hypertension and cardiovascular events, and so on.  2  ,  3  ,  4  In addition, the risk of suffering from PCOS could be increased by obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension.  4  ,  5  As a syndrome, the pathogenesis of PCOS is complicated and the studies are always underway for discovering diagnosis and treatment approach. Due to the development of high\u2010throughput sequencing technologies, regulatory genes participating in the pathogenesis of PCOS have been discovered successively in previous studies.  6  ,  7    Circular RNA is a class of endogenous, single\u2010strand, circular non\u2010coding RNA without 5\u2032\u20103\u2032 polarity, and it is the byproduct of wrong\u2010splicing of precursor mRNA (pre\u2010mRNA) in eukaryotes. Circular RNA have been certificated to regulate gene in transcriptional or post\u2010transcriptional level by sponging microRNA mainly and play vital roles in a series of physiological processes.  8  ,  9  ,  10  Recently, the studies focused on the effects of circular RNA in PCOS development are growing vigorously, hundreds of circular RNA have been found dysregulated in PCOS model.  11  ,  12  ,  13  Moreover, the detailed regulatory effects of circular RNA have also been excavated, such as circ_0023942 exerted as a negative role in ovarian granulosa cell proliferation.  14  Earlier, circASPH was reported to act as a tumour\u2010promotor through targeting miR\u2010370/HMGA2 axis in lung adenocarcinoma,  15  however, the potential role of circASPH in PCOS is still unclear.  As the commonest gene regulating factor, microRNAs have also been considered in the pathological of PCOS, and many microRNAs were investigated to be correlated with PCOS [5\u20101,5\u20105]. Further, miR\u201019b, miR\u2010145, miR\u201029a, miR\u2010204 were all validated to be a negative regulator in PCOS cell proliferation.  16  ,  17  ,  18  ,  19  Meanwhile, several circRNA/miRNA axis were pointed out, including circ\u2010PUM1/miR\u2010760 and circ_0118530/miR\u2010136.  20  ,  21  The knowledge of circASPH sponged microRNA in PCOS development is still lacking.  In our study, we speculated that circASPH is crucial in the processes of PCOS. First, the experiment results showed that circASPH was up\u2010regulated in PCOS. Then, bioinformatic analysis was applied to predict the downstream regulator of circASPH and miR\u2010375 was one of the miRNA response elements. Moreover, we found that the up\u2010regulation of circASPH enhanced KGN cells proliferation through targeting miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 axis. Our findings partially demonstrate the role of circASPH/miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 axis in PCOS, which may be helpful for PCOS clinical diagnose and therapy.    2  METHODS   2.1  Clinical samples  Five patients with PCOS were enrolled from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Nine women without PCOS at the similar age as that of PCOS patients were gathered as the normal control group. The diagnosis of PCOS is established by the presence of at least two out of three of the following criteria: (1) signs of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (2) chronic ovulatory dysfunction and (3) polycystic ovarian morphology. All patients offered the written informed consent of the following study, and all the experiments followed by the local ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Ovarian granulosa cells were obtained from all 14 samples using follicular aspiration of mature oocytes. The clear follicular fluid containing granulosa cells was collected and centrifuged at 626 g for 10\u00a0minutes. The cells were resuspended in hyaluronidase and digested at 37\u00b0C for 20\u00a0minutes. Next, we added lymphocyte separation liquid and centrifuged at 626 g for 10\u00a0minutes. The intermediate white cloudy cell clusters were granulosa cells.    2.2  Cells culture and transfection  KGN and SVOG cells (GC cell line) were bought from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). All cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% gentamicin, and all cells were incubated under a 5% CO 2 , humidified atmosphere and 37\u00b0C condition. All plasmids, si RNAs and their negative controls purchased from GeneChem (Shanghai, China), were transfected using lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) followed by the manufacturer's instructions.    2.3  RT\u2010qPCR  Total RNA were lysed from ovarian granulosa cells and GC cells with the help of Trizol abided by the protocol. Then RNAs were reverse\u2010transcript into cDNA using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (TaKaRa, Japan). GAPDH was acted as an internal control. Target RNAs were amplified on 7500 Real\u2010Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, USA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. The values were determined by using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.    2.4  Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay  The circASPH WT, MAP2K6 WT and their MUT plasmids were constructed by GeneChem (Shanghai, China). The plasmids contained circASPH WT and circASPH MUT along with miR\u2010375 mimic and their negative controls, MAP2K6 WT and MAP2K6 MUT along with miR\u2010375 mimic and their negative controls, MAP2K6 WT and MAP2K6 MUT along with OE circASPH and their negative controls, were co\u2010transfected into KGN cells separately. Finally, we used Dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay Kit (Promega) to observe the luciferase reporter activity.    2.5  CCK\u20108 assay  Cell Counting Kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108) assay was employed to measure the proliferation ability of GC cells. We used CCK\u20108 solution to count the cell numbers at 450\u00a0nm following the protocol. The data were gathered every 24\u00a0hours from 0 to 96\u00a0hours respectively.    2.6  EdU assay  A Cell\u2010Light EdU DNA Cell proliferation Kit (RiboBio, China) was used to test the cell proliferation. After KGN cells transfected with OE circASPH, OE NC, si circASPH and si NC for 2\u00a0days, EdU were added for 48\u00a0hours. Then the cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained by Apollo Dye Solution. Nucleic acids were stained by DAPI. A fluorescence microscope and Image\u2010Pro Plus software were utilized to take images and assess cells EdU incorporation.    2.7  Apoptosis assay  Propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V\u2010conjugated Fluorescein isothiocynate (Annexin V\u2010FITC) were used to assess the apoptotic cells rate. Transfected KGN cells were cultured with PI and Annexin V\u2010FITC for 20\u00a0minutes without light. Cell apoptosis was assessed with the help of Flow cytometry (FC). The data of apoptotic cells rate were measured by FlowJo software (Tree Star, USA).    2.8  Western blot  Transfected KGN cells with OE circASPH, OE NC, si circASPH, and si NC were lysed using RIPA buffer to obtain proteins, which were separated via 10% SDS\u2010PAGE gels and then moved to PVDF membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). After blocking the above membranes in 5% dried skim milk at 25\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hour, the membranes were indicated with specific primary antibodies (MAP2K6, ab154901; Cleaved PARP, ab32064, Cleaved Caspase 3, ab32042; GAPDH, ab9485) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with TBST three times and the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2\u00a0hours at 25\u00b0C. All antibodies used were purchased from Abcam (USA). We used a BCA Protein Quantitation Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) to quantify proteins.    2.9  Statistical analysis  All data were exhibited as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD) and were the average of three experiments. We carried out Student's t test and one\u2010way ANOVA analysis to measure the differences between quantitative variables. All statistical analysis were performed with the help of R studio (3.6.1). A two\u2010tailed P \u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered to be statistically significant.     3  RESULTS   3.1  CircASPH was over\u2010expressed, while miR\u2010375 was down\u2010regulated in PCOS  By a Starbase v2.0 prediction, circASPH shared potential miRNA response elements for multiple miRNAs such as miR\u20101182, miR\u20101236, miR\u2010370 and miR\u2010375. RT\u2010qPCR was employed to verify whether circASPH and miR\u2010375 were dysregulated in PCOS patients. The RT\u2010qPCR results indicated that the expression level of circASPH in PCOS patients was obviously higher than that in control group (Figure 1A ). However, the expression level of miR\u2010375 in PCOS patients was obviously lower than that in control group (Figure 1B ). In addition, the linear regression between circASPH expression and miR\u2010375 expression in PCOS patients showed that the circASPH expression and miR\u2010375 expression was correlated negatively significantly with the p\u2010value 0.033 (Figure 1C ). Taken together, circASPH was over\u2010expressed, while miR\u2010375 was down\u2010regulated in PCOS. More than that, circASPH and miR\u2010375 was correlated negatively.

The expression level of circASPH in KGN and SVOG cells transfected with si circASPH\u20101 or si circASPH\u20102 was significantly lower than that transfected with si NC (Figure 1D and F ). The cell viability of KGN and SVOG cells transfected with si circASPH\u20101 or si circASPH\u20102 was significantly lower than that transfected with si NC (Figure 1E and G ). The expression level of circASPH in KGN cells transfected with OE circASPH was significantly higher than that transfected with OE NC and the expression level of circASPH in KGN cells transfected with si circASPH was significantly lower than that transfected with si NC (Figure 2A ). CCK\u20108 assay results manifested that the cell viability of KGN cells transfected with OE circASPH was significantly higher than that transfected with OE NC and the cell viability of KGN cells transfected with si circASPH was significantly lower than that transfected with si NC (Figure 2B ). The EdU assay results showed that the EdU incorporation of KGN cells transfected with OE circASPH was significantly higher than that transfected with OE NC and the Edu incorporation of KGN cells transfected with si circASPH was significantly lower than that transfected with si NC (Figure 2C and D ). Apoptosis assay results manifested that the cell apoptotic rate of KGN cells transfected with OE circASPH was significantly lower than that transfected with OE NC and the cell apoptotic rate of KGN cells transfected with si circASPH was significantly higher than that transfected with si NC (Figure 2E and F ). Western blot analysis data revealed that the overexpression of circASPH significantly decreased the protein levels of the cleaved form of PARP and cleaved caspase 3 and silencing of circASPH significantly increased the protein levels of the cleaved form of PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 2G, H and I ). Taken together, overexpression of circASPH promoted KGN cells proliferation and inhibited KGN cells apoptosis, while silencing of circASPH repressed KGN cells proliferation and enhanced KGN cells apoptosis.

CCK\u20108 assay results showed that the cell viability in KGN cells transfected with si circASPH\u00a0+\u00a0miR\u2010375 inhibitor was higher than that transfected with circASPH\u00a0+\u00a0inhibitor NC, which was identical with the si circASPH group (Figure 3D ). Apoptosis assay results manifested that the cell apoptotic rate in KGN cells transfected with si circASPH\u00a0+\u00a0miR\u2010375 inhibitor was lower than that transfected with circASPH\u00a0+\u00a0inhibitor NC, which was identical with the si circASPH group (Figure 3E and F ). Western blot analysis data revealed that the miR\u2010375 inhibition significantly decreased the protein levels of the cleaved form of PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 3G, H and I ). Our findings showed that miR\u2010375 was negatively regulated and could bind with circASPH, miR\u2010375 overturned the inhibition effect of circASPH silencing on KGN cells proliferation, and the promotion effect of circASPH silencing on KGN cells apoptosis.

Circular RNA have been studied to be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and ceRNA network including the sponged microRNA or its target gene were also explored in PCOS Lu et al found CIRS\u2010126/miR\u201021/PDCD4 axis was correlated with ovarian granulosa cells.  22  Huang et al elucidated that circLDLR/miR\u20101294/CYP19A1 was observed in follicle fluid.  23    In our study, we used the human granulosa\u2010like tumour KGN cell line to study PCOS pathology. There were three reasons why we used KGN cells. First, it is difficult to obtain human ovarian granulosa cells in sizable amounts. Second, the primary culture system of human ovarian granulosa cells is hard to maintain. Third, KGN cells express functional follicle\u2010stimulating hormone receptors (FSHRs) and have steroidogenic activities similar to human ovarian granulosa cells.  24  ,  25  We focused on the effects of circASPH in PCOS and circASPH was up\u2010regulated in PCOS. Silencing of circASPH repressed KGN cells proliferation and enhanced KGN cells apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that circASPH plays an oncogenic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. In addition, miR\u2010375 was certificated to be targeted by circASPH, and reversed the inhibition effect of circASPH silencing on KGN cells proliferation. Moreover, MAP2K6 was found to be the downstream gene of miR\u2010375 and was interacted with circASPH positively. In conclusion, the circASPH/miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 ceRNA network in PCOS was concluded in our study.  CircASPH originated from circularization of the aspartate beta\u2010hydroxylase (ASPH) gene, which is located at exon 4 to exon 14, was first to be studied in lung adenocarcinoma, and it was overexpressed and regulated by HMGA2.  15  More than that, circASPH promoted tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion. By sponging miR\u2010370, circASPH modulated HMGA2 expression conversely, and served as oncogenic role through HMGA2/circASPH/miR\u2010370 axis.  15  In our study, circASPH was also up\u2010regulated in PCOS patients, and enhanced KGN cells proliferation and inhibited KGN cells apoptosis. We found that miR\u2010375 was identified to be the sponging microRNA in KGN cells.  Based on the previous studies, miR\u2010375 have proved to be a tumour suppressor in various type of cancers essentially. MiR\u2010375 repressed nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells proliferation and invasion thorough targeting PDK1.  26  In cervical cancer, miR\u2010375 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion by interacting with AEG\u20101.  27  Overexpression of miR\u2010375 inhibited cell colony formation and invasion in 5\u2010FU\u2010resistant colorectal cancer cells by targeting FOXMI.  28  Concerned to liver cancer, up\u2010regulated miR\u2010375 repressed cell growth via interacting with the downstream gene ErbB2.  29  In gastrointestinal stromal tumour, overexpressed miR\u2010375\u20103p attenuated cell viability and migration rate.  30  In our study, miR\u2010375 was found to be sponged by circASPH and target MAP2K6, and the silencing of miR\u2010375 restrained PCOS development by interacting with circASPH.  Mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase 6 (MAP2K6) is a kind of protein kinases, belongs to MAP kinases (MAPKs) family, which contributes to cellular metabolism, cell transport, cell signalling, cell division, protein regulation and so on.  31  ,  32  According to engaged studies, MAP2K6 was crucial to tumour cell growth, division and inflammation response.  33  In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, MAP2K6 was associated with LIFR\u2010caused radioresistance.  34  MAP2K6 was targeted by circ_016719/miR\u201029c axis in neuron cell apoptosis caused by I/R.  35  With regard to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, depleting of MAP2K6 restrained tumour cell growth.  36  MAP2K6/p38 signalling pathway was involved in the colorectal adenocarcinoma targeted by miR\u2010625\u20103p.  37  In research of PCOS, MAP2K6 had already been mentioned. Nilsson et al pointed out that MAP2K6 was abnormally expressed in skeletal muscle of women with PCOS and normal group.  38  Our study found the detailed role of MAP2K6 in PCOS. Concretely, MAP2K6 was verified to be targeted by miR\u2010375 and interacted with circASPH positively in KGN cells.  In general, our study revealed the oncogenic effects of circASPH in PCOS. Meanwhile, miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 axis was the downstream of circASPH. A ceRNA network circASPH/miR\u2010375/MAP2K6 was established in PCOS model, this will be an influential event for PCOS clinical diagnose and therapy.
