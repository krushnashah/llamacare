    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the underdiagnosed and underrated medical conditions that affect women around the world. PCOS is a heterogeneous condition that causes intense endocrine and reproductive malfunction. It commonly affects women of reproductive age in the range of 18\u201344 years. The gross effects of this condition can lead to hormonal complexities, such as dysfunctional menstrual cycles that may lead to infertility, obesity, hirsutism, and acne. The diagnosis of PCOS is performed following the Rotterdam Criteria and the Androgen Excess Society Criteria  1  . Furthermore, PCOS is associated with metabolic abnormalities as well as obesity  2 , 3  . However, management of this syndrome varies based on observable symptoms. PCOS is usually not diagnosed unless the patient encounters other related medical challenges, such as alopecia, hirsutism, androgenic acne, or infertility  4  .  PCOS is shown to be clustered in families. Numerous studies are carried out to identify the ultimate etiology and the genetic background of PCOS  5  . However, the molecular regulation of this disease is not well understood. All the genes that function in oogenesis and ovulation may have a role in the development of PCOS. Some of these genes are the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor ( LHCGR ), estrogen receptor ( ER ), and androgen receptor ( AR ). In addition to these genes involved in gametogenesis, genes involved in insulin homeostasis, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 ( IRS1 ) and insulin receptor ( INSR ), contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS  6  . Furthermore, recent studies revealed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be important for evaluating PCOS susceptibility. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the allelic frequencies of SNPs within genes associated with PCOS.    METHODS   Sample collection  Ethical approval was granted by the Institution Review Board of Near East University (YDU/2019/67-784). The samples required for this study were obtained from patients of Near East University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Clinical information of the patient was collected, and body mass indexes were reported. The samples to be studied were divided into two groups: the control group consisting of normal ovulation and non-obese women, and the patient group involving non-obese patients with PCOS. Blood samples were collected from 55 women in the control group and from 65 women included in the patient group. DNA from whole blood was obtained. The allelic frequencies of SNPs in two genes associated with PCOS were determined using real-time PCR.    DNA extraction from blood samples  DNA from each sample was extracted using an Invitrogen pure link genomic DNA mini kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of the DNA was measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburg, USA) at a wavelength of 260 nm (OD 260 ). The purity and quality were evaluated by the 230/260 ratio.    PCR amplification  Real-time PCR was conducted in order to identify the allelic frequencies at the particular SNP sites of the polymorphic genes, IRS1 and INSR , which are associated with PCOS. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1 . The reaction mixture consisted of 5 \u03bcl of master mix (LightCycler 480 SYBR Green, Roche), 0.8 \u03bcl of both forward and reverse primer ( Table 1 , final concentration of 0.25 \u03bcM), 0.6 \u03bcl of MgCl 2 , and 0.8 \u03bcl of H 2 O were included in the reaction mixture. A volume of 2 \u03bcl of the extracted DNA was added to each reaction. All the PCRs were set up in a laminar flow hood in order to avoid contamination. The PCR condition is shown in Table 2 . The allelic frequencies of the two SNPs within two genes were analyzed using the high-resolution melting (HRM) method, and the thermal cycler software was used to obtain the cycle of threshold (Ct) and melting temperature (Tm) values.

Descriptive statistics and an independent sample test of the Mann-Whitney U test were performed. The results were considered statistically significant if p\u22640.05.     RESULTS  This study was designed to investigate the allelic frequencies for the polymorphic variant genes that are associated with PCOS. A total number of 120 blood samples were collected. Of these, 65 were diagnosed with PCOS and 55 were included in the control group, who did not present any signs of PCOS. The average age was 20 years and the average body mass index for all the patients and the control group was 17. The PCOS patients were diagnosed by correcting their hormonal levels as well as by vaginal ultrasonography.  For each amplification, the cycle of threshold (Ct) was recorded. Ct indicates the total amount of cycle required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold. Likewise, for each amplification, melting temperature (Tm) values were recorded. Tm represents the melting temperature when the DNA is 50% double-stranded and 50% single-stranded. In HRM analysis, following PCR amplification, the amplicons produced are subjected to a gradual melting analysis. This enables the emission of fluorescence that is detected by real-time PCR equipment. These melt curves have different shapes due to the differences in the Tm values.  In this study, a total of 79.3% of the patients were shown to be homozygous for IRS1 rs1801278 , respectively ( Figure 1 , Tables 3 and 4 ). There was no significant difference between the homozygote and heterozygote status of IRS1 rs1801278 when the patient group was compared with the control group. Furthermore, the heterozygosity of INSR rs1799817 did not show any significant difference between the patient group and the control group (p=0.059, Tables 3 and 4 ).

PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility. Genetic and environmental factors tend to influence the complexity of PCOS ( Figure 2 ). A number of studies have shown that genes and proteins are overexpressed or underexpressed in samples from PCOS patients. One of the examples of these is the androgen receptors that have been shown to be overexpressed in the endometrial samples obtained from PCOS patients. Furthermore, MKI67, BCL2/BAX, and FASLG/FAS were overexpressed in endometrium samples of PCOS patients. Moreover, these expression patterns were positively correlated with the levels of fasting insulin and negatively correlated with the levels of DHEA-S. Thus, endometrial homeostasis is associated with the levels of fasting insulin and DHEA-S that can also be correlated with the expression of the mentioned proteins  7  . Studies have shown that PCOS patients have high resistance to insulin. Insulin receptor genes, such as IRS1 and INSR , are among the key genes that can be associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS. IRS1 and INSR polymorphisms have tendencies to participate in problems with insulin signaling  8  . In this study, we aimed to investigate the heterozygosity status of two SNPs within IRS1 and INSR genes that may have an increased risk of PCOS.   Figure 2   Flowchart diagram of causes of polycystic ovary syndrome.     In this study, the homozygosity and heterozygosity status of the SNPs within IRS1 and INSR genes were analyzed using Tm. The statistical differences were investigated using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results of this study showed that the heterozygosity and homozygosity status of INSR showed no significant difference between the control and patient groups. Similarly, another study reported no significant differences between the SNPs investigated within the IRS1 and INSR genes in 48 Iranian women diagnosed with PCOS and 52 women in the control group. Furthermore, the same research group reported no association of IRS1 polymorphism in PCOS patients and controls in Spain  9  . Similarly, genome-wide association studies have failed to show the link between the polymorphism of IRS1 and PCOS in Han Chinese population  10  . Moreover, further studies reported no association between SNPs within INS , INSR , IRS1 , IRS2 , PPAR-G , and CAPN10 genes and PCOS  11  .  In contrast, one study reported significantly different frequencies of IRS1 Gly972Arg polymorphism in PCOS and the control subjects in Turkish population  12  . Furthermore, another study was conducted to determine the frequency of polymorphism for the IRS1 at codon 972 in women with PCOS in South Italy, consisting of 65 women with PCOS and 27 age-matched healthy women. They reported that there was a significant difference in the frequencies of Gly972Arg present in PCOS patients compared to controls. Furthermore, Tang et al. performed a comprehensive meta-analysis consisting of more than 4,000 subjects and reported that the AA/GA genotype of IRS1 rs1801278 increased the susceptibility of PCOS when compared to the homozygote GG genotype. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Ruan et al. reported that the presence of the A allele significantly increased the risk of PCOS. They further recorded no significant association observed in the IRS2 Gly1057Asp polymorphism  13  .  Further studies also investigated the genotypes of INSR rs1799817 in relation to susceptibility of PCOS in Saudi Arabia, reporting that the homozygous allele was significantly higher compared to the control group  14  . Similarly, Chen et al.  15  also reported a significant difference in INSR rs1799817 genotypes in nonobese patients with PCOS compared to the controls.    CONCLUSION  Allelic frequencies of genes IRS1 rs1801278 and INSR rs1799817 involved in PCOS recorded no significant difference in the study population. One of the limitations of this study was the small sample size. It is a possibility that, with the increased number of PCOS patients and control group, the heterozygosity status may have shown significant differences. Furthermore, we were able to only analyze a small number of polymorphisms. It would have been ideal to have a genome-wide investigation using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. However, the results of this study are crucial to associate the insulin-related genetic polymorphisms with the PCOS patients. Furthermore, one of the most important strengths of this study was the statistical analysis techniques used. The results of this study form the basis of future studies, especially in newly developed countries where newer technologies such as NGS are out of reach.",
