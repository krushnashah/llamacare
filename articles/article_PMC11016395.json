    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent disorder affecting a significant proportion of reproductive\u2010age women, typically between 4 and 21%. The condition is characterized by hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and either infrequent or absent ovulation, and it primarily manifests as an endocrine and metabolic imbalance (Xie et\u00a0al., 2019 ). The pathogenesis of PCOS has been suggested to be multifactorial, involving the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian (HPO) axis dysfunction, obesity, insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress, ovarian fibrosis, lipid imbalance, and genetic defects (Anagnostis et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Bhati et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  The existing evidence thus far indicates that women with PCOS frequently demonstrate ovarian fibrosis, which is intrinsic to infertility and is considered one of the primary features (Kakoly et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Oxidative stress\u2010induced ovarian damage can trigger ovarian fibrosis (Khaje Roshanaee et\u00a0al., 2022 ), consequently contributing to physiological disturbances such as menstrual abnormalities and reproductive disturbances (Ainehchi et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Shokoohi et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Recent research has suggested that women with PCOS and ovulatory dysfunction may have an increase in the production of extracellular matrix (ECM), which can lead to interstitial fibrosis, a thickening of the capsule, and a thickening of the basement membrane (Zych et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Individuals diagnosed with PCOS have high levels of transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 (TGF\u2010\u03b21) in their blood (Takahashi et\u00a0al., 2017 ). TGF\u2010\u03b21 is a multifunctional cytokine that activates Smad proteins and promotes fibrosis in many kinds of organs and tissues (Yang et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Activation of transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGF\u2010\u03b2R1) leads to the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which are subsequently joined with Smad4 and translocated to the nucleus (Wang, Li, et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Furthermore, it has been widely accepted that peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 (PPAR\u2010\u03b3) influences the inflammatory response in the ovaries of PCOS patients (Prabhu & Valsala Gopalakrishnan, 2020 ). Studies have indicated that PPAR\u2010\u03b3 has a powerful antifibrotic action, impacting myofibroblasts, restraining the expression of fibrosis factors, and obstructing the activation of TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smads (Prabhu & Valsala Gopalakrishnan, 2020 ). Blockade of TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smads\u2019 activation can effectively improve tissue and organ fibrosis (Gy\u00f6rfi et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Treatment of PCOS patients using conventional insulin\u2010sensitizing medications has been linked to a variety of adverse effects, including gastrointestinal problems, lactic acidosis, and renal insufficiency (Lashen, 2010 ). It is therefore vital that new alternative therapies for the treatment of PCOS with minimal side effects are available and under investigation. Plant\u2010derived phenolic compounds have been extensively utilized to ameliorate female reproductive and metabolic issues due to their capacity to scavenge free radicals and provide chemoprotection (Jahan et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Sinapic acid (SA) is a well\u2010known polyphenol found in several herbs (such as borage, sage, mace, and rosemary), fruits (such as strawberries, lemons, blueberries, kiwi, plums, cherries, and apples), cereals (oats), and some vegetables (such as kale, broccoli, and turnips) in the Brassicaceae family (Bin Jardan et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Zare et\u00a0al., 2015 ). Some pharmacological investigations have reported that SA has antioxidant, antianxiety, anticolitis, anticancer cell growth, intestinal barrier maintenance, anti\u2010inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antifibrotic (liver and lung), antihypertensive, and antimicrobial activities and improves lipid metabolism (Jabbar et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Lan et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Qian et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2021 ). This study intends to assess SA's impact on ovarian fibrosis in rats with PCOS, as the efficacy of SA in preventing ovarian fibrosis has not yet been explored.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Chemical reagents  Metformin (Met, purity >98%), SA (CAS No.: 530\u201059\u20106, purity >98%), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and letrozole were received from Topscience Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and other primary antibodies (Smad2, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), p\u2010Smad2, TGF\u2010\u03b21, Smad7, Smad3, and p\u2010Smad3) were received from Beyotime Biotech Inc (Shanghai, China). Papanicolaou staining solution and primary antibodies (collagen I, PPAR\u2010\u03b3, \u03b2\u2010actin, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2010SMA), Smad4, and TGF\u2010\u03b2R1) were provided by Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China).    2.2  In vivo experimental design and animal grouping  Hunan SJA Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. (Changsha, China) supplied six\u2010week\u2010old Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats (female, 190\u2013210\u2009g). All animals were fed AIN\u201093G diets and provided water in a sun protection factor (SPF) environment (23\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C, 12\u2009h of light and 12\u2009h of darkness). After adaptation, all animals were randomly divided intofour groups (eight rats/group) as follows: the normal rats were gavaged with CMC (1%); the PCOS rats were gavaged with letrozole (1\u2009mg/kg) suspension; the SA\u2010treated PCOS rats were gavaged with letrozole (1\u2009mg/kg)\u2009+\u2009SA (50\u2009mg/kg); and the Met\u2010treated PCOS rats were gavaged with letrozole (1\u2009mg/kg)\u2009+\u2009Met (265\u2009mg/kg). SA and Met were both dissolved in 1% CMC, and the experiment was conducted for a total of 21\u2009days (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021 ). The investigation method of this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Guilin Medical University (review code: GLMC\u2010201806003).    2.3  Estrus cycle detection for a papanicolaou staining assay  The detection of the estrous cycle was performed using a protocol reported in our previous studies (Chen, 2016 ; Shin et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Vaginal smears were performed on rats for eight consecutive days starting on the 10th day of dosing. A swab soaked with saline was placed clockwise into the rat's vagina and then applied to a slide and stained with Papanicolaou stain to observe changes in the estrous cycle by microscopy.    2.4  Blood collection and oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT )  All animals were fasted for 12\u2009h prior to being anesthetized with Zoletil 50 (50\u2009mg/kg; Virbac Laboratories, Carros, France), after which blood samples were obtained for the fasting blood glucose (FBG), OGTT, and insulin resistance (IR) assays. Glucose (2\u2009g/kg BW) was administered orally using a gastric tube, and blood glucose was subsequently assessed after 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120\u2009min using a kit (Beyotime) to determine the levels of FGB and glucose load. Glucose tolerance is expressed as a function of the area under the OGTT curve (area under the curve (AUC)) and the postload glucose responses (Adeyanju et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Additional blood samples (5\u2009mL) were collected from the inferior vena cava into vacuum blood collection tubes (Solarbio) and centrifuged (3000\u2009\u00d7 g , 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C) using a D1524R high\u2010speed refrigerated centrifuge (DLAB Scientific Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) to separate the serum and determine the IR levels (Guerrero\u2010Romero et\u00a0al., 2010 ).    2.5  Determination of sex hormones and lipid concentrations in serum  The serum concentrations of sex hormones (i.e., rat luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), follicle\u2010stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone (T)) were detected by colorimetry kits (Jiangsu Meimian Industrial Co. Ltd., Jiangsu, China). The serum levels of lipid profiles, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by the corresponding colorimetry kits provided by Beyotime.    2.6  Histopathologic observation of the ovaries  The ovaries and periuterine fat were fixed with a reagent (4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)) for 24\u2009h and embedded in paraffin. All ovarian sections (5\u2010\u03bcm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson trichrome staining solution (Servicebio) and observed using an Olympus CX31 microscope (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). For each group, the numbers of corpora lutea (CLs) and primary, secondary, antral follicles, atretic follicles (ATFs), and cystic follicles (CFs) per ovary were counted. The primary follicle was identified by the iso\u2010 to highly prismatic structure of the follicular epithelium that enveloped the oocyte. The presence of a secondary follicle was indicated by small fluid\u2010filled cavities among the granulosum cells. The classification of an antral follicle (AF) was determined by the presence of a follicle with two or more layers of cuboidal granulosa cells (GCs) and the visibility of the cavity. AF included follicles containing degenerating ova or pyknotic GCs. Follicles with large fluid\u2010filled structures and attenuated granulosa cell layers (GCLs), along with thickened theca interna cell layers, were accepted as CFs.  Following fixation of the other ovarian portions in 5% glutaraldehyde, a routine method, which included 1% osmium tetroxide, was used to prepare them for electron microscopic examination. The ultrathin sections were cut to a thickness of 50\u2009nm with a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and then double\u2010stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate before being observed using an HT7700 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High\u2010Technologies Corporation, Japan).    2.7  Collecting total RNA and quantitative real\u2010time ( qRT ) PCR assay  The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the target genes were assessed with a qRT\u2010PCR Kit (T2210; Solarbio, China) using a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real\u2010Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression level was calculated according to the 2 \u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method described under the same conditions in our previous report (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021 ).    2.8  Western blot analysis  One ovary (approximately 40\u2009mg) was ground in a KZ\u2010II High\u2010throughput tissue grinder (Servicebio), after which the total protein was extracted. The well\u2010boiled protein samples were separated by 10% or 12% BeyoGel\u2122 Plus Precast Tris\u2010Gly PAGE Gel (Beyotime). Then, they were blocked with QuickBlock\u2122 buffer (Beyotime) for 15\u2009min, incubated with primary antibodies (collagen I, p\u2010Smad2, Smad2, CTGF, TGF\u2010\u03b21, p\u2010Smad3, Smad3, PPAR\u2010\u03b3, \u03b2\u2010actin, Smad4, \u03b1\u2010SMA, and Smad7) for 3.5\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with antirabbit IgG for 90\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, all bands were observed in the FluorChem M System (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA) after reaction with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit, and bands were analyzed for grayscale using ImageJ ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ , NIH Image, Bethesda, MD, USA).    2.9  Immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining assay  The previously processed ovarian sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, sealed with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) (3%) to block endogenous peroxidase for 30\u2009min, placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) repair solution for antigen repair for 30\u2009min, and then blocked using 10% goat serum for 15\u2009min before being incubated with TGF\u2010\u03b21, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 primary antibodies. Then, all sections were washed and incubated with secondary antibody. They were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2010\u2013streptavidin (Beyotime) at 37\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. All sections were incubated with 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution, rinsed in tap water, and observed under a microscope. A brown color represented a positive reaction.    2.10  Statistical analysis  The investigation included repeating all experiments three times, and the data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). One\u2010factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni's test were used to determine statistically significant differences among the groups ( p <\u2009.05) using SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).     3  RESULTS   3.1  Effect of SA on irregular estrous cycles in PCOS rats  The PCOS model was evaluated by analyzing changes in the sexual cycle. As exhibited in the pictures from the normal rats, the proestrus smear was predominantly composed of nuclear epithelial cells, the estrus smear was chiefly made up of cornified cells, the metestrus smear was an equal mix of leukocytes, epithelial cells, and cornified cells, and the diestrus smear was mostly composed of leukocytes (Figure 1a ). All four stages, proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus, appeared to be regular in the normal group (Figure 1b ). The vaginal smear of the PCOS group showed continuous estrus or diestrus stages, indicating a prolonged estrus cycle and confirming the successful modeling of PCOS in rats. However, both SA and Met restored the estrous cycle in PCOS rats when compared to the PCOS rats without treatment.   FIGURE 1   Microscopic characteristics of (a) the estrous cycle in the control rats and (b) dynamic changes in the estrous cycle in the four groups. (c) The changes in vaginal exfoliative cytology in rats were determined by Papanicolaou staining assays (scale bar\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u03bcm). The appearances of rat ovaries and uteri are shown.       3.2  Morphological observations of the ovaries and uterus in SA \u2010treated PCOS rats  The PCOS group exhibited generally pale ovarian and uterine tissues (Figure 1c ). Conversely, the ovaries and uterus in the normal rats exhibited a plentiful blood supply and a deep red color. The PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA and PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met groups experienced a positive change in the pathological lesions.    3.3  Histological structure of the ovaries in SA \u2010treated PCOS rats  Figure 2 shows that the sections from the normal rats displayed normal follicles at different developmental stages and CLs, which indicate ovulation. The arrangement of granulosa and theca cells (TCs) was orderly and complete. In contrast, the PCOS group exhibited cystic expansion, significantly enlarged cystic sinus follicles, thinned GCLs, and dramatically reduced numbers of CLs, which are consistent with the pathological changes in the ovaries of PCOS patients. However, the ovarian structure in PCOS rats receiving SA and Met treatments returned to levels similar to those of the normal rats. The GCLs became thicker and regularly arranged, and there were many CLs and significantly reduced numbers of cystic follicles. Additionally, Table 1 shows that there were significantly fewer primary follicles in the PCOS rats than in the normal rats ( p <\u2009.01). Notably, the primary follicle count in the SA\u2010treated PCOS rats was significantly higher than that in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05). Similarly, Met\u2010treated PCOS rats had a higher count of primary follicles than the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). There were no significant differences in the counts of secondary follicles among all animals. The count of antral follicles (AFCs) was higher in the PCOS rats than in the normal rats ( p <\u2009.01). There was no significant difference in AFC between the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA group and the PCOS group, but the AFC was significantly lower in the Met\u2010treated group than in the other PCOS group ( p <\u2009.05). The numbers of AF and CF were significantly increased in the PCOS group compared to those in the normal group ( p <\u2009.01), and these numbers were significantly decreased in the SA\u2010 and Met\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). The CL count was significantly lower in PCOS rats than in normal rats ( p <\u2009.01), but the CL counts were markedly higher in the SA and Met treatment groups than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01).   FIGURE 2   Histological observations in the ovaries of SA\u2010treated rats (scale bar\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm, high\u2010magnification scale bar\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u03bcm).

Fibrosis generation was significantly lower in both SA\u2010 and Met\u2010treated rats than in PCOS rats. SA treatment showed a better ability to reduce fibrosis than Met treatment in PCOS rats.   FIGURE 3   Masson's staining observations of the ovaries of PCOS rats treated with SA.       3.5   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of the ovaries in SA \u2010treated PCOS rats  When normal rats were examined, the oolemmas surrounding the oocytes were uniform and integrated with the adjacent follicular cells (FCs), and scattered mitochondria with intact cristae were observed in the cytoplasm of the oocytes (Figure 4a ). Oocytes with nuclei and mitochondria in the cytoplasm, along with corpus luteum cells containing lipid droplets, a well\u2010developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), a granular endoplasmic reticulum (GER), and mitochondria were also observed (Figure 4d,f ). Mitochondria and a uniform membrane structure were observed in the GCs (Figure 4b,e ). TCs in the follicles exhibited typical characteristics of steroid\u2010expressing cells and contained lipid droplets (Figure 4c ). All cells, GER, SER, and mitochondria appeared to have normal morphology. The PCOS group exhibited a considerable number of degenerative changes in the follicles. An abundance of apoptotic GCs spilled into the antrum, and a thickened zona pellucida (ZP) and shrunken GCs were present (Figure 4g ). Some follicles showed expanded intercellular spaces between GCs (Figure 4h ). Similarly, there were large spaces between the thickened ZP and inner GCs (Figure 4g ). The GCLs of CF were only 1\u20132 cells in height and were surrounded externally by a thickened theca layer (Figure 4i ). The GCs exhibited enlargement of SER and GER, as well as clumping of heterochromatin in the nucleus. Swollen and degenerated mitochondria were observed in the cytoplasm (Figure 4j,k ). An increase in the intercellular space, degenerated mitochondria with deteriorated cristae structures, and excessive lipid accumulation were found in the theca cell layer (TCL) (Figure 4i,l ).   FIGURE 4   Electron micrographs of ovaries (a\u2013x). Arrow: large spaces, *, microvilli; BI, basal lamina; GC, granulosa cell; GER, granular endoplasmic reticulum cisternae; L, lipid droplets; M, mitochondria; N, nucleus; O, oocyte; SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisternae; TC, theca cell; ZP, zona pellucida. Bar\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u03bcm.     Upon examination of oocytes from the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA and PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met groups, an intact ZP structure and integrity between the surrounding GCs were observed (Figure 4m,n,s,t ). The FCs of the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA and PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met groups contained fewer degenerated mitochondria, lipid droplets, and apoptotic GCs than those in the PCOS group (Figure 4o,u ). Healthy mitochondria with cristae structures were detected in the GCs (Figure 4r,w ). It was also observed that the structures of the nucleus, GER, and SER in these cells had returned to normal morphology (Figure 4r,v ). Regular arrangements of the TCL and a healthy mitochondrial structure were also observed in these cells (Figure 4p,x ). In the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA group, there were some spaces between the thickened ZP and the inner GCs (Figure 4m ).    3.6  Effects of SA on BW and visceral adipose weight in PCOS rats  Figure 5 shows that the BW and visceral adipose weight were significantly higher in PCOS rats than in normal rats ( p <\u2009.01). The BW and visceral adipose weight of both the SA and Met treatment groups were lower than those of the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01 and p <\u2009.05, respectively).

The data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.       3.7  Effects of SA on the serum levels of FBG , AUC of OGTT , fasting insulin ( FINS), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA\u2010IR) in PCOS rats  Both the SA and Met treatments reduced the serum FBG values compared to those of the untreated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05 and p <\u2009.01, respectively) (Figure 6 ). The AUC values for OGTT, FINS, and HOMA\u2010IR were significantly higher for the PCOS rats than for the normal rats ( p <\u2009.01). In contrast, these AUC values were significantly lower in both the SA\u2010 and the Met\u2010treated groups than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01).

The data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.       3.8  Effects of SA on the serum levels of sex hormones in PCOS rats  The serum T levels were higher in the PCOS group than in the normal group ( p <\u2009.05), and the T levels were significantly lower in the PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met group than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.05) (Figure 7 ). A significant reduction in the LH/FSH ratios was observed in the SA and Met treatments in comparison to the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01 and p <\u2009.05, respectively). It was observed that the levels of LH and E2 in SA\u2010 and Met\u2010treated PCOS rats were significantly lower than in untreated PCOS rats, and that the serum levels of E2 and LH in SA\u2010treated PCOS rats were more markedly reduced than in Met\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). The serum FSH levels were lower in the PCOS rats than in the normal rats ( p <\u2009.05), and both SA and Met treatments increased the FSH levels to levels higher than those of the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05 and p <\u2009.01, respectively).

Additionally, the levels of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol/high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL\u2010C) were higher in the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA group than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.05), and the levels of these markers were lower in the PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met group than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01). Furthermore, the levels of TG were lower in the Met\u2010treated PCOS group than in the SA\u2010treated group ( p <\u2009.01). In both the SA\u2010 and Met\u2010treated PCOS groups, the serum levels of HDL\u2010C were higher than those in the nontreated PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01). Interestingly, the levels of LDL\u2010C were significantly lower in the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA and PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met groups than in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.05 and p <\u2009.01, respectively).

The data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.       3.10  Effects of SA on the serum levels of SOD and MDA in PCOS rats  Figure 9 reveals a significant decrease in serum levels of SOD in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). No notable discrepancies in serum levels of SOD were observed among all PCOS groups, which included both the SA and Met treatments. Conversely, the serum levels of MDA were substantially increased in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01). Administration of SA and Met was able to reduce the serum levels of MDA in the PCOS rats compared to the untreated PCOS rats (both p <\u2009.01).

Ovarian mRNA expression of Cat, Sod2, Gpx3, Mgst1, Gsta4, Gsr, Sod1, and Prdx3 was analyzed by quantitative RT\u2013PCR assays. \u03b2\u2010Actin was used as an internal control, and the relative mRNA level of each gene was normalized to the mRNA level in the normal group. * p <\u2009.05, ** p <\u2009.01 vs. the normal group; # p <\u2009.05, ## p <\u2009.01 vs. the PCOS group; \u2666 p <\u2009.05, \u2666\u2666 p <\u2009.01, the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA group vs. the PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met group. The data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.       3.11  Effects of SA on the mRNA levels of antioxidant factors in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats  As shown in Figure 9c , SA administration significantly increased the levels of Prdx3 , Gsta4 , Gpx3 , Gsr , Sod1 , Sod2 , Cat , and Mgst1 compared with those in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). Similarly, Met administration increased the levels of Gsr , Sod1 , Sod2 , Cat , and Mgst1 compared to those in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). The Gsta4 levels in the Met\u2010treated PCOS rats were significantly higher than those in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05). The increase in the mRNA levels of Gsta4 , Sod2 , Cat , and Mgst1 was much more pronounced in Met\u2010treated PCOS rats than in SA\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01).    3.12  Effects of SA on the protein levels of Smads in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats  As shown in Figure 10 , the p\u2010Smad2 and p\u2010Smad3 levels in both the SA and Met treatments were significantly lower than those in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01), and the decrease in the SA\u2010treated PCOS rats was more pronounced than in the Met\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01). Moreover, the Smad4 levels were considerably lower in the SA\u2010treated and Met\u2010treated rats than in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01), with a more pronounced decrease in the SA\u2010treated PCOS rats than in the Met\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05). In PCOS rats, the Smad7 levels were significantly lower than those in normal rats ( p <\u2009.01). In the SA\u2010treated and Met\u2010treated PCOS groups, the levels of Smad7 proteins were notably higher than those in the PCOS group ( p <\u2009.01 and p <\u2009.05, respectively), with a more marked increase observed in the SA\u2010treated PCOS rats than in the Met\u2010treated PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01).

The TGF\u2010\u03b2R1 and \u03b1\u2010SMA levels of the Met\u2010 and SA\u2010treated groups were lower than those of the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.01 and p <\u2009.05, respectively). We also observed that the PPAR\u2010\u03b3 levels were increased in both SA\u2010 and Met\u2010treated PCOS rats than in the PCOS rats ( p <\u2009.05 and p <\u2009.01, respectively).

The data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.       3.14  Effect of SA on the ovaries of PCOS rats as assessed by immunohistochemical staining  The positive staining of TGF\u2010\u03b21 and Smads was markedly decreased and the positive staining of Smad7 expression was significantly increased in SA\u2010 or Met\u2010treated PCOS rats compared with that in PCOS rats (Figure 12 ). The PCOS\u2009+\u2009Met group showed more Smad7 reactivity than the PCOS\u2009+\u2009SA group, with significantly lower levels of TGF\u2010\u03b21, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 detected in the pixel\u2010based intensities.

Our investigation of an in\u00a0vivo rat model was necessary to further elucidate the mechanisms of PCOS and to explore effective treatment methods. Previous reports have suggested that the letrozole\u2010induced PCOS rat model is a frequently used testing animal model that recapitulates human PCOS in many ways (Reddy et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Wang, Yin, & Xu, 2020 ).  Notably, letrozole administration increases the serum levels of sex hormones (T, LH) and disrupts the LH/FSH ratio balance. Moreover, changes in estrogen\u2010dependent organ mass, such as a decrease in uterine mass and an increase in ovarian mass, and an increase in body mass gain have been observed, signifying that the rats are overexpressing androgens (Zych et\u00a0al., 2018 ). It is generally accepted that PCOS is characterized by increased testosterone levels, and research has shown that this increase in T can have an effect on metabolism and eating habits in women, which could lead to metabolic disorder and weight gain (Barber et\u00a0al., 2006 ; Sanchez\u2010Garrido & Tena\u2010Sempere, 2020 ).  Androgens are not the only factor linked to PCOS, as IR has also been associated with the condition. In\u00a0vitro experiments have revealed that the hypothalamus and pituitary gland contain insulin receptors, which can induce the release of FSH and LH when exposed to increased insulin concentrations (Adeyanju et\u00a0al., 2019 ). The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal (HPG) axis is the main regulator of reproductive activities. The hormones of rats with letrozole\u2010induced PCOS exist in a hyperandrogenized state that is responsible for abnormal ovarian physiology (Jahan et\u00a0al., 2016 ). Disruption of the usual HPG axis elevates both T and LH. This change is due to excess T feedback to the pituitary gland, which results in excess LH and decreased FSH levels. We suggest that SA may also regulate ovulation by acting on the HPG axis, since T, LH, and LH/FSH levels were significantly lower in the SA treatment group than in the PCOS group. Our findings demonstrate the advantageous effect of SA on hormonal parameters.  Diabetes mellitus has been known to be connected with the emergence and development of PCOS (Joham et\u00a0al., 2014 ). Initially, PCOS presents as hyperglycemia, which over time progresses to IR (Boudreaux et\u00a0al., 2006 ). Our research revealed that FBG, AUC of OGTT, and HOMA\u2010IR levels, which are indicative of IR, were significantly increased in PCOS rats. This is consistent with prior studies that showed that letrozole\u2010treated PCOS rats developed IR (Wang, Yin, & Xu, 2020 ). Decreases in FBG and the AUC of OGTT were observed in the SA group, indicating the development of normal glucose tolerance. As in previous studies, the SA group may have experienced improved insulin\u2010mediated glucose uptake with a resultant normal glucose tolerance (Cherng et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia associated with IR may increase lipogenesis and ultimately lead to dyslipidemia (Sam & Dunaif, 2003 ). Letrozole treatment induced typical disturbances in lipid metabolism in the PCOS group, which is consistent with the literature (Morrone Mda et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Sivasinprasasn et\u00a0al., 2015 ). Oral administration of SA significantly prevented the increases in the serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL\u2010C. Our observation is in accord with that of SA ameliorated dyslipidemia by increasing the levels of HDL\u2010C and decreasing the serum levels of TG in HFD\u2010fed rats and Syrian hamsters, respectively (Wang et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Yang et\u00a0al., 2019 ). These findings indicate that SA has a positive impact by improving IR and preventing dyslipidemia.  It has been established that the termination of folliculogenesis is the cause of atresia in ovarian follicles (Lerchbaum & Obermayer\u2010Pietsch, 2012 ). We also observed that letrozole induced significant changes in the amounts of AF and CF and decreased the number of CLs in PCOS rats in this study. Hong et\u00a0al. reported a high number of AFs and CFs with a thin layer of GCs in the ovaries, which is consistent with our finding (Hong et\u00a0al., 2019 ). High concentrations of LH in PCOS patients can cause luteinization to occur prematurely, thus stalling the progression of folliculogenesis at the small antral follicle stage (Carvalho et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Administration of letrozole induced an increase in T, which may impair follicle development and increase atresia in PCOS rats (Celik et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Kuyucu et\u00a0al., 2020 ). However, administration of SA was able to reduce the formation of numerous AFs and CFs in PCOS rats. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations suggested the occurrence of structural changes, such as irregularity of the ZP, disjunction of GCs, attenuation of the GCL, and thickening of the TCL in the CF of PCOS rats. Additionally, degenerative changes in mitochondria, an expanded SER and GER, and many lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of interstitial cells were observed in PCOS rats. Studies on the effects of androgens on follicles have revealed that after androgen treatment, ovarian GCs contain a considerable amount of lipid droplets, large antral follicles with a thin GCL, and a disruption of the basement membrane and GCs (Okutsu et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Tessaro et\u00a0al., 2015 ). We observed that SA treatment improved the ultrastructure of the ovaries in PCOS rats. Similarly, resveratrol has been found to ameliorate mitochondrial damage and SER and GER expansion in TCs and to improve the ZP, GCL, and TCL (Furat Rencber et\u00a0al., 2018 ). The reversal in ovarian structural changes may be a direct consequence of improved serum levels of sex hormones (Celik et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Oxidative stress is considered one of the risk factors for PCOS (Khodaeifar et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023 ). It has been reported that PCOS patients have decreasing levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and SOD (Furat Rencber et\u00a0al., 2018 ). The heightened levels of oxidants may modify the environment of the ovaries, leading to augmented androgen production and polycystic ovaries (Sabuncu et\u00a0al., 2001 ). Our research revealed that the levels of MDA were increased and the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes were decreased in the ovaries of PCOS rats (Figure 9c ). The results indicated that SA was capable of decreasing MDA production and augmenting the serum activity of endogenous antioxidants, which showed a capability to shield ovarian tissue from oxidative damage in PCOS rats. Quercetin has been indicated to have an activity that increases the activity of CAT, GSH, SOD, and GPx in PCOS rats (Sarwat Jahan et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  In addition, when oxidative stress occurs, pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF\u2010\u03b21 and nuclear factor\u2010kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB), are secreted at the injured site. In the short term, inflammation is thought to be beneficial, eliminating pathogens. However, chronic inflammation is harmful and is strongly associated with fibrosis (Luedde & Schwabe, 2011 ). When NF\u2010\u03baB signaling is activated in damaged cells, it can activate the expression of genes encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL\u20106), two important pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (Qu et\u00a0al., 2021 ). The positive feedback loop between NF\u2010\u03baB and TNF\u2010\u03b1 appears to increase levels of inflammation and damage in cells. Therefore, downregulating the activity of related cytokines can inhibit fibrosis (Yang et\u00a0al., 2021 ).  The presence of ovarian dysfunction and ovarian fibrosis in PCOS patients makes it challenging for them to conceive. The development of follicles is strongly linked to TGF\u2010\u03b21 (Omwandho et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Young et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Overexpression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 has been observed in PCOS patients (Takahashi et\u00a0al., 2017 ), and the related activation of TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smads also promotes fibrosis (Miao et\u00a0al., 2012 ; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a fibrotic factor that encourages the growth of fibroblasts and promotes the formation of the ECM (Wang et\u00a0al., 2018 ). After SA intervention, the ovarian protein levels of CTGF and TGF\u2010\u03b2R1 were effectively decreased, while the level of Smad7 was increased. Raish et\u00a0al. reported that SA inhibited the activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and could mitigate lung fibrosis in SD rats (Raish et\u00a0al., 2018 ). As an integral member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, evidence suggests that PPAR\u2010\u03b3 is a regulator of glucose levels, cellular differentiation, and inflammation (Giampietro et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Huang et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Soliman et\u00a0al., 2019 ). We noted a considerable rise in ovarian PPAR\u2010\u03b3 expression in rats with PCOS following treatment with SA. It has been reported that an elevated amount of PPAR\u2010\u03b3 may suppress collagen I production that is activated by TGF\u2010\u03b21, implying that these proteins could be integral to organ fibrosis (Zych et\u00a0al., 2019 ). The findings from our experiments indicate that SA has the ability to deactivate the TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smads pathway and enhance the activation of PPAR\u03b3. This suggests that SA might have potential therapeutic benefits in preventing fibrosis in the ovary.    5  CONCLUSIONS  To summarize, the current study indicates that SA has the ability to regulate metabolic disturbances, improve oxidative stress, and reduce ovarian fibrosis in rats with PCOS. This study illustrates how SA intervention can influence the dysfunction of the TGF\u2010\u03b21/Smads pathway in PCOS rats. The data of this study revealed that regarding the majority of the findings, there were no significant differences between SA and Met and that SA was superior in ameliorating the PCOS, which indicates that SA may be an alternative to Met in PCOS treatment. Since patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms due to the use of metformin, the next step of this study is to establish dose\u2010dependent experiments in which SA dose is stabilized. Also, other molecules related to this pathway could be investigated with further and more accurate techniques. Thus, the effectiveness of SA can be evaluated precisely. Further controlled clinical studies are required to determine the effects of SA in the treatment of PCOS.
