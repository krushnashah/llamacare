    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affects 5% to 12% of reproductive-aged\nwomen, 1 , 2 is the leading\ncause of sub-fecundity and anovulatory infertility, with characteristics of\nhyperandrogenism, irregular menstruation, and ovulatory dysfunction. 3 , 4 Women with PCOS who have not\nresponded to first- or second-line ovulation induction therapies or who have\nadditional fertility factors can turn to in vitro fertilization (IVF). 5 However, pregnancy outcomes following IVF are not satisfactory because of\nfailed fertilization 6 and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. 7 Heterogeneous etiology, with genetic, environmental, clinical, and\nbiochemical factors, may be involved in PCOS phenotypes and compromised pregnancy outcomes. 8 Remarkably, PCOS patients are thought to represent a subpopulation sensitive\nto compounds that interfere with the endocrine system. 9 For instance, plasticizers such as bisphenol A (BPA) or phthalates, which are\nendocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are possible environmental contributors to\nPCOS pathogenesis. 10 , 11 Serum BPA may be involved in insulin resistance and\nhyperandrogenism of PCOS. 12 The previously reported association of EDCs with menstrual disturbance, 13 reduced fecundability, 14 and adverse IVF outcomes 15 may have been affected by the inclusion of women with PCOS in these\nstudies.  Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), is one of the most common EDCs and the most widely\nused plasticizer indoors, and it can be found in cosmetics, toys, construction\nmaterials, and cleaning solutions. 16 Concerns have been raised that DEHP is continuously released and exposed in\nthe environment during the use of plastic products. 17 DEHP can be absorbed by food and water from contact materials 18 and is contained in many medical devices. 19 Thus, humans can be exposed to DEHP through oral ingestion, inhalation, and\ndermal exposure. Furthermore, DEHP is able to cross the placenta, as DEHP and its\nmetabolites have been detected in amniotic fluid, which may result in exposure risk\nto the developing fetus. 20 With the potential to cause reproductive and developmental toxicity, DEHP has\nshown adverse effects on sexual maturation, fertility, pregnancy, and the female\nreproductive tract. 21  In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that\nexposure to DEHP impairs folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation in rodents and\ninduces epigenetic changes in germ cells that can be transmitted to subsequent\ngenerations. 22 , 23  A few studies have explored the relationship between PCOS and exposure to EDCs\n(mainly BPA). Considering the high prevalence of PCOS and the potential reproductive\ntoxicity caused by DEHP, we hypothesized that exposure to DEHP may be involved in\nPCOS and might relate to some of the negative effects on reproduction. The aim of\nthe study was to measure DEHP levels in follicular fluid (FF) of women with and\nwithout PCOS and to explore the association of DEHP level with pregnancy outcome in\nwomen with PCOS undergoing IVF. Furthermore, as this study aimed to explore the\nmechanisms underlying the action of DEHP, we also investigated the in\nvitro effects of DEHP exposure on human granulosa cells (GCs) and the\nsteroidogenic human granulosa-like tumor cell line KGN.    Materials and methods   Participants  The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of School of\nMedicine, Zhejiang University (Ethics Committee reference number 20170047), and\ninformed consent was obtained from all study participants. Fifty-six infertile\nwomen with PCOS and 51 infertile women with tubal blockage (who served as\ncontrols) were recruited into this case-control pilot study. Human GCs were\ncollected from an additional 22 infertile women with tubal blockage for the in vitro study. The women with PCOS were diagnosed\naccording to the revised 2003 Rotterdam criteria, indicating PCOS to be present\nif at least two of the following three criteria are met: oligo- or anovulation,\nclinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries\nviewed on an ultrasound. 24 Inclusion criteria were 20 to 45 years of age, a body mass index (BMI)\n\u226435, and undergoing IVF. Women with possible ovarian tumors, congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease were\nexcluded. The control subjects had regular menstrual cycles and normal sex\nhormone levels. No structural abnormalities of the uterus and ovaries were found\nby vaginal ultrasound or laparoscopy in any of the women. All partners of the\nwomen had normal spermiograms and sperm morphology.  All of the women were referred to our department for IVF. They received the long\nagonist protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, with administration of\nrecombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH, Gonal-F; Serono International\nS.A., Geneva, Switzerland) after being downregulated with triptorelin (Serono\nInternational S.A.). The dosages of gonadotropins were individualized according\nto serum estradiol levels and transvaginal ultrasound measurements of the\nfollicles. When at least one of the follicles reached a diameter of 18 mm,\n10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Libao Biochemistry Co., Zhuhai,\nChina) was administered 36 hours before ultrasound-guided follicle\naspiration.    Sample collection  Peripheral blood was collected on day 3 of a natural menstrual cycle or during\nwithdrawal bleeding. The serum was separated by centrifugation at\n3000\u2009\u00d7 g for 10 minutes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until\nmeasurement of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone (TT), and\nestradiol (E2). Follicular fluid and ovarian GCs were collected from women on\nretrieval day. The FF was sampled by a transvaginal ultrasound-guided puncture\nand aspiration of 16- to 18-mm-diameter follicles. Fluid collected from a single\ndominant follicle of the first aspirated follicle of each ovary that did not\ncontain any visible blood contamination was used in this study. The FF samples\nwere centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1300\u2009\u00d7 g to isolate GCs. The\nsupernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C before DEHP concentrations were measured. The\nhuman GCs contained in the pellet were purified using Percoll gradient\ncentrifugation to remove red blood cells and cellular debris. If red blood cells\nwere not clearly removed, red blood cell lysis buffer (Biosharp, Hefei, China)\nwas added at a 4:1 ratio for 3 to 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The collected GCs were used\nfor the in vitro DEHP exposure study.    Measuring DEHP in FF  FF samples used for the detection of DEHP were prepared by adding 200\u2009\u00b5L of\n0.5\u2009mol/L (pH 5.5) sodium acetate solution to 200\u2009\u00b5L of FF sample. After the\nsamples were vortexed for 1 hour at room temperature, 800 \u00b5L of ethyl\nacetate:hexane (60:40, v:v) was added, and the samples were mixed for 2 minutes.\nTo perform liquid-liquid extraction, the samples were centrifuged at\n5000\u2009\u00d7 g for 10 minutes at room temperature; then, the\nupper layer was removed (640 \u00b5L) and added to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube. Next,\n800 \u00b5L of ethyl acetate:hexane (60:40, v:v) was added to the lower layer and\nmixed for 3 minutes, centrifuged at 4000\u2009\u00d7 g for 15 minutes at\nroom temperature and, again, the upper layer was removed (720 \u00b5L). The two\nextraction solutions were combined, and the solution was separated into two\ntubes, 680 \u00b5L/tube, and vacuum dried. Then, an acetonitrile:water solution\n(50:50, v:v) was added, the samples were vortexed, centrifuged at\n15,000\u2009\u00d7 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was\nsubjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.\nEight microliters of sample was injected. A quality control sample was prepared\nin parallel and tested at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the\nexperiment. The LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using an LC-ESI (QSTAR Elite;\nApplied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) mass spectrometer. 25 Data analysis was performed using Analyst QS Software 2.0 (Applied\nBiosystems/MDS Sciex) to extract the peak area of ion pair 228.27.    Cell culture and exposure to DEHP  Primary-cultured human GCs were isolated from the FF of 22 women with tubal\nblockage who were undergoing IVF. The human GCs were cultured in RPMI-1640\nmedium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal\nbovine serum (FBS; Gibco), and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at\n37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . The KGN cells were\nkindly provided by the laboratory of Professor Fan Jin (Women\u2019s Hospital, School\nof Medicine, Zhejiang University). The KGN cells have similar properties to\nhuman GCs, including the expression of functional follicle-stimulating hormone\n(FSH) receptor and relatively high aromatase activity. 26 KGN cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Gibco)\nsupplemented with 10% inactivated FBS and 100\u2009U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin at\n37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere, with 5% CO 2 . Human GCs and KGN cells\nwere seeded respectively at 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 cells per well in six-well plates\nand cultured for 24 hours before DEHP (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis,\nMO) exposure. The medium containing 0 (as control) or 10 nM DEHP was added\nseparately to the cells for 24, 48, or 72 hours.    Measurement of steroid hormone production  After DEHP exposure for 24 hours, the supernatant of human GCs culture medium was\ncollected. The levels of testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, and estrone\nin the supernatant were detected by LC-MS/MS.    Western blotting analysis  Primary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells were lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate\nbuffer after exposure to DEHP for 24 hours. A bicinchoninic acid assay kit\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine the protein\nconcentration. Protein lysates were loaded, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and\nelectro-transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The membrane was blocked for 2 hours at\nroom temperature with 5% skimmed milk in Tris buffered saline-Tween (10 mM Tris,\npH 7.6, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), and then probed with primary\nantibodies against CYP19A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2000), CYP17A1 (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, 1:1500), and an internal control, GAPDH (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, 1:3000). After incubation with their corresponding secondary\nantibody, the signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham\nBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The densitometric intensity was measured\nusing a GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). CYP17A1\ncatalyzes two oxidase reactions and leads to the conversion of pregnenolone and\nprogesterone into C19 steroids, such as androstenedione, whereas CYP19A1 can\ncatalyze either androstenedione or testosterone, yielding estrone or estradiol, respectively. 27    Cell viability assay  For cell viability analysis, 100 \u00b5L of primary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells\nwere seeded in 96-well plates at 7000 cells per well and incubated overnight.\nFor a better observation of cell viability over time, cells were under 0\n(control) and 10 nM of DEHP treatment for 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively, and\nthen cell viability was analyzed using an MTT assay kit (cell proliferation)\n(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, after\nthe cell cultures were exposed to DEHP, 10\u2009\u00b5L of 5\u2009mg/mL MTT solution was added\nto the culture of each well. The cells were subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4\nhours, and absorbance was measured using a microplate reader at a wavelength of\n492 nm (A492). Cell viability rate (%) was calculated by the ratio of A492 in\nthe DEHP exposure group to A492 in the untreated, control group.    Cell cycle assay  For cell cycle analysis, primary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells treated with\nDEHP were plated in 6-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 cells per well and\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. The cells were then collected, washed twice with\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 70% cold ethanol at 4\u00b0C\novernight. Then, 50\u2009\u00b5g/mL propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) with\n100\u2009\u00b5g/mL RNaseA was added to the cells at 4\u00b0C in the dark for 30 minutes. The\ncell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton\nDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).    Apoptosis analysis  To assess whether DEHP had an apoptotic effect, apoptotic cells were determined\nby annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and the rate of apoptosis was\nassessed using flow cytometry analysis. After exposure to DEHP for 48 hours,\nprimary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells were collected and washed with PBS,\nincubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate for 15 minutes and\ncounterstained with PI for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Apoptotic\ncells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson).    Real-time quantitative PCR analysis  Expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, and Bcl-2 mRNA\nin both primary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells were analyzed with real-time\nquantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). After DEHP exposure for 24 hours, total RNA was\nextracted from human GCs and KGN cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) according to a standard protocol. The concentration and\nquality of the RNA samples were evaluated using a NanoDrop ND-100\nspectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription was\nperformed with the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa,\nDalian, China) following standard protocols. Quantitative PCR was performed\nusing the Applied Biosystems 7500 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primers\nspecific for caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bcl-2, and GAPDH genes\nfor humans were provided by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology (Shanghai,\nChina). PCR reactions were performed using 2 \u00b5L of cDNA, 10 \u00b5M each primer, 50\u00d7\nROX reference dye II, and 2\u00d7 SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) in 20-\u00b5L reactions. The\nthermal cycler protocol was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, followed by 40\ncycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 34 seconds. The experiment was\nrepeated three times. The cycle threshold (Ct) value for GAPDH mRNA was subtracted from that of the target gene, and the relative mRNA\nexpression levels of target genes to GAPDH were expressed as\n2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct .    Statistical analysis  Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD), median (quartiles), or n\n(%). A Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was conducted to determine the normal distribution of\nraw or logarithmically transformed data. Differences between the two groups were\nexamined using Student\u2019s t -test for normally or lognormally\ndistributed data or Pearson\u2019s Chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) test for categorical\ndata. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for the non-normally distributed\ndata. Comparisons of multiple groups were conducted with analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s post hoc tests. A two-tailed P -value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nStatistical analyses were carried out with SAS software (version 9.4; SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego,\nCA, USA).     Results   DEHP levels in human follicular fluid  The FF from women with PCOS had significantly higher levels of DEHP (n\u2009=\u200956;\ngeometric mean: 1.68 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval: 1.27\u20132.13) than that of\nwomen in the control group (n\u2009=\u200951; geometric mean: 1.21 ng/mL, 95% confidence\ninterval: 1.06\u20131.38) (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Figure 1 ). The women with PCOS whose FF\nDEHP levels were greater than the geometric mean were defined as the H-DEHP PCOS\ngroup (n\u2009=\u200927); those with levels lower than the geometric mean were included in\nthe N-H-DEHP PCOS group (n\u2009=\u200929).

Clinical characteristics of participants  There were no significant differences among the control, H-DEHP PCOS, and\nN-H-DEHP PCOS women for body mass index, duration of infertility, estradiol\nlevels, dosage of rFSH administered, or induction length. No significant\ndifferences were found between women in the H-DEHP PCOS and N-H-DEHP PCOS groups\nin the abovementioned clinical characteristics. However, women in H-DEHP PCOS\nand N-H-DEHP PCOS groups did differ in LH/FSH ratio, TT levels on day 3 of\nspontaneous menstrual cycle, and the number of oocytes compared with women in\nthe control group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05; Table 1 ).

The ratios of estradiol to testosterone and estrone to androsterone were\nsignificantly lower in the primary-culture medium exposed to DEHP compared with\nthe control (both P\u2009<\u20090.05; Figure 2a) . The mRNA expression level of CYP19A1 in\nhuman GCs following DEHP exposure was significantly lower than in control cells\n(P\u2009<\u20090.05; Figure\n2b) . The protein expression of CYP19A1 was significantly lower in both\nprimary-cultured human GCs and KGN cells after exposure to DEHP compared with\nthe controls (both P\u2009<\u20090.05; Figure 2c) .

Discussion  The current study provided population-based evidence regarding the role of organic\npollutants in female reproductive health; we found increased levels of DEHP in the\nFF of PCOS women, which may be associated with the reduced clinical pregnancy rate\nwhen women with PCOS undergo IVF. This study also demonstrated that in\nvitro DEHP treatment altered steroid production, decreased viability\nand proliferation, and increased apoptosis in primary-cultured human GCs and KGN\ncells.  The profile of PCOS, including alterations in both endocrine and reproductive\naspects, may indicate that women with PCOS represent a sensitive subpopulation for\nEDC exposure. 9 EDCs represent a group of widespread pollutants that may act as possible\nenvironmental contributors to the pathogenesis of PCOS. 10 , 28 Previous studies have shown\nthat DEHP exposure is associated with PCOS characteristics such as altered hormone concentrations, 29 cessation of ovulation, 30 and polycystic ovarian morphology. 29 Prenatal exposure to DEHP that reduces female fertility in a\ntransgenerational manner 31 may contribute to altered fetal programming and be involved in the\npathogenesis of PCOS. 32 Although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated, animal studies have\nshown that DEHP exposure reduces reproductive functions accompanying changes in sex\nhormone concentrations and granulosa cell apoptosis, 33 disrupts primordial folliculogenesis by inducing autophagy in perinatal ovaries, 34 and leads to dysfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis 35 and altered pulsatile LH secretion. 36  According to the traditional two-cell theory of human ovarian steroidogenesis,\nCYP17A1 expression in the ovary is limited to the theca cells, which are the site of\nandrogen production. Granulosa cells do not express CYP17A1 but express CYP19A1 for\nestradiol production; 37 however, studies suggest that human luteinized granulosa cells in culture do\nexpress CYP17A1. 38 \u2013 40 It was\nreported that C-fos, the AP-1 transcription factor, may inhibit the expression of\nCYP17A1 and hence suppress the production of androstenedione. 41 The steroidogenic pathway and the expression of CYP17A1 in the cultured\ngranulosa cells may be affected by several factors, such as the stage of follicular\ndevelopment, the state of the preovulatory granulosa cell in vivo , 42 and the in vitro cell culture system. 39 In this study, the results of the in vitro experiment showed\nthat human GCs had altered steroid hormone production after exposure to DEHP. The\ndecreased ratios of estradiol to testosterone and of estrone to androsterone, as\nwell as the increased androstenedione level after DEHP exposure, indicated reduced\nCYP19A1 activity and enhanced CYP17A1 activity. 43 These findings were further supported by DEHP\u2019s inhibition of CYP19A1\nexpression and upregulation of CYP17A1 expression in both primary human GCs and KGN\ncells. Thus, DEHP affects sex steroid hormone production by altering expression of\nsteroid hormone\u2013associated synthases, which supports the previously reported effects\nof DEHP and its metabolite on steroid production, which resulted from suppressed\ntranscript levels of aromatase in animal and human GCs. 44 , 45  DEHP causes an imbalance in cellular proliferation and apoptosis that is associated\nwith the inhibition of the cell cycle and alteration of apoptosis-associated gene\nexpression, which may drive the development of abnormal reproductive functions of PCOS. 46 The caspase family of proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-7, and\ncaspase-9, which are involved in the caspase cascade responsible for executing cell death, 47 were found to have an upregulated transcript level in KGN cells after DEHP\nexposure, whereas Bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis factor and an important regulator of\nprogrammed cell death, 48 was downregulated in both primary human GCs and KGN cells. Similarly,\nprevious studies reported that DEHP treatment arrested mouse GCs at the\nG 0 /G 1 phase 33 and resulted in the increased cell apoptosis, 33 , 45 and that exposure to DEHP or\nits metabolite induced a decrease in cell viability and promoted apoptosis of rat\nGCs through increasing caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. 49 , 50  To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the concentration of DEHP in\nfollicular fluid of women with PCOS. Follicular fluid serves as a medium for\ncommunication between oocytes and follicular cells, and it provides the\nmicroenvironment for developing oocytes. 51 Thus, increased DEHP levels in follicular fluids of women with PCOS found in\nthis study may reflect changes in the ovarian follicular microenvironment and may be\nassociated with the impaired reproductive functions in PCOS. A strength of the study\nlies in the LC-MS/MS method used to measure the DEHP level in follicular fluids and\nsteroid hormones in cell culture supernatant. With high selectivity and sensitivity,\nLC-MS/MS is becoming established as the instrument of choice for determining\nmetabolites of phthalates in biological samples 52 , 53 and of steroid hormones. 54 Conversely, the study was limited by the small sample size and an\ninsufficient follow-up period. The potential mechanism of DEHP action in the\npathogenesis of PCOS needs further investigation. The effects of DEHP on aromatase\nactivity need to be further explored by adding testosterone or androsterone as\nsubstrate.  In summary, the clinical data in this study support the hypothesis that exposure to\nDEHP is involved in PCOS pathogenesis and in the adverse pregnancy outcomes of women\nwith PCOS who undergo IVF. Our in vitro findings add to our\nunderstanding of how DEHP affects reproductive functions in women with PCOS. To\nfully assess the hazard of DEHP to humans, further studies are needed to confirm the\nrole of DEHP exposure in the pathogenesis of PCOS and explore the underlying\nmechanism. If confirmed, protective strategies and strong recommendations should be\nconsidered to reduce human exposure to protect female reproduction from adverse\nhealth effects. 11    Conclusions  Women with PCOS are exposed to increased levels of DEHP in follicles, which may be\ninvolved in pregnancy loss when undergoing IVF. The mechanisms underlying DEHP\naction may be related to disturbance of steroid production, balance of cellular\nproliferation, and apoptosis in GCs.",
