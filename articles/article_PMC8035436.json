Study quality and body mass index (BMI) were the only covariates that showed a relationship with the outcome in the meta\u2010regression, with a regression coefficient of \u22122.219 (95% CI \u22123.927 to \u22120.511) and \u22121.929 (95% CI \u22123.776 to \u22120.0826), respectively. This meta\u2010analysis indicates that premenopausal PCOS patients are associated with 2.5\u2010fold increase in the risk of NAFLD, and BMI seems to be the main cofactor. We performed a systematic literature review and meta\u2010analysis to investigate the association between NAFLD and PCOS among premenopausal PCOS patients. Of 1833 studies, 23 studies with 7148 participants were included. Women with PCOS had a 2.5\u2010fold increase in the risk of NAFLD compared to controls (Pooled OR 2.49, 95% CI 2.20\u20102.82; I2=55.2%, p=0.001). South American/Middle East populations had a greater risk of NAFLD (OR 3.55, 95% CI 2.27\u20105.55).",
    "body": "Introduction  Non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health problem, affecting almost a quarter of the world's population, and is currently recognized as the most common cause of chronic liver disease globally.  1  ,  2  NAFLD is defined as the detection of >5% fat accumulation within the liver, either by imaging or histology in the absence of other identifiable causes of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption.  3  The disease encompasses a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis to non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma.  4  The estimated global prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 6.3 to 33%, with a median of 20%.  5  However, its risk is considerably higher in some populations such as obese and type 2 diabetics, where the prevalence reaches 69.4%.  6  NASH, the progressive form of NAFLD, is presently the second indication for liver transplantation and is projected to become the leading indication in the coming decade.  7  NASH is already the most frequent indication in women.  8  Parallel to its liver\u2010related outcomes, there is growing body of evidence supporting that NAFLD is a multisystemic disease, and it has strong clinical associations with many extrahepatic conditions.  9  Insulin resistance (IR), which is considered the gameplayer in NAFLD pathogenesis, seems to be the culprit risk factor for most of these associations.  10    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence up to 20%.  11  It is characterized by oligoamenorrhea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasonography.  12  In addition to these main features, metabolically, most PCOS patients have IR with compensatory hyperinsulinemia as an intrinsic feature. Notwithstanding that, obesity, which is frequently associated with PCOS, can also cause IR.  13  Several studies demonstrated that nonobese PCOS patients have higher IR in comparison with non\u2010PCOS women.  14  ,  15  ,  16  The association between PCOS and IR may come with a high prevalence of NAFLD among women with PCOS. NAFLD and PCOS are considered the hepatic and ovarian manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, respectively.  17  ,  18  ,  19  ,  20  ,  21  ,  22  ,  23  However, while some studies reported a higher prevalence of NAFLD in PCOS patients compared to controls, others were inconclusive. One meta\u2010analysis reported a significant association between PCOS and NAFLD, but independent of obesity and geographic region.  24    In this study, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis to estimate the strength of association between NAFLD and premenopausal women with PCOS, as well as identifying cofactors associated with NAFLD.    Methods    Search strategy   This systematic literature review was conducted following a designated protocol and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines  25  ( Appendix S 1 ). The protocol was submitted to the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO),  26  registration # CRD42020154363. The following databases were searched from inception until 1st June 2018 and then updated on 1st February 2020 with inputs from a medical librarian (EM), who ran the former search, and study investigators (MS, TC, GS). The following databases were searched: Africa\u2010Wide Information (Ebsco), Biosis (Ovid & Clarivate Analytics), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), Global Index Medicus (WHO), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) to identify articles that addressed the association between NAFLD and PCOS using the following variations in text words found in the title, abstract or keyword fields, and relevant subject headings: Fatty liver OR hepatic steatosis OR non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease OR NAFLD OR non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis OR NASH OR liver fibrosis OR cirrhosis AND polycystic ovary syndrome OR PCOS. The search was neither limited to defined geographic area nor specific language. See Appendix S 2 for the full search strategy.     Eligibility criteria   Eligible studies were selected according to the following criteria: (i) original observational (cohort, case\u2013control, or cross\u2010sectional) studies; (ii) conducted on premenopausal women \u226518\u2009years old; (iii) a diagnosis of PCOS according to one of the following criteria: Rotterdam criteria, National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, or Androgen excess and PCOS Society (AES) criteria; (iv) NAFLD diagnosis determined by either imaging studies or noninvasive biomarkers; and (v) reported the measure of association (odds ratio [OR]) or provided sufficient data to be calculated.     Data extraction   All retrieved articles in the initial search were read independently by two reviewers (MS and TC), starting with titles and abstracts screening, followed by the full\u2010text reading, and concluded by data extraction.  27  Any disagreements were resolved by mutual discussion or by a third independent reviewer (GS) if necessary. The following data were retrieved from the full text of the selected articles: geographic region, first author, year of publication, country, age, body mass index (BMI), number of participants, enrollment period, PCOS criteria, NAFLD diagnosis modality, prevalence of NAFLD, cofactors of NAFLD, and ORs with confidence intervals (CIs). Data were extracted from each article and sorted into customized tables.     Quality assessment   Evaluation of risk of bias for each paper was performed by two independent reviewers (MS, TC) using the Newcastle\u2010Ottawa Scale (NOS)  28  for nonrandomized studies. The scale judges three broad perspectives: the selection of participants, the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of interest for case\u2013control or cohort studies. As there is no specific scale available for cross\u2010sectional studies from the original source, an adjusted NOS  29  has been adapted. Further modifications have been applied based on the purpose of this review (S1 \u201ccoding manuals\u201d). In this scale, each study will be given an overall quality score; this score is the sum of subscores assigned for each domain that was used to categorize overall study quality.  30  The selection of participant domain subscore was amended (using \u22652 star points instead of \u22653 for fair to good threshold) to account for all study designs. For the interpretation of overall scores, modified dichotomous limits (good vs poor) were applied for simplification purposes. The original description of overall scores were as follows: good (>7), fair (5\u20137), and poor (<5); however, we replaced it with the following thresholds: fair to good (>5) and poor (<5) (Table 1 ).

IR, insulin resistance.        Outcome measures   The primary outcome was to study the association between NAFLD and PCOS among premenopausal women with PCOS. The secondary outcome was to determine cofactors of NAFLD.     Statistical analysis   In the meta\u2010analysis, forest plots were provided to illustrate pooled ORs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs] using a random\u2010effect model.  31  As only seven studies have reported adjusted ORs (aOR), we calculated crude OR for all reviews in order to obtain a standardized measure of association. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the inconsistency ( I  2 ) index. Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding: (i) poor\u2010quality studies, defined as total NOS score <5 and/or subscore thresholds <2 in selection of participants and ascertainment of exposure and outcome and <1 in comparability domain, and (ii) studies that weighed <5%. Publication bias was examined visually via a funnel plot, which is represented as a scatterplot of the degree of association of NAFLD in women with PCOS against sample size.  32  Subgroup analyses were performed by: (i) geographic region, (ii) study design, (iii) NAFLD identification tool, (iv) PCOS diagnostic criteria, (v) presence of IR, (vi) presence of metabolic syndrome, and (vii) BMI. For BMI, eligible studies were stratified into two categories, lean (BMI <25\u2009kg/m 2 ) and overweight/obese (>25\u2009kg/m 2 ). The allocation to either group was based on the following criteria: (i) the study explicitly stated that it investigated NAFLD in either lean or overweight/obese PCOS,  22  ,  33  ,  34  ,  35  (ii) there were data on either (or both) group(s) that allow us to calculate ORs for that subset of patients,  17  ,  23  ,  36  and (iii) studies in which PCOS and controls were matched for body weight and both groups had mean BMI <25 or >25\u2009kg/m 2 were placed accordingly.  18  ,  19  ,  20  ,  37  ,  38  ,  39  ,  40  ,  41  ,  42  ,  43  Using the above\u2010mentioned BMI categories, further subanalyses investigating the presence of IR and the frequency of metabolic syndrome in each BMI subgroup was also conducted. Finally, we evaluated the effect of frequently reported cofactors on the desired outcome (NAFLD) through a meta\u2010regression. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.2 (STATA Corp. LP, College Station, Texas, USA) and funnel plots using R 3.5.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).     Results    Study selection   The PRISMA flowchart is shown in Figure 1 . The search strategy retrieved 1833 records after excluding duplicates. Upon applying our eligibility criteria using Rayyan web application,  27  titles and abstract screening resulted in an elimination of 1781 citations for different reasons; the remaining 52 studies met the criteria for full\u2010text reading. Ultimately, 29 articles published between 2007 and 2019 were found to qualify for the systematic review. Of these, 23 studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis. Six studies were not included in the analysis; five were excluded due to a lack of sufficient data, and one article was excluded because the number of events was zero in both the PCOS and control groups.   Figure 1   Prisma flow chart.        Study characteristics   We divided our inputs from 29 studies into two tables. Table 2a shows articles selected for the systematic review. These were divided according to their geographic areas: 1\u201312 Europe, 13\u201321 Asia, 22\u201325 South America, 26\u201328 the Middle East, and 29 North America. The majority of these articles (25 studies) have used qualitative ultrasonography (alone or combined with additional method) as a diagnostic tool for NAFLD. We also noticed that the Rotterdam criteria were, by far, the predominant standards utilized (23 studies) to identify patients with PCOS. All except four studies were prospective studies. Cofactors of NAFLD determined through multivariate logistic regression analyses were reported only in 12 studies. The three most frequently stated ones were IR measured by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), BMI, and free androgen index (FAI), in descending order. Table 2b depicts the quantitative data such as the number of participants, age, BMI, NAFLD proportion, and ORs with 95% CIs in both arms\u2014PCOS and controls.

Meta\u2010analysis   Across 23 studies that were included in the meta\u2010analysis, with 4164 PCOS cases and 2984 matched controls, pooled OR using the random\u2010effect model was estimated to be 2.49 (95% CI 2.20\u20132.82), an almost 2.5\u2010fold increase in the risk of NAFLD in PCOS compared to controls (Fig. 2 ). The results were significant, with moderate heterogeneity ( I  2 =\u200955.2%, P = 0.001). Publication bias was addressed using the trim\u2010and\u2010fill method developed by Duval and Tweedie.  44  ,  45  The adjusted result from the random\u2010effect model, after accounting for the missing studies (Fig. 3 ), was an OR of 2.56 (95% CI\u2009\u20092.07\u20133.17), which indicates that the result of the present meta\u2010analysis is reliable. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses excluding poor\u2010quality studies and studies that weighed <5% both displayed similar results, with an OR of 2.38 (95% CI, 2.09\u20132.71) and 2.36 (95% CI, 2.05\u20132.70), respectively. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Fig. 4 ). The pooled ORs of most subgroups were not markedly changed by the study characteristics. However, stratification by geographic location revealed that South American/Middle East populations with PCOS had a greater risk of NAFLD than those without PCOS (OR 3.55, 95% CI 2.27\u20135.55) compared to their European (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.85\u20132.67) and Asian (OR 2.63, 95% CI 2.20\u20133.15) counterparts. When we stratified based on IR and the presence of metabolic syndrome, PCOS patients had a significantly higher risk of NAFLD, compared to controls (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44\u20132.71 and OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.42\u20134.76, respectively). Additional stratification by BMI showed a substantial risk of NAFLD in overweight/obese PCOS patients (OR 3.84, 95% CI 3.25\u20134.54) as opposed to weight\u2010matched controls, whereas no risk was noted in lean PCOS (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.077\u20131.25). Although normal BMI was not associated with an increased risk of NAFLD among PCOS patients, IR and metabolic syndrome were more frequent than in non\u2010PCOS individuals (Fig. S1 ). We also noticed that the risk of NAFLD was lower with the NIH/AES criteria (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31\u20132.91) compared to the Rotterdam criteria (OR 2.56, 95% CI 2.25\u20132.91). Significant heterogeneity was observed in subgroup analyses for study design (cross\u2010sectional, I  2 =\u200962.2%, P = <0.001; case\u2013control, I  2 =\u20090%, P = 0.418), PCOS diagnostic criteria (Rotterdam, I  2 =\u200956.8%, P = 0.001; NIH/AES, I  2 =\u200948.4%, P = 0.121), and geographic area (Asia, I  2 =\u200967.4%, P = 0.003; Europe, I  2 =\u200961%, P = 0.009; Middle East & South America, I  2 =\u20090%, P = 0.721). For all groups of NAFLD diagnostic modality (qualitative ultrasonography, I  2 =\u200954.6%, P = 0.002; imaging/noninvasive biomarkers, I  2 =\u200967.5%, P = 0.026), IR ( I  2 =\u200986.2%, P = <0.001), metabolic syndrome ( I  2 =\u200955.4, P = 0.022), BMI <25\u2009kg/m 2 ( I  2 =\u200987.8%, P = <0.001), and BMI >25\u2009kg/m 2 ( I  2 =\u200966%, P = 0.001), heterogeneity reached statistical significance. Nonetheless, the degree of heterogeneity remained unaltered from the main result (Table 3 ). Of note, only three among the included studies looked for the association between PCOS and severity of NAFLD, evaluated via ultrasound. There was no significant difference in NAFLD severity between PCOS patients and controls, possibly because of the relative limited patient populations.  33  ,  43  One of these studies reported the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis in PCOS patients to be 4.7% as determined by transient elastography.  43     Figure 2   Forest plot of studies investigated the association of non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary syndrome.

Meta\u2010regression   General study characteristics such as the presence of matching and aOR, as well as study design and NAFLD diagnostic modalities, revealed no significant association except for study quality, which is defined as (i) fair to good when the total NOS score is >5 given that the subscores for the selection of participants and ascertainment of exposure and outcome domains are \u22652 and for comparability domain is \u22651 and (ii) poor when the total NOS score is <5 given that the subscores for the selection of participants and ascertainment of exposure and outcome domains are <2 and for comparability domain is <1 (regression coefficient\u2009\u2212\u20092.219, CI \u22123.927 to \u22120.511) (Table S1 ). Moreover, among most frequently reported risk factors, only BMI showed an elevated risk with the desired outcome (regression coefficient \u22121.929, 95% CI \u22123.776 to \u22120.082) ( Table S2 ).     Discussion  As NAFLD is becoming the most common cause of chronic liver disease globally, health\u2010care authorities and many well\u2010known liver organizations are currently advocating for NAFLD screening in high\u2010risk groups such as people with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  46  ,  47  ,  48  ,  49  Therefore, identifying populations at risk is the first step toward implementing an effective screening strategy that might help in alleviating the burden of NAFLD\u2010related outcomes, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in researching NAFLD in women with PCOS as the relationship seems extremely relevant in clinical settings: both conditions are common, and their coexistence may synergistically increase the risk of catastrophic consequences of progressive NAFLD, especially in a relatively young PCOS population. Moreover, menstrual and reproductive factors, as well as the use of exogenous hormones, have been associated with the risk of NAFLD in women.  50  Finally, NASH already represents the first indication for liver transplant in women.  8  So far, some studies have found a positive relationship between PCOS and NAFLD when compared to non\u2010PCOS counterparts.  17  ,  18  ,  19  ,  22  ,  23  ,  33  ,  34  ,  36  ,  37  ,  39  ,  40  ,  42  ,  43  ,  51  ,  52  ,  53  ,  54  ,  55  At the same time, others could not determine this association, either because there were no differences between both groups and/or the prevalence in the PCOS group was lower than the general population.  21  ,  35  ,  38  ,  56  To date, data regarding this topic are inconsistent and still evolving.  When we reviewed the literature, we found three previous meta\u2010analyses that investigated the relationship between NAFLD and PCOS. First, a report that included seven studies found that NAFLD was markedly prevalent among PCOS patients presumably due to shared risk factors such as obesity and IR.  57  A subsequent meta\u2010analysis that included 17 studies has confirmed frequent NAFLD occurrence in the PCOS cohort. In addition, the report shed a light on hyperandrogenemia as an additional risk factor contributing to the development of NAFLD in the PCOS population.  58  Finally, another meta\u2010analysis that included 17 studies showed results that were also in total agreement with previous findings. However, the authors were also aiming to identify if these higher figures of NAFLD were related to the presence of PCOS itself or were caused by common risk factors.  24  Indeed, determining the culprit factor(s) contributing to a higher prevalence of NAFLD, especially in PCOS, is a challenging task as this raises the argument of PCOS\u2010defining criteria. AES and NIH definitions mandate the presence of hyperandrogenemia to establish the diagnosis of PCOS. Therefore, PCOS and hyperandrogenemia are relatively synonymous in this context. The only criteria that include a subset of PCOS patients without exhibiting any signs of either clinical or biochemical androgen excess is Rotterdam criteria. Discussing the etiology of NAFLD in PCOS patients is beyond the scope of this study. Although all aforementioned meta\u2010analyses suggested frequent comorbidity of NAFLD in PCOS patients, each of them has its limitation in terms of generalizability. The former meta\u2010analysis has a small sample size,  57  and the other two meta\u2010analyses had quit limited search, they only searched for English language articles from two databases.  24  ,  58  To include a larger, more representative sample and add robustness to the argument that PCOS patients are, in fact, at higher risk of NAFLD, we carried out a systematic literature review searching eight scientific databases and meta\u2010analyses of studies that have reported the prevalence of NAFLD in PCOS patients up to 2020 without any restrictions in the search strategy. Our summary result indicates that PCOS patients are at higher risk of NAFLD (OR 2.49, 95% CI 2.20\u20132.82), a 2.5\u2010fold increase compared to controls. Although this result is in line with previous meta\u2010analyses,  24  ,  57  ,  58  the present study confirms, updates, and adds more strength to the previous findings because it includes more reviews, a total of 29 publication, and thus a larger sample size of 7148 participants compared to 17 studies with 5334 participants in the most recent meta\u2010analysis  24  and 7 studies with 1185 participants in the oldest one,  57  a total increase of 12 and 22 studies, respectively. The characteristics of included studies are variable in terms of study design, PCOS definition, quality appraisal, and results. However, our subgroup and sensitivity analyses suggest that all these factors did not impact the overall results.  Epidemiological studies found different prevalence for NAFLD in the general population across continents. The highest figures were reported from South American and the Middle East, with a prevalence of around 30% for each region.  59  Thus, when we stratified according to geographic locations, we combined these two areas based on the similarity that both ethnicities exhibited. Our results depict that NAFLD risk was also considerably elevated in PCOS patients from these geographic regions. Factors associated with a higher risk of NAFLD reported in most included studies were increased IR,  21  ,  22  ,  34  ,  37  ,  39  worse metabolic profile,  21  ,  37  and hyperandrogenemia.  33  In this meta\u2010analysis, we conducted subgroup analyses for various risk factors aiming to investigate their association with the risk of NAFLD. Apart from geographic area that was previously mentioned, higher BMI and IR were correlated with an increased risk of NAFLD. Likewise, metabolic syndrome was highly prevalent among the PCOS population. Importantly, PCOS patients with normal BMI showed no significant risk for NAFLD compared to weight\u2010matched controls. To our knowledge, this is the first meta\u2010analysis researching IR and metabolic syndrome in a PCOS setting. On top of the aforementioned factors, genetic predisposition seems to be an undisputed contributing factor to the high prevalence of NAFLD in South Americans, where the rs738409 G allele of the patatin\u2010like phospholipase domain\u2010containing protein 3 gene is highly prevalent despite much lower daily caloric intake than in North America and western Europe.  59    Our meta\u2010regression identified an association between study quality and the frequency of NAFLD in women with PCOS. Conversely, other general study characteristics such as matching, study design, adjusted OR, and NAFLD diagnostic tool did not show any significant results. Among most frequently reported risk factors including age, HOMA\u2010IR, and FAI, only BMI indicated an elevated risk for the desired outcome.  This study has several strengths. We broadened our literature search to include eight databases without search strategy restrictions in order to provide a representative sample size that can reflect the PCOS population in general. In addition, studies that have used aminotransferase as a method to diagnose NAFLD were excluded to be consistent with the NAFLD definition. Clinically meaningful factors were investigated in subgroup analysis, adding strength to the existing knowledge. Although our study allows for a clinically meaningful expansion of the literature, it is not without limitations. First, the included studies were all observational, which might be biased due to unmeasured confounders. Second, our summary result was based on crude ORs as only seven reviews reported adjusted ORs. Although some studies were adjusted for main confounders, other modifiable factors were not accounted for in all these studies, such as family history, dietary habits, and/or exercise. The presence of adjusted ORs for all studies and taking into account all possible relevant confounders may have influenced the overall result. Third, ultrasonography was the predominant method for diagnosing NAFLD rather than the gold\u2010standard liver biopsy. This can be justified by the difficulty in applying such an invasive procedure for research purposes. Ultrasonography is a readily available, cheap, noninvasive technique with discrete sensitivity and specificity for epidemiological studies.  In conclusion, our findings indicate that PCOS patients are at higher risk of NAFLD, and BMI seems to be the main driving factor. This risk is increased in women from South America and the Middle East. Therefore, early detection and initiation of intervention plans, including counseling on weight loss and linkage to hepatology care, will be crucial and can reduce or even eliminate the possibility of disease progression as these women can develop NAFLD at a relatively young age. Future research efforts should target the association between PCOS and severity of NAFLD, including liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes.    Supporting information     Appendix  S1 .
