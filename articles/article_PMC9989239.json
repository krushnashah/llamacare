    "body": "What\u2019s Known    Oxidative stress (OS) and metabolic imbalance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may affect kidney function.    What\u2019s New    Hyperandrogenemia causes systemic abnormalities through OS-related mechanisms and damages renal and ovarian tissues. Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment in a rat model is recommended to study the mechanisms that mediate PCOS-associated renal injury.    Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is among the most common endocrine conditions affecting 9-18% of women of reproductive age, depending on the diagnostic criteria used.  1 , 2  PCOS is characterized by at least two of the following criteria, namely clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, oligo-ovulation or anovulation, and polycystic ovary morphology.  3  Clinically, these symptoms are associated with decreased fertility due to follicular maturation dysfunction and subsequent anovulation and hyperandrogenism.  4  In women with PCOS, both chronic anovulation and androgen excess are associated with impaired folliculogenesis characterized by numerous cystic follicles (measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter) and increased ovarian volume.  5    Clinical studies showed that women with PCOS exhibit increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency, leading to excess luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This in turn induces premature acquisition of LH receptor expression resulting in ovarian follicles at very early stages, increased androgen production,  6 , 7  and arrest of antral follicle growth.  8  Ultrasound evaluation in women with PCOS indicated that follicular arrest leads to polycystic ovary morphology.  9  Furthermore, PCOS-affected ovaries exhibit increased preantral and antral follicles development, which results in antrum expansion, increased granulosa cell degeneration, and cystic follicles development with a thin layer of granulosa cells surrounded by a thick theca cell layer.  10  In addition to hormonal and metabolic derangements, oxidative stress (OS) is proactively involved in the etiology of PCOS.  11  OS is defined as an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defenses. In fact, PCOS can be considered a condition due to OS, where the body\u2019s antioxidant defense is unable to offset the generation of excessive free radicals.  12 , 13    Several studies evaluated women with PCOS in terms of coronary health condition and hypertension.  14 - 16  Using a model of chronic hyperandrogenemia in female Sprague Dawley rats, a previous study reported that the animals exhibited high blood pressure, moderate proteinuria, and elevated glomerular filtration rate (GFR); most likely due to hyperglycemia related to insulin resistance.  16  Another study reported that chronic hyperandrogenemia leads to moderate hypertension and a 20% reduction in GFR with proteinuria.  17  Ratliff and colleagues found that the common link between all types of acute and chronic kidney injuries, irrespective of species, is enhanced generation of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) during injury/disease progression.  18  To date, the availability of literature on PCOS-associated renal complications is scarce, while it is well documented that OS-related mechanisms are common in the pathophysiology of kidney disease and PCOS. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of hyperandrogenemia on renal injury and dysfunction through OS-related mechanisms.    Materials and Methods  This study was conducted from December 2019 to September 2021 at Shiraz Nephro-Urology Research Centre, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran).\nThe study protocols complied with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Research Council  19  and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (IR.SUMS.REC.1398.173).   Animal Model  Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were purchased from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Animal Centre. All rats were housed in a cage and kept at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C with a 12h:12h light/dark cycle. The rats were fed with conventional feed pellets and given free access to food and water. In line with the sample size calculation in a previous study,  20  a sample size of 10 was used. The rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=10), namely the control, sham, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) groups. The control group was subcutaneously injected with normal saline for 28 consecutive days, the sham group with 0.2 mL sesame oil (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 28 days, and the DHEA group with 6 mg DHEA, dissolved in 0.2 mL sesame oil, per 100 g/day (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 28 days to induce hyperandrogenism.  21  At the end of the experiment, the rats were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (Alfasan Nederland B.V., The Netherlands) at 50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein of the animals, centrifuged to separate the plasma, and stored at -20 \u00b0C. These were then used to assess the total testosterone levels, oxidative status, and renal function indices. The rats were subsequently sacrificed, and the ovaries and kidneys were immediately removed. The left kidneys and ovaries were kept at -80 \u00b0C to assess the total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The right kidneys and ovaries were kept in 10% formalin for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and pathological evaluation.    Plasma Total Testosterone (PTT) Assay  The PTT assay was carried out using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (DiaMetra, Italy) with a sensitivity of 0.07 ng/mL, according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and the Epoch 2 TM microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, USA).    Renal Function Study  Plasma creatinine (Cr) levels were measured based on the Jaffe and enzymatic colorimetric methods using commercially available kits (Pars Azmun, Iran)\nand the Epoch 2 TM microplate reader at 500 nm wavelength. The assessment of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels was performed based on the urease\nmethod with glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) enzyme using commercially available kits (Pars Azmun) and the Epoch 2 TM microplate reader at 340 nm wavelength.    Measurement of Oxidative Status Indicators  Total protein content in ovary and kidney tissue lysates was determined using the Pierce TM bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\nTOS and TAC values in ovary and kidney tissues were reported per mg of the total protein levels.  Total Oxidant Status Assay: Plasma and tissue (ovary and kidney) values of oxidants were measured using a commercially available kit (KiaZist, Iran)\nand the Epoch 2 TM microplate reader at 560 nm wavelength. Briefly, oxidants present in the sample oxidize the ferrous ion-o-dianisidine complex to a ferric ion.\nThe oxidation reaction is enhanced by glycerol molecules, which are abundantly present in the reaction medium.\nIn an acidic medium, the ferric ion forms a colored complex with xylenol orange. The color intensity, which can be measured spectrophotometrically (560 nm),\nis related to the total amount of oxidant molecules present in the sample. The assay is calibrated with hydrogen peroxide, and the results are\nexpressed as a nanomolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide equivalent per liter (nmol H 2 O 2 Equiv./mL).  Total Antioxidant Capacity Assay: The capacity of antioxidants in plasma, ovary, and kidney tissues was measured using a commercially available kit (KiaZist, Iran)\nand the Epoch 2 TM microplate reader at 490 nm wavelength. This assay, also known as the CUPRAC assay, is based on reducing Cu 2+ to Cu 1+ by\nthe action of antioxidants present in the sample. The oxidant complex, consisting of Cu 2+ -bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (Cu 2+ -BCS),\nreacts with the antioxidants of the sample and is reduced to a Cu 1+ -bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (Cu 1+ -BCS), a stable complex which has a maximum absorbance at 490 nm.\nThe antioxidant capacity of the sample is assumed to be equal to the extent of the complex Cu 1+ -BCS formation. The results obtained from\ntest samples were compared with a standard curve obtained with Trolox and expressed as nanomoles of Trolox equivalents per milliliter.  Oxidative Stress Index (OSI): The ratio of TOS to TAC yields the OSI, an indicator of the degree of OS. The OSI value was calculated according to the following formula:  OSI (arbitrary unit)=TOS (nmol H 2 O 2 equiv./mL)/TAC (nmol Trolox equiv./mL)\u00d7100    Histopathological Analysis  Formalin-fixed hemisected kidneys and ovaries were embedded in paraffin and 5 \u00b5m thick serial sections were prepared and stained with H&E. For each renal slide, 10 randomly selected non-overlapping fields were assessed using a light microscope, and the degree of glomerular and tubular morphological changes was evaluated. The ovary tissue sections were observed under an optical microscope and different follicular groups were evaluated. To evaluate changes in ovarian tissue, ovarian structures were categorized into five groups based on morphology: primary follicles (PF), secondary follicles (SF), tertiary (Graafian) follicles (TF), cystic follicles (CF), and corpora lutea (CL), and their changes in the ovaries were examined. The number of follicles and CL per ovary section was counted for morphometric assessment. The average of different follicle numbers was calculated in 10 parts of ovarian parenchyma in each section (equivalent to 10 fields of 10\u00d7 objective lens of the light microscope) and 20 fields in each group. The mean thickness of TF, theca, and granulosa cell layers was measured in 10 follicles in each section and 20 follicles in each group using ImageJ software, version 1.53q. (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Follicles were classified as PF when one or more granulosa cell layers around a primary oocyte were present, as SF based on the presence of antrum, and as TF when antrum development was completed and characterized by an oocyte surrounded by a cumulus oophorus. Those follicles containing four or five layers of granulosa cells surrounding a very large antrum or a large fluid-filled follicle with an attenuated granulosa cell layer, and thickened theca layer were classified as CF.    Statistical Analysis  Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, version 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA) and expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. Comparison between the groups was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc tests. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results  Plasma total testosterone levels: PTT levels were measured to confirm hyperandrogenism in female rats. The results showed an approximately nine-fold increase in plasma total testosterone levels in hyperandrogenemic female rats (DHEA group) compared to untreated female rats (P=0.0001) ( figure 1 ).   Figure 1   The figure shows the effect of 28 days of DHEA administration on the level of plasma total testosterone in the control, sham (received 0.2 mL sesame oil subcutaneously per day as a vehicle), and DHEA (subcutaneously injected with 6 mg DHEA per 100 g/day) groups (n=10). The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test and expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. **** and #### P<0.0001 represents significant differences between the control and sham groups, respectively. DHEA: Dehydroepiandrosterone.     Effects of Hyperandrogenemia on Renal Function Parameters: Administration of DHEA (6 mg/100 g day, 1\u00d7subcutaneous injection) for 28 days caused a significant increase in plasma Cr (1.164\u00b10.038 vs. 0.594\u00b10.031 mg/dL) and BUN (17.50\u00b11.341 vs. 9.398\u00b10.830 mg/dL)\nlevels in the DHEA group compared to the control group (P=0.0008) ( figures 2A and 2B ).

DHEA: Dehydroepiandrosterone.     Effects of Hyperandrogenemia on Plasma and Tissue TOS Levels: To demonstrate the potential role of the OS signaling pathway in hyperandrogenemia-associated kidney injury, plasma and tissue (kidney and ovary) TOS levels were measured at the end of the experiment.\nThe results showed that rats in the DHEA group had higher levels of TOS in the plasma and tissue samples than the control and sham groups (P=0.003) ( table 1 ).

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used to compare the groups.     Effects of Hyperandrogenemia on the Plasma and Tissue TAC Levels: To confirm the involvement of antioxidant pathways and their possible protective mechanism in hyperandrogenemia-associated kidney injury, the plasma\nand tissue TAC levels were evaluated. As shown in table 1 , the plasma and tissue (kidney and ovary)\nTAC levels in the DHEA group were significantly lower than in the control group (P=0.007). However, compared to the sham group, the decrease was only\nstatistically significant for plasma TAC levels (P=0.002).  Effects of Hyperandrogenemia on Plasma and Tissue OSI:  Table 1 shows the distribution of plasma and tissue (kidney and ovary) OSI values in all groups.\nThe results showed that similar to TOS levels, OSI values in the DHEA group were significantly higher than in other groups.   Histopathological Evaluation of Ovary and Kidney  Effects of DHEA on Ovarian Histomorphology: Pathological assessment and light microscope photography of ovarian morphology are shown in figure 3 .\nBy analyzing the histological morphology of ovaries in the control and sham groups, different follicles were observed, including TF with a thick layer\nof granulosa cells and CL ( figure 3A-D ). A number of CF with a very thin layer of granulosa, which is a characteristic of CF, were observed in the ovaries of the DHEA group.\nOnly a few CL indicative of ovulation was observed in this group ( figures 3E and 3F ).\nTherefore, based on the observation of ovarian tissue, DHEA administration to female rats for 28 days resulted in the development of CF, decreased the number of TF and CL, and significantly reduced ovulation due to the reduction in the number of CL.

Effects of DHEA on Ovarian Histomorphometry: Histomorphometric analysis showed that, compared to the control group, the DHEA group had an increase in the number of CF (P=0.0001)\nand a decrease in the number of CL (P=0.029) ( table 2 ). DHEA administration, to induce PCOS in the female rat model, reduced the number of TF and increased the\nnumber of CF compared to the control and sham groups ( table 2 ).\nIn terms of the diameter of follicles in the ovaries, significant differences were observed between the groups. A significant difference (P=0.0001)\nin the size of the TF due to cysts was observed between the control and DHEA groups ( figure 4A ).\nTheca layer measurements showed a significant increase (P=0.023) in the thickness in the DHEA group compared to the control and sham groups ( figure 4B ).\nIn terms of the granulosa layer thickness, a significant decrease (P=0.036) was observed in the DHEA group compared to the control and sham groups ( figure 4C ).

Discussion  In the current study, we sought to determine potential adverse renal effects in a hyperandrogenemic female rat model and characterized the renal consequences of increased androgens. The results showed an approximately nine-fold increase in total testosterone, a level consistent with androgen levels in women with PCOS,  22  that caused significant renal damage. To identify possible mechanisms through which androgens may cause renal damage, we found that DHEA-treated female rats exhibited characteristics of oxidative imbalance.  Researchers tend to use animal models of PCOS instead of human experimentation because of the ethical and logistic restrictions involved. Widely used hormones in PCOS animal models include DHEA, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol valerate, and letrozole.  23  According to a previous study, the symptoms in DHEA-induced PCOS rat models are very similar to many PCOS symptoms in humans.  24  This animal model is shown to be representative of the early onset of PCOS in young adults.  25  A previous study in young females treated with DHT reported that their GFR increased slightly compared to the placebo controls, and renal morphology showed no glomerular or tubular damage.  16  Another study on postmenopausal hyperandrogenemic female rats reported an increase in proteinuria and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) excretion. This suggested that the rats had significant impairment of renal function and significantly lower GFR than aging controls.  17  Elevation of serum BUN and Cr levels is a sign of deterioration of glomerular function, which causes kidney failure over time.  26 , 27  Our results showed that the administration of DHEA significantly increased plasma Cr and BUN levels, indicative of renal injury. Furthermore, proximal tubular and glomerular injuries were evident in renal tissues.  A study by Yanes and colleagues reported an increase in enzymes that control OS in the kidneys of young female rats treated with DHT.  16  Several other studies suggested that OS may play an important role in infertility and heterogeneous disorders in PCOS patients.  12 , 13 , 28 , 29  On the other hand, PCOS is closely associated with the progression of metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, which are the major causes of kidney disease.  30 , 31  In this regard, Patel and colleagues reported that microalbuminuria in young women with PCOS was associated with metabolic syndrome and hypertension.  32  Solutes reabsorption is the kidney\u2019s most energy-demanding process, therefore, renal tubular cells are rich in mitochondria. This, in turn, makes kidney cells prone to OS and damage.  33    In the present study, we also investigated the association between PCOS and kidney injury through the OS signaling pathway. Kidney function was evaluated by measuring BUN and Cr levels in rats treated with DHEA compared to controls. We also assessed TOS, TAC, and OSI in plasma, ovary, and kidney. The results confirmed renal injury through OS-related mechanisms. Other studies investigated the role of testosterone in PCOS-associated kidney injury. The results of a previous study showed a significant positive correlation between serum testosterone and tubular proteinuria markers in PCOS patients.  34  This further demonstrates that testosterone plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS-associated kidney injury, especially tubular cell injury. In this regard, hyperandrogenemia seems to contribute to OS in PCOS, but the underlying mechanisms of this association remain unclear. It is revealed that OS markers are positively correlated with androgen levels in PCOS patients.  35  Compared with controls, PCOS models induced by excess androgen exposure increased OS markers, such as malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase.  36  Therefore, in our study, a high level of OS (probably induced by hyperandrogenemia in the ovarian tissue) could be related to significant ovarian histopathological changes. Duic\u0103 and colleagues reported increased OS coupled with poor antioxidant status in women with PCOS.  28  Our results also revealed increased OS levels in female rats with DHEA-induced PCOS.  The results of the morphometric analysis showed that the number of TF and CL was reduced in the DHEA group. Moreover, antral follicles developed a cystic structure, their granulosa cells layer became thinner, and their theca cells layer thickened. Other studies using a PCOS rat model stated that these morphological changes result in impaired follicle development, irregular ovulation, and relatively increased atresia.  37 , 38  Therefore, hyperandrogenism can induce OS resulting in follicles atresia and ovary apoptosis.  39  In line with a previous study, our results showed that it also accelerates early follicular growth leading to excess preantral follicles.  40  Overall, our findings indicate that the OS signaling pathway is involved in the adverse effects of androgens on ovarian tissue.  The main limitation of our study was the omission of measuring renal function indices, such as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and KIM-1. It is recommended to include these in future studies. Another limitation was related to matching the reproductive cycle and ovarian age of rats in the animal model to those of women of childbearing age with PCOS. However, this does not undermine the advantages of the DHEA-induced rat model of PCOS in preclinical studies.  24      Conclusion  Renal consequences of increased androgens in a hyperandrogenemic female rat model, which mimics many of the changes seen in women with PCOS, were characterized. The DHEA-treated female rats exhibited an increase in serum Cr and BUN levels as well as OS-associated factors such as increased TOS, decreased TAC, and subsequently higher OSI in the plasma, ovary, and kidney. Through OS-related mechanisms, hyperandrogenemia causes systemic abnormalities resulting in damage to kidney and ovary tissues. We trust that this female rat model will help explain potential mechanisms by which androgens cause kidney disease in women with PCOS.
