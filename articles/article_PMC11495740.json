    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy associated with subfertility in women of reproductive age. Its incidence varies between 6% and 10%, depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria used. [ 1 , 2 ] In the consensus of 3 different societies, PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion. In order to diagnose PCOS, Cushing syndrome, thyroid diseases, idiopathic causes of hirsutism, and causes of hyperprolactinemia must be ruled out. [ 3 , 4 ] The presence of at least 2 of the criteria of oligo-anovulation, hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of PCOS. [ 5 ] The presence of insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and high anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone are not used as diagnostic criteria. [ 6 , 7 ] However, in the presence of these parameters, the clinical picture is more severe in terms of both subfertility management and the frequency and severity of metabolic disorders. [ 8 , 9 ]  Many researchers attribute PCOS-induced subfertility mainly to ovulatory dysfunction (OD). However, although oligo-anovulation is the most important cause of subfertility in most of the cases, it is not the only reason. [ 5 , 6 ] The fact that fertility outcomes in patients with ovulatory PCOS are worse than in healthy controls suggests that the PCOS endometrium is dysfunctional in terms of receptivity. Hyperandorgenemia, IR, and obesity have come to the fore as factors contributing to subfertility. However, increased abortion rates and obstetric complications in PCOS are important evidence that the endometrium contributes significantly to subfertility. [ 10 , 11 ] The biggest and most important difference seen in the endometrium of patients with PCOS occurs due to progesterone deficiency or resistance. Since most patients with PCOS have oligo-anovulation, progesterone synthesis cannot be performed adequately, and estrogen dominance occurs in the endometrium. Peripheral conversion of androgens also contributes to the increase in estrogen. Increased androgens due to hyperinsulinemia may also affect the endometrium together with estrogens, leading to narrowing or premature closure of the implantation window. [ 10 , 11 ] In addition, while progesterone receptor expression decreases, estrogen receptor \u03b1 and androgen receptor expression increase. [ 12 ] All these changes lead to progesterone resistance by preventing the physiological response of the endometrium to progesterone. [ 10 ]  The endometrium of patients with PCOS cannot express receptivity modulators properly due to increased androgens. Homeobox genes and leukemia inhibitory factors are the leading receptivity molecules whose endometrial expression is impaired in PCOS. Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) is a multimeric protein divided into 2 classes, short and long, and is one of the molecules whose expression increases during blastocyst implantation. [ 13 ] Because PTX-3 contributes to both cumulus expansion and decidualization due to its inflammatory properties, [ 14 ] PTX-3 null female mice are infertile due to fertilization failure or implantation defects. [ 15 , 16 ] PTX-3, which is secreted locally and systemically in response to inflammation, plays a role in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. [ 14 ] PTX-3 expression in human endometrium is regulated by trophoblast-derived IL-1\u03b2, progesterone, and estrogens. PTX3 expression is increased in diseases with implantation defects such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. [ 17 ] There are isolated studies reporting decreased or increased PTX-3 in patients with PCOS. [ 18 , 19 ] Some researchers have associated PTX-3 expression with obesity or hyperandrogenemia. [ 20 , 21 ] Some studies have reported that PTX-3 expression changes are associated with IR and endothelial dysfunction. [ 22 ]  The most logical way to analyze the underlying causes of the differences in PTX-3 expression in PCOS across studies is to phenotype patients. Thanks to phenotyping according to NIH criteria, we can analyze how metabolic and endocrine pathologies alter serum PTX-3 in addition to hyperandrogenemia, OD, and PCOM. However, there are no data on systemic PTX3 levels in patients with PCOS stratified by phenotype. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate how circulating PTX3 levels in PCOS women are affected by the disease phenotype.    2. Materials and Methods  A total of 50 Turkish participants, 35 of whom were diagnosed with PCOS according to the revised Rotterdam criteria and 15 fertile controls without clinical and laboratory findings of PCOS, were included in the study. The sample size was taken as Cohen d effect size of 0.80, \u03b1 value of 0.05, and power (1-\u03b2) value of 0.80, and the minimum sample number required for 2-way statistical comparison of 2 independent groups was calculated using G*Power, version 3.1.9.7 (Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). Participants were selected from among patients who applied to the Malatya G\u00f6zde Hospital Gynecology outpatient clinic. Patients who applied to our outpatient clinic before August 15, 2023, and were diagnosed with PCOS were retrospectively screened. In addition to a reevaluation of the demographic and laboratory parameters of patients who accepted the invitation to participate in the study, they were also separated according to phenotypes. No matching was provided for the control group selection except that the participants were overweight. Care was taken to match this because obesity increases PTX-3 levels.  Carrying at least 2 of the 3 parameters below was considered essential for the diagnosis of PCOS: clinical or laboratory HA, OD characterized by oligo-anovulation or amenorrhea, and PCOM with \u226512 follicles 2 to 9\u2009mm in diameter on sonographic evaluation. An ovarian volume of \u226510\u2009mm 3 may or may not accompany this criterion. Laboratory hyperandrogenemia is considered to be the presence of elevated testosterone, decreased sex hormone binding globulin, high free testosterone index, or high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. We considered the presence of high serum testosterone as HA. The presence or absence of hirsutism was also recorded.  Patients in the PCOS group were divided into 4 different phenotypes according to the NIH criteria. HA, OD, and PCOM criteria were taken into account in phenotyping. Patients meeting all 3 HA/OD/PCOM criteria were considered as phenotype A. Phenotype B met only HA and OD conditions. Phenotype C, on the other hand, met the criteria for HA and PCOM. Phenotype D was the group consisting of OD and PCOM. Only phenotype D did not have HA criteria. The other 3 groups (phenotypes A, B, and C) contained HA as a common parameter. Inclusion criteria are given as follows: being diagnosed with PCOS, being between the ages of 20 to 35 years, not having any endocrine or metabolic disease other than PCOS, being infertile, having a low body mass index (BMI) or being overweight/obese, and not having undergone ovarian drilling surgery. Exclusion criteria are given as follows: being diagnosed with HA or OD other than PCOS, Cushing syndrome, thyroid disorders, type 2 diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hirsutism, and hyperprolactinemia. Those who used insulin sensitizer or other hormonal drugs in the last 3 months were also excluded from the study. Since childbirth does not improve the metabolic effects of PCOS, fertile patients with PCOS were not included in the study. The fact that the participants in the control group were fertile and the participants in the PCOS group were infertile may be a potential bias in patient selection. The fact that the groups were not matched in terms of BMI is another bias. The retrospective determination of patients selected for the PCOS group can also be considered as another potential bias.  For the evaluation of basal hormone and biochemical parameters, blood was drawn from the patients in the ovulatory PCOS group on the third day of the spontaneous menstrual cycle. Since most of the cases were anovulatory, basal measurements were made by taking blood samples on the third day of progesterone withdrawal bleeding in these patients. From the patients in the control group, blood was drawn on the third day of their spontaneous menstrual cycle for baseline evaluation. Serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, glucose, and insulin levels were measured. Fasting blood glucose levels were analyzed in blood samples taken after 8 to 10 hours overnight fast. The homeostatic model evaluation formula was used to calculate IR. BMI was obtained by dividing weight in kilograms by height in centimeters (square). PTX-3 measurement was also made in the blood samples taken.   2.1. Serum PTX-3 analysis with ELISA  Serum PTX-3 levels were studied by the ELISA method using the Human PTX ELISA Kit in accordance with the kit procedures. The measuring range of the PTX-3 kit was 0.08 to 20\u2009ng/mL, and the minimum measurable level (sensitivity) was 0.051\u2009ng/mL. The Intra-Assay: CV value of the PTX-3 kit was <10%, while the Inter-Assay: CV value was <12%. Absorbances were read spectrophotometrically at 450\u2009nm.    2.2. Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 27.0 (SPSS, Inc, USA) program and using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the data. Normally distributed data are shown as mean\u2005\u00b1\u2005standard deviation, and nonnormally distributed data are shown as median (first quartile to third quartile). The student t test was used to compare normally distributed data between 2 groups, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonnormally distributed data. The 1-way ANOVA test was used in intergroup comparisons of PTX-3, and the Tamhane T2 test was used to determine the group causing the difference because the variances of the groups were not homogeneous. P <\u2005.05 was considered statistically significant.    2.3. Ethics approval  Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Sciences University Gazi Ya\u015fargil Training and Research Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee with the decision of the board dated August 4, 2023, and numbered 2023/520. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Principles.     3. Results  Demographic and laboratory data of both groups are detailed in Table 1 . The median age of the patients in the PCOS group was significantly lower than the fertile controls ( P <\u2005.001). Although the BMI values of both groups were compatible with overweight, the BMI values of the fertile group were significantly higher than those of the PCOS group (26.9\u2005\u00b1\u20051.39 vs 25.4\u2005\u00b1\u20052.17\u2009kg/m 2 ; P =\u2005.020). The serum luteinizing hormone value of the PCOS group was found to be significantly higher than the control group (8.4 [7.4\u201310.3] vs 5.3 [5.1\u20136.6] IU/L; P <\u2005.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels ( P =\u2005.074). Serum testosterone levels were significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared to fertile patients in the control group (48.6\u2005\u00b1\u20057.89 vs 29.2\u2005\u00b1\u20058.58\u2009ng/dL; P <\u2005.001). HOMA index values were found to be significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared to fertile patients (3.11\u2005\u00b1\u20051.05 vs 1.97\u2005\u00b1\u20050.34; P <\u2005.001). Serum insulin and glucose levels in the PCOS group were significantly higher than in the control group.   Table 1   Comparison of demographic and laboratory data of PCOS and control groups.

Serum PTX-3 levels were first calculated by collecting all patients with PCOS in a single pool regardless of their phenotype. Then, patients with PCOS were divided into 4 different phenotypes, and PTX-3 values of each phenotype were calculated separately. The number of patients in phenotype A was the highest 13 (37.1%). The number of patients in phenotypes B 9 (25.7%) and C 8 (22.8%) was found to be similar. The lowest number of participants was 5 (14.2%). It was also phenotype D. The patient distributions were similar to the classical phenotypic distribution of PCOS.  In the calculations made without phenotyping, the serum PTX-3 levels of the PCOS group were found to be significantly lower compared to the fertile control group (3.32\u2005\u00b1\u20050.73 vs 4.97\u2005\u00b1\u20051.29\u2009ng/mL; P <\u2005.001). In the measurements made by dividing into phenotypes, the serum PTX-3 value was found to be the lowest in the phenotype A group (2.91\u2005\u00b1\u20050.73\u2009ng/mL). The second lowest PTX-3 level was detected in phenotype B (3.04\u2005\u00b1\u20050.35\u2009ng/mL). Serum PTX-3 levels of phenotypes C (3.89\u2005\u00b1\u20050.66\u2009ng/mL) and D (3.95\u2005\u00b1\u20050.33\u2009ng/mL) were found to be similar. When the groups were compared within themselves, serum PTX3 levels of phenotypes A and B were similar. The PTX-3 value of phenotype A was significantly lower than phenotype D ( P =\u2005.008). Similarly, the PTX-3 level of phenotype B was significantly lower than phenotype D ( P =\u2005.009). There was no significant difference between PTX-3 values of phenotypes C and D. When the phenotypes were compared with the fertile control group (4.97\u2005\u00b1\u20051.29\u2009ng/mL), the PTX-3 levels of phenotypes A and B were significantly lower than the fertile group. Although the PTX-3 levels of phenotypes C and D were lower than the fertile group, the difference did not reach statistical significance (Table 2 ).

Discussion  After it was understood that subfertility in PCOS was not only due to OD, attention was turned to the endometrium. The fact that abortion and obstetric complication rates are higher than in the general population, especially in ovulatory PCOS cases, has been an important clue to the presence of endometrial defects. [ 10 , 11 ] Subsequent studies have shown that homeobox A10 and leukemia inhibitory factor, which are the main receptivity modulators, are defectively expressed in the endometrium of patients with PCOS. [ 18 ] PTX-3 is one of the markers used to evaluate receptivity defect and endothelial dysfunction in patients with PCOS.  The results of studies investigating circulating PTX-3 changes in patients with PCOS are heterogeneous. Some studies reported increased serum/plasma PTX-3 levels in PCOS, [ 18 ] while others reported that PTX-3 was decreased especially in patients with obesity with PCOS. [ 19 ] The main reason for the difference between studies may be due to the fact that patients with PCOS were collected in a pool without separating them according to phenotypes and giving a general result. In addition, not grouping patients according to BMI value may lead to heterogeneous results. To avoid this heterogeneity in PTX-3 results, we divided PCOS participants into 4 different phenotypes according to the 2012 NIH consensus panel. Our study is the first clinical study to measure serum PTX-3 levels according to PCOS phenotypes. Thus, we had the opportunity to test whether serum PTX-3 levels were affected by phenotypic variables. The PTX-3 values of the PCOS group, which were measured without phenotype discrimination, were found to be significantly lower than the fertile patients. In the calculations after phenotyping, PTX-3 level was significantly lower in type A and B phenotypes compared to phenotype D. Similarly, PTX-3 levels in A and B phenotypes were also significantly lower than fertile controls. We could not detect a significant difference between C and D phenotypes and fertile controls. In light of these findings, we can suggest that different molecular pathways are functional in the endometrium and other cells that secrete PTX-3 in phenotypes A and B according to phenotype D.  PTX-3 is actually a cytokine-inducible molecule and can be released from many different tissues. It takes part in cumulus expansion, fertilization, and implantation. Since PTX-3 is an acute-phase protein, we expect its levels to increase in PCOS. [ 12 ] However, the PTX-3 difference in PCOS phenotypes may differ according to the distribution of HA, OD, and PCOM that make up the phenotypes. Phenotype A consists of HA/OD/PCOM parameters, and phenotype B consists of HA/OD parameters. The common criteria in these 2 phenotypes are OD and hyperandrogenemia. One of the possible causes of decreased PTX-3 levels in phenotypes A and B may be HA. Pan et al [ 18 ] reported that increased plasma PTX-3 levels in PCOS were associated with HA. The other common parameter is OD. There is no study that correlates OD with circulating PTX-3 levels. However, since PTX-3 plays a role in cumulus cell expansion and promotes follicular development, an expression defect may occur in the case of OD. [ 12 ] Although there is HA in phenotype C, PTX-3 levels are similar to the fertile group, and it is thought that factors other than HA also affect PTX-3 release.  Numerous studies have provided variable results on PTX3 levels in PCOS women. Some report higher PTX-3 expression in PCOS cases (compared to controls), while others report decreased PTX3 expression in PCOS. This difference between studies may be due to the pooling of patients with PCOS without separating them by phenotype and providing an overall conclusion. This idea is supported by a study in which PCOS cases were separated into obese and nonobese, and obese PCOS women had significantly higher serum PTX3 levels than nonobese PCOS subjects. [ 20 ] Therefore, our study is unique in that it tested whether serum PTX-3 levels in PCOS cases are affected by phenotypic variables. By separating patients into phenotypes, we were able to test the effects of phenotypic variables, such as HA, OD, PCOM, and endocrine and metabolic pathologies on PTX3 expression.  Decreased expression of ptx3 in phenotypes A and B may also be due to metabolic defects, as it has a regulatory role in insulin secretion, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory functions. In the PCOS group, increased homeostatic model evaluation and hyperinsulinemia may also play a role in the defective expression of ptx3. [ 18 ] The absence of HA in phenotype D may provide normal ptx3 release in patients in this group. There is no study on the effect of PCOM findings on ptx3. However, the presence of PCOM in both phenotype C and phenotype D may regulate normal ptx3 expression. Since Ptx3 expression is increased in cumulus cell expansion, PCOM may be responsible for the normal levels of ptx3 in phenotypes C and D. Consistent with this, increased ptx3 expression in the follicular fluids of women with PCOS has been reported. [ 18 ]  Possible reasons for the decrease in serum PTX3 levels in classical PCOS phenotypes compared to the control group and normoadrogenic phenotypes may be endocrine and metabolic pathologies. The fact that HA and IR are more prominent in classical phenotypes supports this idea. The fact that genes responsible for receptivity were reported to decrease in endometrial cell cultures exposed to testosterone and DHT suggests that HA decreases PTX3. [ 23 ] Contrary to the study reporting that IR increases PTX3, [ 22 ] in our study, PTX3 levels decreased despite the increase in the HOMA index. In addition to all these possible culprits that decrease serum PTX3, the decrease in PTX3 in the presence of nutritional deterioration and inflammation supports that chronic inflammation in PCOS may also be responsible for decreased PTX3. [ 24 ] Although we cannot determine a clear cause, syndrome-specific endocrine and metabolic pathologies may be responsible for PTX3 changes, indicating the need for more comprehensive studies.    5. Conclusion  In addition to the low number of cases among groups and phenotypes, the retrospective determination of participants and the inability to match the groups in terms of BMI are the limitations of the study. Despite all these limitations, the study is important in terms of presenting the first data showing PTX-3 changes according to the PCOS phenotype. The fact that the number of patients in the phenotype groups conforms to the classical phenotype distribution supports the clinical importance of our results. More studies with larger sample sizes and diverse populations are needed to reach a clear discussion. In particular, the investigation of PTX3 levels in endometrial tissue samples is important to clarify the relationship between PTX3 and implantation more clearly. Examination of PTX3 in endometrial sampling or flushing fluid is critical to reveal the role of the endometrium in PCOS-related subfertility.
