    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the commonest endocrine disorders amongst women of reproductive age, and is characterised by clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, chronic oligo/amenorrhea with or without polycystic ovary morphology [ 1 , 2 ]. It is associated with elevated risks of various metabolic comorbidities including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperlipidemia and non\u2010alcohol fatty liver disease, regardless of age and BMI [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. Current estimates indicate a global prevalence of 5.5%\u201319.9% and can be up to 70%\u201380% amongst women with oligomenorrhea, constituting a significant public health burden [ 8 , 9 ]. Although the epidemiological links between PCOS and these metabolic conditions are relatively well\u2010established, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear and are likely to involve interaction between disturbance of hormonal balance, alteration in cellular metabolism, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress [ 10 ].  Telomeres are specialised nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each DNA strand in the chromosomes of all eukaryotic cells. It is composed of tandem repeats of 5\u2032\u2010TTAGGG\u20103\u2032 sequences bound by shelterin to act as a protective structure of the DNA during cell division. Due to the abundance of guanine, telomeres are intrinsically sensitive to oxidative damage and are proposed to be a potential marker of cellular ageing as well as oxidative stress in humans [ 11 ]. Previous studies have reported shortened telomere length in numerous age\u2010related conditions including T2DM, chronic kidney disease, neurocognitive disorders and malignancies [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]. The association between gynaecological conditions, such as infertility, has also been implicated [ 17 , 18 ]. In PCOS, whether or not telomere length reflects and could serve as a potential marker for certain pathophysiological changes including cardiometabolic derangement, remains a question.  Several groups have evaluated the relationship between telomere length and PCOS, but the results have been inconsistent. A case\u2013control study reported significantly shorter leukocytes telomere length (LTL) in 698 subjects with PCOS, after adjusting for age and their results were echoed by another group in Brazil in 2020 [ 19 , 20 ]. However, some earlier studies have reported no differences in telomere length between women with PCOS and control [ 20 , 21 ]. A recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of six studies likewise concluded no significant difference in telomere length in women with or without PCOS [ 22 ]. Some of the discrepancies may be related to the variation in LTL measurements depending on the methods used, and these apparently contradicting results warrant further investigation into the association between telomere length and PCOS using more accurate assays [ 12 ]. Hence, the present study aims to compare the relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) in PCOS and control subjects, using a refined and medium throughput assay with greater accuracy [ 23 ]. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between rLTL and various clinical or biochemical characteristics in PCOS subjects, as well as explored causal links between PCOS and LTL.    2  Methods   2.1   PCOS Patients and Control Subjects  A total of 214 women with PCOS were recruited from the endocrine, combined gynae\u2010endocrine clinics and PCOS registry in the Prince of Wales Hospital. Baseline date was defined as the date of PCOS diagnosis by relevant endocrinologists or gynaecologists between September 1999 and April 2007. Each patient has been further confirmed to have PCOS based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria before enrolling to the present study. These patients were then followed\u2010up and re\u2010assessed between January 2016 and December 2017 [ 24 ]. Using the existing cohort, several studies have been conducted on the progression of cardiometabolic risk in women with PCOS [ 24 , 25 , 26 ].  Another 214 age\u2010matched (\u00b1\u20093\u2009years to the age of patients at follow\u2010up visits) control subjects were recruited from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, who had all previously conceived without assisted reproduction technology, and attended a follow\u2010up visit between 2009 and 2013, approximately 7\u2009years after delivery [ 25 , 27 ]. These subjects had been seen by obstetricians during pregnancy and never had a diagnosis of PCOS. They had normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy as screened by standard 75\u2010g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Subjects with hypothyroidism, prolactinoma, nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing's syndrome were excluded. This study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2010New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in the study.    2.2  Clinical, Anthropometrical and Biochemical Assessment  Personal history, medical history and drug history were documented with a standardised questionnaire. Metabolic risk factors including tobacco use and family history of diabetes were assessed. Oligo/amenorrhea was defined by <\u200910 menstrual periods in the year before the follow\u2010up. Clinical hyperandrogenism was evaluated by the degree of hirsutism, the frequency of hair removal and the methods used. We defined hirsutism by the modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey score with a cut\u2010off point of \u2265\u20093, as appropriate for East Asian subjects [ 1 , 28 ]. Body weight, body height, waist circumference and hip circumference were measured. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were obtained by averaging two readings by a standard sphygmomanometer on the right arm after at least 5\u2009min of rest.  Overnight\u2010fasting blood samples were collected in all subjects at the follow\u2010up visits, as this study aimed to explore the association between rLTL and cardiometabolic risk factors, which usually manifest with increasing age. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) and low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured. A 75\u2010g OGTT was performed in all subjects, unless there is a known diagnosis of DM, or if the subjects had undergone a recent OGTT prior to clinical assessment. In subjects with PCOS, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, estradiol (E 2 ), testosterone, androstenedione and sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG) were measured.  Plasma glucose, TC, TG, HDL and LDL were evaluated by appropriate enzymatic methods on the Cobas c702 Clinical Chemistry Analyser (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Insulin and SHBG were measured by Immunilite XPi2000 Analyser (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.). Electro\u2010chemiluminescent immunoassays on the Cobas c601 Immunoassay Analyser (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) were employed to measure LH, FSH and E 2 . Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) was used for the measurement of serum total testosterone and androstenedione [ 24 ]. Standardised reagent kits were supplied by the manufacturers and the analytical performance was within the specification of the analysers. The laboratory responsible for these tests is accredited by the National Association of Testing Authority, Australia (NATA) and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia against ISO15189:2012 for medical testing.    2.3  Outcomes Measures  Subjects with a body mass index \u2265\u200923\u2009kg/m 2 or a waist circumference \u2265\u200980\u2009cm were classified as being overweight or having central obesity, respectively. Dysglycemia was defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or DM by the 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria [ 29 ]. IFG was defined as FBG between 5.6\u2009mmol/L and 6.9\u2009mmol/L while IGT was defined as 2\u2010h plasma glucose between 7.8\u2009mmol/L and 11.0\u2009mmol/L. DM was defined by FBG \u2265\u20097\u2009mmol/L, 2\u2010h plasma glucose \u2265\u200911.1\u2009mmol/L or according to patient history in the standard questionaire. Hypertension was defined by the report from the Panel Members in the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8), or according to the questionaire. Subjects with TC \u2265\u20095.2\u2009mmol/L, TG \u2265\u20091.7\u2009mmol/L, HDL\u2010C\u2009<\u20091.3\u2009mmol/L, LDL\u2010C\u2009\u2265\u20093.4\u2009mmol/L, or treatment with lipid regulating drugs were considered to have dyslipidemia. Free androgen index (FAI) was calculated by 100\u00d7 (total testosterone (nmol/L))/SHBG (nmol/L). Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR), that is, fasting glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting insulin (mIU/L)/22.5.    2.4  Measurement of Relative Leukocytes Telomere Length and Estimated Absolute Leukocytes Telomere Length  Whole blood samples of all subjects were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until retrieval for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted by the phenol\u2010chloroform method. We measured rLTL as per an updated quantitative real\u2010time PCR protocol and reported it as \u0394\u0394Ct between telomere and a single\u2010copy gene encoding \u03b2\u2010globin (HBG) relative to a normalisation control [ 23 ]. With this protocol, intra\u2010assay CV <\u20092% and inter\u2010assay CV <\u20094% were achieved, alongside high reproducibility from three users in two different laboratories [ 23 ]. Quality control was achieved by inclusion of a no\u2010template control (NTC) and a reference human DNA sample (QC), which allowed normalisation of plate\u2010to\u2010plate variability, as well as the calculation of \u0394\u0394Ct. Currently, there is no consensus on the most appropriate normalisation method for rLTL measurement and calculation based on either NTC or QC was generally considered acceptable. In the present study, we used QC for normalisation. For PCOS subjects, we utilised the DNA sample during the follow\u2010up visit for measurement of LTL, as this was the timepoint at which subjects were matched. The CV of each sample was <\u20092.5%. The overall intra\u2010plate CVs were 1.06% and 0.64% for telomere and HBG respectively, while the inter\u2010plate CVs were 1.74% and 0.84%.  We also estimated absolute LTL from whole\u2010genome\u2010sequencing (WGS) data for whole blood samples using Telseq software [ 30 , 31 ]. Telseq defines the reads which contained seven or more TTAGGG repeats as telomeres, and thereby calculates the relative proportion of telomeric reads amongst all sequenced reads and transforms this value into absolute telomere length. From our previous analyses, one unit of rLTL measured using our assay was equivalent to 4.999 kilobases of absolute LTL estimated from WGS [ 31 ].    2.5  Data Sources and SNP Selection for Mendelian Randomization Analysis  Full\u2010genetic instrument variables (IVs) for rTL were obtained from a GWAS study including 472,174 well\u2010characterised participants of European descent using the UK Biobank Resource [ 15 ] and the relevant summary statistics for PCOS were obtained from the Day et\u00a0al. study, which is a large GWAS meta\u2010analysis with 4138 cases and 20,129 controls collated from six European cohorts [ 32 ]. The rationale for performing the MR analysis based on Europoean populations is due to the much larger sample size available for the GWAS and hence stronger instrumental variables available in European populations as opposed to East Asian populations, and the expectation that causal relationships established in one population should not be ethnicity\u2010specific, but should be applicable for other populations.  We employed a conventional threshold of genome\u2010wide significance ( p <\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 ) to select the candidates of genetic instruments for the exposure trait. We further removed correlated SNPs by setting a linkage disequilibrium threshold of r  2 <\u20090.001. We retained the independent SNPs with the lowest p \u2010values within a 10,000\u2010kb window. These SNPs were then harmonised with the outcome GWAS summary statistics, where SNPs were discarded if they were either palindromic or not available in the outcome GWAS. The remaining SNPs were used as the final instrumental variables (IVs) for exposure. To validate the instrument strength assumption for MR analysis, we estimated the proportion of variance in the exposure explained by genetic variants ( R  2 ) using the formula:  R 2 \u2248 \u2211 i K \u03b2 i 2 \u03b2 i 2 + N se \u03b2 i 2  where \u03b2  i is the effect size of genetic instrument variant i , N is the effective sample size, se( \u03b2  i ) is the standard error of effect size for the genetic variant i , and K is the number of independent genetic variants [ 33 ]. We then calculated the F \u2010statistic by F =\u2009(( N \u2212K\u22121) R  2 )/(K(1\u2212 R  2 )) and compared it with the empirical threshold 10 to evaluate the strength of these genetic instruments.  The current MR analyses were performed using published GWAS datasets. No specific ethical approval and written informed consent of participants is required for the MR analyses.    2.6  Statistical Analysis  rLTL beyond two standard deviations from the mean of either group were excluded from analysis, alongside their matched samples, which included four cases and seven controls together with their matched samples. The distribution of variables was assessed by skewness and kurtosis test. Demographic information was presented in mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD or median (interquartile range) for continuous data, and frequency (percentage) for categorical data. Qualitative and quantitative differences between subjects with PCOS and control subjects were analysed by chi\u2010square test for categorical variable, and unpaired t \u2010test or Mann\u2013Whitney test for continuous variable, whichever is appropriate. Simple and multivariable logistic regression were applied to examine the association of rLTL/estimated absolute LTL and PCOS. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the potential causal relationship between PCOS stuatus, cardiometabolic risk factors and rLTL. Subgroup analyses were performed in subjects with PCOS to evaluate the relationship between rLTL and their clinical/biochemical characteristics. Linear and logistic regression were used for continuous and dichotomous variables respectively. Multivariable analyses were performed to examine the independent association between rLTL and these parameters. We also defined shortened rLTL as rLTL\u2009<\u2009mean rLTL in control subjects to calculate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios between risk of dysglycemia, hypertension, central obesity and shortened rLTL by logistic regression. The MR analyses were undertaken using the R packages TwoSampleMR. The inverse variance\u2010weighted (IVW) method was used as the determinant of the causal effects of exposure on outcome. We also performed maximum likelihood, weighted median, weighted mode and MR\u2010Egger methods for validating the primary findings from IVW. Other sensitivity tests including the heterogeneity test (Cochrane's Q test), pleiotropy test (MR\u2010Egger intercept test), and leave\u2010one\u2010out test were also performed [ 33 ]. Statistical significance was taken as p <\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were two\u2010tailed and performed using R version 4.0.2.     3  Results   3.1  Baseline and Follow\u2010Up Characteristics of Women With PCOS and Controls  A total of 203 women with PCOS and 203 control subjects were included in the statistical analyses. At the time of previous assessment, 85 (58.2%), 159 (97.0%) and 138 (92.6%) of the PCOS subjects had clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, oligo/amenorrhea and polycystic morphology respectively, whilst 46 (22.7%), 75 (36.9%) and 22 (10.8%) of them had dysglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension.  Compared with the controls, women with PCOS at the follow\u2010up visits were older and had greater body weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist\u2010hip ratio (WHR), SBP, DBP, TG, FBG, insulin, blood glucose 2\u2010h post\u2010OGTT and HOMA\u2010IR (all p <\u20090.05). They also had lower HDL, HOMA\u2010B and shorter rLTL. More of them were overweight/obese and more had DM, dysglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, central obesity and family history of DM (all p <\u20090.05). It is estimated that absolute LTL amongst PCOS subjects was 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 kilobase pair, compared to 15.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094 kilobase pair amongst controls.  Androgen and other sex hormones were measured only in the PCOS subjects and the data were presented in Table 1 . Meanwhile, control subjects had no clinical features of PCOS, although the androgen level had not been measured. Control women have all previously conceived without receiving any assisted reproduction technology. The baseline and follow\u2010up characteristics of women with PCOS and controls were summarised in Table 1 .

The 6 models were summarised in Table 2 . In the univariable analysis, rLTL was negatively associated with PCOS (OR: 0.482; 95% CI: 0.342\u20130.668; p <\u20090.001). To adjust for the effects of age and other cardiometabolic traits on rLTL, five multivariable models were constructed. The association remained significant after serial adjustment for age, waist circumference, smoking, HOMA\u2010IR and LDL (OR: 0.503; 95% CI: 0.342\u20130.730; p <\u20090.001) and each unit increase in rLTL was associated with a roughly 49.7% reduction in the risk of PCOS. Sensitivity analyses were performed by adjusting for BMI instead of waist circumference, as well as fasting glucose instead of HOMA\u2010IR, which generated similar results (Table S8 ). Based on the absolute LTL data extrapolated from WGS, 1 kilobase increase in absolute LTL was associated with a 10% reduction in risk of PCOS (OR: 0.900; 95% CI: 0.857\u20130.944, p <\u20090.001), which remained significant after adjustment (OR: 0.906; 95% CI: 0.857\u20130.956; p <\u20090.001) (Table S7 ).

While PCOS is known to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, all of which were shown to be correlated with shorter rLTL, the negative relation between PCOS and rLTL appeared to be independent [ 12 , 34 , 35 ]. Nonetheless, the overall effects can be partially mediated. To further illustrate the direct effects of PCOS and to evaluate for the possible causal mediation effects by the cardiometabolic traits, mediation analysis was performed as shown in Table S9 with illustration as Figure 1 . In all four models assessing the mediating effects of central obesity, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia and hypertension, the average direct effects of PCOS remained significant (all p <\u20090.05). Additionally, PCOS is associated with shorter rLTL through the effects of dyslipidemia and dysglycemia, but not central obesity or hypertension. The estimated proportion of effects mediated by dyslipidemia and dysglycemia were 49.1% [CI: 9.6%\u201399.8%; p =\u20090.014] and 11.5% [CI: 2.2%\u201326.7%; p =\u20090.012] respectively.   FIGURE 1   Mediation analysis showing dysglycemia and dyslipidemia partially mediated the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL). Data can be referred to Table S9 .       3.3  The Association of rLTL and Cardiometabolic Traits/Sex Hormones in PCOS Subjects  We further assessed the correlation between rLTL and various metabolic traits/sex hormones amongst women with PCOS (Table 3 ). An inverse association was identified between rLTL and LDL using simple linear regression ( \u03b2 =\u2009\u22120.235; p =\u20090.006), while longer rLTL was associated with increased HDL ( \u03b2 =\u20090.105; p =\u20090.048). TG, FBG and HOMA IR were not correlated. The association between rLTL and LDL remained significant after adjusting for age, but was rendered non\u2010significant after further adjusting for waist circumference. The association between rLTL and HDL was lost after adjusting for age. Testosterone, androstenedione and LH/FSH ratio, the hallmark hormonal changes in PCOS, were not associated with rLTL after adjustment, although higher level of testosterone and androstenedione appear to be linked to longer rLTL in univariate analyses. A summary of the linear regression models is presented in Table 3 .

Whether or not the association will be significant only when the cardiometabolic traits deviate more from the normal range remained unclear. We hence assessed the possible links between rLTL and cardiometabolic outcomes in women with PCOS, using logistic regression (Table 4 ). rLTL was negatively associated with dysglycemia and dyslipidemia (both p <\u20090.05) on univariable analyses, but not central obesity or hypertension. Three multiple logistic regression models were then constructed (model 2\u20134) to evaluate the independent association between rLTL and these outcomes. After adjusting for age, waist circumference and DM, rLTL was significantly correlated with dyslipidemia (OR: 0.563; 95% CI: 0.317\u20130.968; p =\u20090.042). The association between rLTL and dysglycemia was no longer significant after adjusting for age. We also defined short rLTL as rLTL less than the mean rLTL of controls to assess the correlation of shortened rLTL with central obesity, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension (Table 4 ). Interestingly, shortened rLTL was associated with increased odds of dysglycemia, after adjusting for age, waist circumference and family history of DM (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.04\u20134.29; p =\u20090.040). It was also correlated with an increased odds of central obesity after adjusting for age (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.01\u20133.30; p =\u20090.047). The association between shortened rLTL and dyslipidemia was significant after adjusting for age, but lost after further adjusting for waist circumference.

Given that larger sample sizes and a larger number of identified SNPs would help to robustness of MR analyses, we chose to undertake the MR analyses using data from the European population, where there is more available genetic data. A total of 153 SNPs significantly associated with rLTL were obtained (Table S1 ). The SNPs explained 3.57% of the variance for rLTL, and the corresponding F\u2010statistic was 114.37. In MR analysis, the standard IVW method indicated no causal effects of rLTL on PCOS (OR\u2009=\u20090.861, 95% CI 0.650\u20131.142, p =\u20090.299) (Table S3 ; Figure 1 ). We also applied sensitivity analyses including maximum likelihood, weighted median, weighted mode and MR\u2010Egger methods, which yielded similar results (Table S3 ; Figure 1 ). Heterogeneity tests indicated no heterogeneity of the genetic variants for PCOS ( p =\u20090.182) (Table S4 ), and pleiotropy tests indicated no pleiotropy of the genetic variants ( p =\u20090.676) (Table S4 ). Leave\u2010one\u2010out analysis indicated that the results were still well\u2010powered and stable even if any single SNP is excluded (Figure S1 ). Altogether, our results indicated no causal effects of rLTL on PCOS by MR analysis.    3.6  The Causal Effects of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome on Telomere Length  To further explore the reverse association between rLTL and PCOS, we further performed bidirectional MR analysis to estimate the causal effects of PCOS on rLTL. Specifically, 14 SNPs significantly associated with PCOS were obtained, respectively (Table S2 ). By using the IVW method, our results indicated no causal effects of PCOS ( \u03b2 =\u2009\u22126.75E\u201004, 95% CI \u22120.015 to 1.014, p =\u20090.927) on rLTL (Table S5 ). Sensitivity analyses returned consistent results (Table S5 ; Figure 1 ). No heterogeneity was identified in the analysis ( p =\u20090.141) (Table 3 ). The pleiotropy test indicated no pleiotropy ( p =\u20090.317) amongst the genetic variants (Table S6 ). Leave\u2010one\u2010out analysis indicated that the results of our analysis had sufficient power (Figure S2 ). Taken together, our results indicated no causal effects of PCOS on rLTL by MR analysis.     4  Discussion  In the present study, we used an updated and refined real\u2010time quantitative PCR assay to evaluate the association between rLTL and PCOS, as well as that between rLTL and metabolic traits/outcomes. Our main findings were: (1) rLTL was independently and inversely associated with PCOS in Chinese subjects after adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, HOMA IR and LDL. (2) The shorter rLTL in PCOS patients is partially mediated through dyslipidemia and dysglycemia, while a direct effect of PCOS is also present. (3) Shorter rLTL was associated with cardiometabolic traits amongst PCOS patients. (4) Bi\u2010directional Mendelian Randomization analysis suggest no causal relations between genetically determined PCOS and telomere length.   4.1  Women With PCOS Have Shorter rLTL Compared With Control  To date, there have been several studies comparing the telomere length in women with and without PCOS. In line with our data, Li et\u00a0al. reported shorter rLTL in PCOS subjects in their study consisting of 698 PCOS subjects and 611 healthy controls, which is the largest cohort thus far [ 19 ]. Meanwhile, contradictory findings were produced from two similar but smaller studies. Pedroso et\u00a0al. reported a cohort of 150 PCOS patients and 124 healthy controls, and they found no significant difference in LTL [ 21 ]. Another study from Argentina, including 170 PCOS patients and 64 controls, reported longer telomere length in the PCOS group [ 36 ]. These discrepancies highlighted the complexity of telomere biology and could potentially represent the effects of various factors including differences in clinical characteristics, methodological variability in LTL measurements as well as the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCOS.  While real\u2010time quantitative PCR\u2010based assay offers a relatively simple and high\u2010throughput workflow for rLTL measurements, issues around variability and reproducibility have been a concern. Although overall the assays are similar between groups, subtle differences, such as the reference single copy gene, could have substantial effects on the results. For example, the single\u2010copy gene 36B4/RPLP0 used in the work by Pedroso et\u00a0al. is known to have multiple processed pseudogenes, which makes it unsuitable as a reference gene [ 37 ]. In the present study, we employed an optimised protocol which has been previously shown to have low intra\u2010plate and inter\u2010plate CVs with high reproducibility [ 23 ]. In addition, both the present study and that by Li et\u00a0al. consisted of Chinese subjects, while the other two studies recruited participants from the South America. Racial and ethnic differences have been shown to be associated with different clinical manifestations, phenotypes, sex hormone profile and cardiometabolic risks in women with PCOS, which could potentially influence rLTL [ 38 , 39 , 40 ]. Notably, Asian patients with PCOS have been reported to have milder hyperandrogenic phenotypes but higher cardiometabolic risk, both of which could be associated with shorter rLTL [ 12 , 36 , 41 ]. Third, the discrepancy in androgen levels across various studies may partly explain the differences as testosterone may be associated with longer LTL in PCOS patients, as reported in one of the previous studies and by the simple linear regression in our cohort, as discussed in the next section\u00a0[ 36 ]. In our study, the mean testosterone level or percentage of patients with hyperandrogenism was significantly lower than in the abovementioned studies (1.40\u2009nmol/L vs. 3.12\u2009nmol/L) (58.2% vs. 84.2%). These factors may have contributed to our study detecting a clear difference in rLTL and an inverse relation between rLTL and PCOS using logistic regression.    4.2  Cardiometabolic Traits Partially, but Not Fully, Mediate the Effects of PCOS on rLTL   Notably, previous literature suggested an inverse association between telomere length and numerous cardiometabolic traits including BMI, WHR, LDL, FBG, HOMA\u2010IR, SBP and DBP in the general population, while PCOS patients are known to be at risk of these metabolic derangement [ 12 ].  To our knowledge, although the aforementioned studies aimed to compare the telomere length amongst PCOS and control subjects, we are the first group to investigate both the independent association and the potential indirect effects of PCOS on rLTL through known cardiometabolic confounders of shortened rLTL. In our study, we were able to, for the first time, demonstrated that rLTL remained independently inversely associated with PCOS after adjusting for various cardiometabolic traits, in contrast with the previous study which only adjusted for age [ 19 ]. We also further dissected the potential causal\u2010mediation relations between PCOS, cardiometabolic outcomes and rLTL by mediation analysis. We were able to show that dysglycemia and dyslipidemia partially contributed to the shortened rLTL in PCOS patients, while there remained a direct effect of PCOS on rLTL that could not be accounted by the metabolic derangements. This implicates the presence of other pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the difference in rLTL.  In women with PCOS, we found that androgen levels, including testosterone and androstenedione, were positively correlated with rLTL in simple linear models (Testosterone: \u03b2 =\u20090.141; p =\u20090.046; Androstenedione: \u03b2 =\u20090.536; p =\u20090.028), suggesting the potential effects of androgens on telomere length. Interestingly, the associations as shown with our data became non\u2010significant after adjusting for age. Whether the named association represents a true biological relation, or it only reflects the higher androgen levels in younger women remained unclear and warranted further investigations. Owing to the lack of data on sex hormone levels in the control subjects, we have not been able to compare both groups and to further evaluate the effects of hormonal disturbance.  Hence, how PCOS is related to shortened rLTL beyond metabolic derangement require further efforts, and could potentially be due to hormonal disturbance, chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress and other mechanisms in PCOS subjects [ 42 ]. Of note, increased circulating inflammatory markers such as homocysteine, interleukin\u20106, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and so forth, have been shown in women with PCOS [ 42 ]. Markers of oxidative stress, such as reduced GSH/GSSH ratio, increased level of reactive oxygen species from mononuclear cells, and upregulated superoxide dismutase activity have also been demonstrated [ 43 , 44 ]. Whether these represent the underlying mechanisms of shortening of rLTL in PCOS subjects remains unclear.    4.3  Association of Metabolic Traits and rLTL in PCOS Subjects  Adding to earlier studies, our group is also the first to evaluate the relationship between rLTL and a comprehensive panel of cardiometabolic traits in PCOS subjects. In addition to Li et\u00a0al.'s study, which explored the relations between LTL and glycemic indices, we further investigated the association between rLTL, adiposity, lipid profile and blood pressure in PCOS subjects. Similar to their analyses, no significant relationship was found between glycemic indices and rLTL, but we reported that rLTL was positively associated with HDL and inversely associated with LDL in univariable analyses. The loss of association after adjusting for waist circumference may suggest the critical role of visceral adiposity in lipid derangement, as well as shortened rLTL in PCOS patients. There is strong evidence that aberrant adipocyte function in PCOS women could lead to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and subclinical inflammation [ 45 , 46 , 47 ]. Visceral adiposity has been reported to be associated with shorter LTL as well [ 12 ].  Furthermore, when dyslipidemia was defined as a composite outcome representing derangement in one or more lipid traits, namely HDL, LDL and/or TG, the association becomes more robust. It remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounders including age, waist circumference and DM. Dysglycemia, also defined with both fasting glucose and/or OGTT, also correlated with shortened rLTL in PCOS patients after adjusting for age, waist circumference and family history of DM. These results further supported that rLTL is closely related to cardiometabolic traits in PCOS patients, and could serve as a potential biomarker reflecting the burden of these traits.    4.4  No Direct Causal Relation Between PCOS and rLTL   Given the significantly shorter rLTL in PCOS subjects, we performed a bi\u2010directional Mendelian Randomization analysis to assess whether there is a causal links between rLTL and PCOS, or vice versa. The negative results suggested no evidence of causal relations and again, the shortened rLTL in PCOS is likely to be mediated by other factors such as metabolic changes, hormonal disturbance and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in PCOS [ 42 , 46 ]. Further studies may be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which rLTL are shortened in PCOS patients.    4.5  Limitation  The present study provided evidence that TL attrition may be associated with PCOS and its cardiometabolic consequences. However, it is not without limitation. First, this study is not powered to detect relatively weak association given the limited sample size. Second, although the optimised PCR\u2010based assay may contribute to higher reproducibility, it only reflects the relative average LTL, instead of providing a detailed profiling of TL distribution across different chromosomes and cells. Third, the potential relationship between rLTL and sex hormone level cannot be evaluated due to the lack of sex hormone measurement in the control group.     5  Conclusions  Chinese women with PCOS have significantly shortened rLTL compared to controls. rLTL is inversely associated with the risk of PCOS, independently of metabolic traits. Shortened rLTL is associated with an increased risk of dyslipidemia and dysglycemia in women with PCOS.
