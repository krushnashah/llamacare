    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) stands out as one of the prevalent endocrine-metabolic disorders, significantly impacting female fertility, with a reported global prevalence ranging from 4\u201321% 1 . PCOS is Characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism, and patients often experience various metabolic disturbances, including insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia 2 , 3 . Furthermore, PCOS is associated with several potential complications, such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, endometrial cancer, and chronic inflammatory conditions, all of which severely compromise reproductive health and quality of life 4 , 5 . Despite extensive research, the precise etiology of PCOS remains unclear, and there is a lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions, highlighting the need for the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies.  Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of gut microbiota in the progression and pathogenesis of PCOS 6 . Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota can compromise the integrity of the intestinal mucosal, resulting in increased intestinal mucosal permeability 7 \u2013 9 . lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative gut bacteria activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which in turn triggers downstream MyD88-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling, promoting a pro-inflammatory milieu 10 \u2013 13 . The activated NF-\u03baB induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to low-grade systemic and ovarian inflammation, disrupted follicular development, and the subsequent onset of PCOS 11 , 14 , 15 .  Curcumin, a polyphenolic lipophilic compound derived from turmeric, is reputed for its diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antioxidant properties 16 \u2013 18 . Research suggests that curcumin may help delay the onset and progression of T2DM by improving intestinal permeability, strengthening the intestinal barrier function, reducing circulating LPS levels, and mitigating systemic low-grade inflammation. PCOS is also characterized as an endocrine disorder with a state of chronic inflammation 18 , 19 . However, whether curcumin can prevent the progression of PCOS by improving intestinal barrier function and inhibiting the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has not yet been reported.  In this study, leveraging a murine PCOS model, we aimed to elucidate the effects of curcumin on PCOS pathogenesis and uncover the underlying mechanisms involved. Our findings provide insights into the complex interplay between PCOS, intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, and inflammation, potentially paving the way for novel clinical interventions.    Methods   Animal experiments  The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Southwest Medical University (NO. KY2020031), and were reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines 20 . All methods followed relevant guidelines and regulations. In this study, 21-day-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Chengdu Dossy Experimental Animals Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China, and housed in specialized cages with a controlled temperature (25\u2009\u00b1\u20091 \u00b0C) under a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (15 mice/group): control group (CON), CON with curcumin group (CON/CUR), model group (MOD), and MOD with curcumin group (MOD/CUR). According to the previous method 21 \u2013 23 , The mice in the MOD and MOD/CUR groups were subcutaneously injected with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g BW) dissolved in soybean oil for 20 days to induce the PCOS model. PCOS mice with successful induction exhibited acyclic/irregular ovarian cyclicity. The CON and CON/CUR groups received daily injections of an equivalent amount of soybean oil.  After 20 days, the mice in the CON/CUR and MOD/CUR groups received Curcumin (200\u00a0mg/kg) dissolved in 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for 45 days. Meanwhile, the CON and MOD groups were administered an equivalent dosage of 1% CMC as a control. After the 45-dayintervention, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine (20\u00a0mg/kg) and xylazine (3\u00a0mg/kg). The state of anesthesia was confirmed by observing slow breathing, muscle relaxation, and no response to experimental manipulation. Blood was then collected using the eyeball extraction method, centrifuged at 4000\u00a0rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further serum analysis. The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Ovarian and colon samples were collected immediately after euthanasia and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C for subsequent analysis.    Vaginal smear  From the first day of modeling to the last day of treatment, vaginal smears were collected at 9:00 AM to evaluate the estrous cycle of all mice using Wright-Giemsa staining microscopy. In normal mice, the estrous cycle progresses in the order of proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus, typically lasting 4\u20135 days 24 . A prolonged estrous cycle or a disordered pattern is considered indicative of an estrous cycle disorder 25 .    Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining  After the mice were sacrificed, the isolated ovary and colon tissues were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histological analysis. To evaluate ovarian and colon damage, the sections were with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed for morphological changes using an Olympus light microscope (Melville, NY).\u00a0For the stained ovarian sections, the number of cystic follicle and corpora luteum was counted by two individuals who were blinded to the source of the sections. As described in previous literature, cystic follicles are defined as follicles without oocytes, characterized by large fluid-filled cysts with a thin granulosa cell layer and a thick theca cell layer 19 .    Insulin tolerance tests (ITT)  ITT were performed immediately after 45 days of curcumin treatment. After fasting the mice for 6\u00a0h, basal blood glucose levels of mice in each group were measured. Subsequently, intraperitoneal insulin (1 IU/kg body weight) was injected immediately, and blood glucose levels were measured at 30, 60, and 90\u00a0min post-injection. The total area under the glucose response curve (AUC) was calculated using GraphPad Prism software.    Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  To measure the levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in plasma, as well as the levels of various inflammatory factors, including TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-\u03b1), IL-6 (interleukin-6, IL-6), IL-10 and IL-17\u00a0A in ovaries and plasma, ELISA was conducted following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions (Jiangsu Enzyme Immune Industrial Co., Ltd, Yancheng, China).    Western blot analysis  The total protein concentration of frozen ovarian tissue and colon tissue was determined using BCA protein assay kit. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder for 2\u00a0h. Following this, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibodies, which included TLR-4, MyD88, NF-\u03baB p65, occludin, and ZO-1. The PVDF membrane was washed three times with TBST. Primary antibodies for TLR-4, MyD88, and NF-\u03baB p65\u00a0were purchased from Wuhan Sanying Biotechnology Co., LTD., and those for occludin and ZO-1 were purchased from Beijing Bioss Biotechnology Co., LTD. The dilution ratio of all primary antibodies was 1:2000.  Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2\u00a0h at room temperature and washed three times with TBST. Chemiluminescence was used for color development, with GAPDH as the internal reference. The band intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software, and the blot of each protein was captured using a gel imaging system.    Immunohistochemistry  Paraffin slices underwent an antigen unmasking process and were treated with 3% H 2 O 2 to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. Following this, the tissues were incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin for 60\u00a0min to block nonspecific binding. The slices were then incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibodies: anti-occludin (13409-1-AP, Proteintech) and anti-ZO-1 (21773-1-AP, Proteintech).  On the following day, the slices were incubated with the corresponding HRP labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 60\u00a0min. Finally, the slices were stained with DAB and examined under a light microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification.    Plasma LPS analysis  Limulus amebocyte lysate kit was used to detect the plasma LPS levels of mice in each group (Xiamen Bioendo Technology Co., Ltd, Xiamen, China). According to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, 50 \u00b5L of diluted plasma (diluted 1:4 with endotoxin-free water) was added to each well of a 96-well plate. Subsequently, 50 \u00b5L/ well of limulus amebocyte lysate reagent was added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After incubation, 100 \u00b5L of chromogenic, pre-warmed to 37 \u00b0 C, was added to each well. the plates were incubated again at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0min. The reaction was terminated by adding 100\u00b5L of 25% glacial acetic acid solution. Finally, the optical density of the microplate at 545\u00a0nm was measured using a reader (Thermo Scientific, USA).    Statistical analysis  All experimental data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software 6.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). The results were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Differences among multiple comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used to identify the significance of pairwise comparison of mean values among the groups. Results with p\u2009< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.     Results   Routine parameters of mice in diverse groups  At the beginning of the study, there were no significant differences in body weights among 4 groups. After 45 days of treatment, the body weight of mice in MOD/CUR group decreased significantly compared with that in MOD group( p\u2009= 0.0254), and there was no significant change in body weight of mice in CON/CUR group compared with that in CON group, indicating that curcumin effectively reduced weight in PCOS mice.  T and LH levels were significantly higher in MOD group compared to the CON group (T, p <\u20090.0001; LH, p\u2009= 0.0030). Compared with the MOD group, T and LH levels were significantly lower in the MOD/CUR group (T, p\u2009= 0.0052; LH, p\u2009= 0.0438). Additionally, the LH/FSH ratio in the MOD group was significantly higher than that in the CON group ( p\u2009= 0.0025), while the LH/FSH ratio in the MOD/CUR group was notably lower than in the MOD group ( p\u2009= 0.0415). FSH levels were significantly lower in the MOD group compared to the CON group ( p\u2009= 0.0481), with no differences observed between the MOD and MOD/CUR groups. Furthermore, estradiol (E2) levels in the MOD group were significantly lower than in the CON group ( p =\u20090.0053), but curcumin intervention significantly increased E2 levels compared to the MOD group ( p =\u20090.0498) (Table 1 ).

Curcumin intervention improved the estrous cycles of PCOS in mice  Wright-Giemsa staining was performed on vaginal smears to evaluate differences in estrous cycles of mice in each group (Fig. 1 ). The CON (Fig. 1 E) and CON/CUR (Fig. 1 F) groups showed a regular estrous cycle, lasting 4\u20135 days. In contrast, as the modeling progressed, the estrous cycle in the MOD group became disordered, with a prolonged estrus phase (Fig. 1 G). Remarkably, after curcumin intervention, the estrous cycle of mice in the MOD/CUR group gradually returned to normal (Fig. 1 H), indicating that curcumin can improve the estrous cycle disorder associated with PCOS.

Curcumin ameliorated ovarian histopathological injury in PCOS  HE staining was used to assess the alteration of ovarian pathology in mice from each group (Fig. 2 A-D). Compared to the CON group, the MOD group exhibited a significant increase in the number of cystic follicles ( p =\u20090.0022) and a reduction or absence of corpus luteum ( p =\u20090.0388), indicating impaired ovarian function Intriguingly, curcumin intervention resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cystic follicles ( p\u2009= 0.0488) and an increase in corpus luteum formation ( p\u2009= 0.0388), indicating that curcumin helps improve pathological changes in ovarian tissue (Fig. 2 E\u2013F).

Original magnification (40\u00d7).      Curcumin improved insulin resistance in PCOS  According to area under the curve AUC from insulin tolerance tests, Insulin sensitivity in the MOD group was significantly lower than in the CON group (p\u2009= 0.0092). However, insulin sensitivity was increased in the MOD/CUR group ( p\u2009= 0.0441) compared to the MOD group (Fig. 3 ).   Fig. 3 Insulin tolerance test.

Curcumin improved the mucosal barrier of colon  colonic tissue revealed significant pathological injury in the MOD group, characterized by colon mucosal erosion, disordered and sparse villus structure, and discontinuous brush border. In contrast, curcumin intervention alleviated these issues, showing reduced mucosal erosion, improved villus structure, and continuity of the brush border. These findings indicate that curcumin helps improve the pathological changes in colon tissue (Fig. 4 A\u2013D).

Original magnification (200\u00d7). * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01.    Western blot showed that, compared to the CON group, the levels of colon tissue ZO-1 ( p\u2009= 0.0043) and occludin ( p\u2009= 0.0010) were significantly decreased in the MOD group. In the MOD/CUR group, curcumin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of ZO-1 ( p =\u20090.0360) and occludin ( p =\u20090.0189) compared to the MOD group. These results indicate that curcumin can enhance the levels of ZO-1 and Occludin in colonic tissue, thereby ameliorating the intestinal mucosal barrier (Fig. 4 E\u2013G).  To assess the effects of curcumin on intestinal barrier integrity, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of tight junction proteins, including occluding (Fig. 5 A\u2013D) and ZO-1(Fig. 5 E\u2013H). Compared to the CON group, the levels of occludin ( p =\u20090.0002) and ZO-1 ( p =\u20090.0001) were significantly decreased in the MOD group. However, compared with the MOD group, the expression of both occludin ( p =\u20090.0224) and ZO-1 ( p =\u20090.0273) was significantly increased in the MOD/CUR group. These results suggest that curcumin may improve intestinal barrier function by enhancing the expression of occludin (Fig. 5 I) and ZO-1 proteins (Fig. 5 J).

Curcumin reduced inflammation of plasma and ovary in PCOS  Experimental analysis revealed that the levels of IL-17\u00a0A (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0031; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0090) (Fig. 6 A and E), IL-6 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0139; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0233) (Fig. 6 B and F), and TNF-\u03b1 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0033; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0280) (Fig. 6 D and H)were significantly elevated in the MOD group compared to the CON group, while the level of IL-10 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0041; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0086) (Fig. 6 C and G) was significantly lower. Following curcumin intervention, levels of IL-17\u00a0A (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0120; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0414), IL-6 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0344; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0379), and TNF-\u03b1 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0078; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0488) were significantly decreased, and the level of IL-10 (plasma, p\u2009= 0.0270; ovary, p\u2009= 0.0267) was significantly increased(Fig. 6 A and H). These results indicate that curcumin reduced inflammation in the plasma and ovaries of PCOS by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing anti-inflammatory IL-10.   Fig. 6 Detection of plasma or ovarian inflammatory in diverse groups of mice. ( A \u2013 D ) Plasma in each group was collected respectively for detection of IL-17\u00a0A ( A ), IL-6 ( B ), IL-10 ( C ), TNF-\u03b1 ( D ).

Curcumin attenuated metabolic endotoxemia by decreasing LPS and TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway  Plasma-translocated LPS derived from Gram-negative bacteria was detected with Limulus reagent. Compared to the CON group, plasma LPS was significantly increased in the MOD group ( p\u2009= 0.0012). However, plasma LPS was significantly lower in the MOD/CUR group compared to the MOD group ( p\u2009= 0.0144), indicating that curcumin can reduce endotoxemia in PCOS (Fig. 6 I). In addition, the relative expression of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 was significantly elevated in the MOD group ( p\u2009= 0.0100, p\u2009= 0.0004, p\u2009= 0.0020) but these levels were reduced following curcumin administration ( p\u2009= 0.0462, p\u2009= 0.0152, p\u2009= 0.0229) (Fig. 6 L, K, J, M, J and K).     Discussion  In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of curcumin for treating PCOS. Through various conventional indicators such as pathological examination, weight loss, improvement in insulin resistance, and normalization of abnormal hormone levels, we established that curcumin effectively alleviates PCOS symptoms, aligning with previous research findings 26 \u2013 32 . Our results demonstrated that curcumin offers promising preventive and therapeutic benefits for PCOS management. Furthermore, our study suggest that the amelioration of PCOS phenotype may be closely associated with the reduction in intestinal mucosal permeability and the inhibition of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.  Numerous studies have shown that dysregulation of gut microbiota in PCOS leads to increased intestinal mucosal permeability 33 \u2013 35 . This disruption allows LPS translocation from gram-negative bacteria to enter the bloodstream, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation and subsequent ovarian inflammation 10 , 11 , 36 . Our findings demonstrated marked colonic tissue pathology in the MOD group, with decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin) and elevated plasma LPS levels. Remarkably, curcumin intervention ameliorated colonic pathological damage, increased tight junction protein expression, and decreased plasma LPS levels. These results suggest that curcumin may reduce intestinal mucosal permeability, reduce intestinal LPS transport to the liver and blood circulation, and eventually contributing to the reduction of ovarian inflammation.  Proinflammatory cytokines were increased and anti-inflammatory cytokines decreased in PCOS 37 , 38 . Notably, aberrant levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-17\u00a0A in plasma and follicular fluid have been associated with poor oocyte quality and compromised reproductive outcomes 37 , 39 , 40 . These cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10, play crucial roles in the occurrence and development of inflammation and oxidative stress 19 . Our study showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This suggests that curcumin may help alleviate PCOS by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is consistent with findings from previous studies 18 , 41 , 42 .  The TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB is crucial for the LPS-induced intestinal innate immune response, particularly in PCOS 12 , 43 , 44 , and is known to exacerbate insulin resistance 15 , 16 . Activation of TLR4 by LPS from Gram-negative gut bacteria triggers downstream MyD88-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling. creating a pro-inflammatory environment that contributes to low-grade systemic and ovarian inflammation 10 \u2013 13 . Our study demonstrated that curcumin intervention effectively down-regulated the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB p65 in ovarian tissue, suggesting that curcumin may reduce the inflammatory cascade and, consequently, alleviate PCOS.  In this study, several limitations should be considered. the role of curcumin in improving gut microbiota and its impact on intestinal mucosal permeability and ovarian inflammation in PCOS remains unclear. Future research will be needed to address these questions and further clarify the mechanisms by which curcumin exerts its effects.    Conclusion  This study highlights the significant role of intestinal mucosal barrier damage and systemic inflammatory response in PCOS pathophysiology, particularly implicating the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Curcumin emerges as a promising therapeutic intervention, demonstrating the ability to mitigate ovarian tissue damage, restore intestinal mucosal integrity, reduce mucosal permeability, and alleviate systemic and ovarian inflammation by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These findings support curcumin\u2019s potential as a promising intervention for the prevention and treatment of PCOS.
