    "body": "Introduction  The International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management\nof polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) , published in July 2018, brings\ntogether a wide collaboration of international societies, consumer organisations,\nand women directly affected by PCOS. 1 Borne out of the need for rigorous evidence-based processes that can\ntranslate into high-quality patient care; the guideline\u2019s mission was to prioritise\nclinical questions and promote consistent evidence-based care, improving the quality\nof life for women with PCOS. The guideline itself provides a combination of 166\nrecommendations and clinical practice points, broadly categorised into 5 sections,\nwhich focus on diagnosis, holistic management and safe, effective fertility\ntreatment. The question remains as to whether this guideline will now be fully\nadopted into specialist management of this complex condition which often spans many\nmedical specialties at once. This article will address each of the 5 categories,\nevaluating each recommendation that may orchestrate change in our current clinical\npractice.    Screening, Diagnostic Assessment, Risk Assessment, and Life Stage   Irregular cycle and ovulatory dysfunction  Ovulatory dysfunction with irregular menstrual cycles is a major component of\nPCOS. Menstrual irregularity is common through adolescence and is recognised as\na sign of pubertal transition, with maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary\naxis. The difficulties of defining normal age-related change from that of PCOS\nin these years are difficult. Historically, young women have felt a lack of\neducation and dissatisfaction in time taken to diagnosis, delaying targeted\ntherapies. The global guideline makes clear recommendations based on\ngynaecological age, regarding when cycles should be termed irregular\npost-menarche. With more defined criteria, this should help the conundrum of\nadolescent diagnosis providing aid in all clinical settings dealing with young\nwomen.    Biochemical hyperandrogenism  Accurate assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism has been handicapped by\nandrogen selection, assay method and confounding factors of age, body mass index\n(BMI), and ethnicity. Where available the considered optimum assay method is to\nuse liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS)/mass spectrometry and\nextraction/chromatography immunoassays to test for total or free testosterone.\nIdeally samples should be taken in the morning of early follicular phase to\nlimit cycle variation. Additional testing for androstenedione and DHEAS is\nunlikely to yield more in the diagnosis of PCOS. The guideline provides clarity\non androgen testing but is likely to be current practice in most places and\ntherefore not alter clinical practice.    Clinical hyperandrogenism  The assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism is highly subjective and often masked\nby patient self-management of conditions such as hirsutism. The modified\nFerriman-Gallwey score is a simple and reproducible way of grading hirsutism of\nwhich a score >4-6 defines significant hirsutism. There are also big ethnic\nvariations in the expression of hyperandrogenism. 2 More than 50% of women with a score of 3-5 will have elevated androgens. 3 There are no reliable measures for acne. The important point raised by\nthe guideline is that irrespective of clinician grading of clinical\nhyperandrogenism, it is the patient\u2019s experience and reporting of the condition\nthat is key. These symptoms are entwined with many of the categories discussed\nin this guideline including body image, self-esteem, and psychological impact of\nPCOS. Clinicians should remain respectful of the reported symptoms and try to\nincorporate this into their management planning.    Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology  Since the original Rotterdam criteria definition of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), 4 there have been many challenges to the optimum diagnostic features\ninvolving follicle number and volume. 5 With advanced technology, many have called for the criteria to keep pace;\nwith critics of ultrasound suggesting that over reliance on ultrasound has led\nto over-diagnosis. This is most clear in the adolescent population for whom many\nwill have a \u2018PCOM\u2019 ovary. The global guideline suggests after conducting a\nsystematic review that when using transvaginal ultrasound transducers, with a\nfrequency bandwidth that includes 8\u2009MHz, a follicle number per ovary of \u2a7e20\nshould be used for PCOM. When older technology or a transabdominal approach, an\novarian volume of >10\u2009mL is preferred. Focussed training should occur for\nthose regularly conducting these investigations to ensure reliability and\nreproducibility. Ultrasound should not be used for diagnosis in the adolescent\nyears or more specifically within the 8\u2009years after menarche. If adopted, this\nstrategy is likely to alter clinical practice significantly. Many ultrasound\nreports do not quantify PCOM accurately and change in recommendations will take\ntime to disseminate and action. The tightening of diagnostic criteria should\nreduce worry for patients, who often feel labelled by incidental findings on\ninvestigations that are unlikely to yield clinical effect.    Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone  Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) correlates with features of PCOS, mainly PCOM. 6 The test has been plagued with assay instability leading many to question\nits validity as a test. Although much literature exists to support its use in\nPCOS and offer an alternative to ultrasound morphology and other serum testing,\nthis guideline believes that it should not yet be used in the diagnosis of\nPCOS.    Ethnic variation  The manifestations of PCOS across ethnicity are diverse and varied. Metabolic\nfeatures predominate in South Asian and indigenous Australians. Hirsutism is\nmore significant in Hispanic and Middle Eastern populations. Increased BMI and\nmetabolic features are more common in those of African descent. The guideline\nfeatures the relevant effect of ethnicity under the individual categories and\nshould influence clinical practice localised to the demographics in which people\npractice.    Menopause life stage  The phenotypic presentation of PCOS with age alters, with a precise definition\nyet to be defined for that post-menopause. Symptoms of oligo-anovulation often\nabate but androgenic symptoms may persist. Use of age-related reference ranges\nfor diagnostic features are recommended; with the diagnosis of PCOS in an older\npopulation having potential to focus screening on factors which present with age\nsuch as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and cancer. It is important to\nremember that rapid onset of androgenic symptoms should always be evaluated for\nandrogen-secreting tumours.    Cardiovascular disease  The collective increase in risk factors for CVD with PCOS, warrant screening for\nknown additional risk factors including sedentary lifestyle, smoking,\ndyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance. Although the actual\nCVD risk remains unclear in PCOS, highlighting these factors reminds clinicians\nto think broadly regarding long-term health and not just their individual topic\nsuch as fertility. These guidelines appear to be directed at primary care who\ncarry out the majority of screening and should remind all to acknowledge PCOS\nwithin a risk assessment.    Gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes  There is no doubt that the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM), impaired glucose\ntolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes is increased in PCOS and exacerbated by obesity. 7 Ethnicity has a huge influence on outcome, with many in a high-risk south\nAsian population developing diabetes by their early 40s unlike a Caucasian\nEuropean cohort. 8 Previous prescriptive guidelines have had limited uptake on when and how\nto screen women with PCOS. This is compounded by the controversies surrounding\nwhich screening tool to adopt, cost implications, and patient convenience. The\ncurrent guidelines have underdone rigorous review and are for the first time\nbased on absolute risk of diabetes in PCOS. Use of the oral glucose tolerance\ntest (OGTT), fasting glucose, or HbA1C all have their individual merits, with\nthe OGTT outperforming the other two options. The guideline recommends that all\nwomen with PCOS be screened at least at initial consultation and on a minimum\n3-year interval thereafter with the simple tests of hypergycaemia of HbA1C or\nfasting glucose. For women deemed \u2018high-risk\u2019 which includes those with a BMI\n>25\u2009kg/m 2 or >23 in the Asian population, an OGTT is\nrecommended. Furthermore, there is clear recommendation to perform a\npre-conception OGTT and also repeat it at 28\u2009weeks of gestation. These\nrecommendations will have significant impact on service provision. All groups\ninvolved in the production of this guideline fully endorsed the proposed\nscreening methods, acknowledging the feasibility, acceptability, and financial\nimplication posed to current practice. Many obstetric units will only plan an\nOGTT for those with multiple risk factors and not purely PCOS alone. Despite the\nchallenge in implementation, there should be no diversion from implementing\nevidence into practice.    Obstructive sleep apnoea  Obstructive sleep apnoea has been connected with PCOS and its metabolic\ncomponent, not purely caused by obesity. Limited quality of evidence to suggest\ntreatment improves metabolic outcomes does not warrant screening for all. For\nthose women who are symptomatic for snoring and daytime somnolence, screening\nand onward referral may be beneficial to improve the psychological coping\nstrategies for the condition.    Endometrial cancer  Women with PCOS have a 2- to 6-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer before menopause. 9 The increased risk stems from unopposed oestrogen from anovulatory cycles\nstimulating the endometrium. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic\nsyndrome are also associated with increased risk. The pragmatic recommendation\nto stay vigilant for the condition and consider investigation where symptoms\nsuggest concern, cements common practice among gynaecologists. Furthermore, the\npragmatic approach to protect the endometrium in amenorrhoeic women may involve\neither the use of the combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP),\nprogestin-induced withdrawal bleeds at least once every 3\u2009months, or a\nprogestagen-releasing intrauterine system.     Prevalence, Screening, Diagnostic Assessment, and Treatment of Emotional\nWellbeing   Quality of life  Those with PCOS have a lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than their\npeers. Studies using non-specific QoL tools to quantify effects have repeatedly\nshown the impact of PCOS through reduced scores compared with non-PCOS matched women. 10 Criticism of these generic tools is the lack of relevance for some\naspects questioned including pain scores and mobility. Specific tools addressing\nkey concerns including hirsutism, fertility, and menstrual disturbance now exist\nin the form of the polycystic ovary syndrome questionnaire (PCOSQ) and modified\npolycystic ovary syndrome questionnaire (MPCOSQ). 11 These highlight key domains that patients consider important including\nhirsutism, infertility, and menstrual problems. It is recognised that there are\ndifferences across life stage, ethnicity, and culture. 12 The importance of recognising the impact of symptoms on the individual\npatient is crucial for developing both close rapport and supportive long-term\ncare. Adoption of these tools, which may be unfamiliar to many, into mainstream\nclinical care is likely to be a major change in clinical practice. Consideration\nof use at particular key stages of care for women including initial consultation\nand changing life stages could provide reliable feedback on patient outcomes and\nhelp guide further management to improve their overall care.    Depressive and anxiety symptoms, screening, and treatment  The recognition of the psychological impact of PCOS remains limited worldwide.\nDepressive symptoms appear to be doubled in the PCOS population compared with\nweight matched controls (36.6% in PCOS vs 14.2% in controls). 13 Similarly, anxiety scores are higher in women with PCOS. The cause for\nthese symptoms is multifactorial, with the complex interplay of symptoms and\neffects contributing to this chronic condition. The global guideline takes an\neducated view that it is the responsibility of all health care professionals\nengaging with this population to screen for and action management for those\ndisplaying symptoms. Simple strategies are suggested to guide questioning on\nsymptoms to help broaden the clinician\u2019s approach. The entry of such guidance\ninto mainstream recommendation should aid a significant change in clinical\npractice, improving patient satisfaction in their care.    Psychosexual function  There is a perceived reduction in psychosexual function in women with PCOS. The\ninterlinked feelings of femininity, sexuality, and body image contribute to a\nhighly emotive subject for which there are recognised tools to assess a woman\u2019s\nindividual psychosexual function. The guideline addresses the challenges that\nthe health professional faces in attempting to address this subject with\nemphasis on cultural acceptability. In doing so there is a considerable shift in\nfavour of taking a holistic outlook on managing women with PCOS that will\nchallenge current clinical practice.    Body image  It is unsurprising that many women with PCOS have lower satisfaction with their\nbody image and lower self-esteem, given the symptoms related to the condition.\nHirsutism, excess weight, and acne are all interlinked with the populist view of\nbody image and are independently related to feelings of self-worth, mental\nhealth, and QoL. Although no form of reliable screening is available, the\nguideline suggests that health professionals should be aware of the impact on\nbody image and attempt to tailor care to the individual in question.    Eating disorders and disordered eating  Disordered eating and formal eating disorder diagnoses are more common in PCOS.\nThe ability to screen for such conditions may not be routine in many clinicians\u2019\npractice. The use of the SCOFF screening tool can provide guidance for practice.\nThe awareness of the problem by clinician\u2019s and the broaching of concern with\nindividuals about their eating practice can help guide women into psychological\nhelp where needed, which in turn will have a sequential effect on all the\nparameters mentioned in this category. While this is unlikely to effect a huge\nchange in clinical practice, raising awareness will foster the holistic practice\nof medicine directed at PCOS.    Information resources, models of care, cultural, and linguistic\nconsiderations  Throughout their life, patients with PCOS will access care from many varying\nspecialities with often little collaboration between them. Reported\ndissatisfaction with information and method of information provision is high. 14 Placing this into context, there is a strong connection between PCOS and\ndifferent ethnic groups for whom English is not the first language; yet English\nis the predominant language in which information is provided. Provision of\nsupport by other than written methods is recognised to be beneficial.\nHighlighting the deficiencies in our current clinical practice, this guideline\nshould alert many to methods to engage patients in their treatment which should\nultimately lead to improved health parameters. Accepting that longer\nconsultations, involvement of family members, and the use of non-written\ninformation for low literacy patients are likely to reform some common clinical\npractices. Furthermore, the global reach of this guideline requires it \u2013 and\nassociated patient information resources \u2013 to be translated into as many\nlanguages as possible.     Lifestyle   Effectiveness of lifestyle interventions  Globally, women report that excess weight contributes to significant distress in\nPCOS; yet they feel that information surrounding healthy lifestyle is inadequate. 15 Evidence suggests that lifestyle intervention including weight\nmanagement, behaviour, and exercise all contribute to improve aspects of PCOS. 16 Realistic goal setting in partnership with the patient yields the best\nlong-term outcome. Detailed recommendations from the guideline are likely to go\nbeyond current clinical practice for many, stressing the importance of providing\ntime and resource to enable these women to help themselves. The time and\nfinancial implication of this sort of holistic care does need addressing.    Behavioural interventions  Behavioural interventions in conjunction with diet and exercise have been shown\nto achieve better results than diet or exercise alone. 17 The strategies adopted include problem solving, goal setting, and relapse\nprevention, leading to a more sustained outcome. Emphasis on self-management\nwith support of friends and family is reinforced in this guideline. Providing\naccess to this sort of intervention is likely to be one of the hardest points to\nachieve from the global guideline. Brief consultation times and skill base\navailable to provide this level of care may limit implementation, but our\ncurrent generation of health professionals is increasingly better trained in\nthese areas. Patient skills in behaviour change are fundamental to enable\nself-management of chronic disease in the modern era of clinical care.    Dietary interventions  There is no clear evidence to support one dietary intervention over another for\nthose with PCOS. Studies looking at general overweight populations confirm no\nadvantage of different diet plans. 18 Individualised approaches taking into account culture and dietary\npreferences that reduce energy intake by 500-750\u2009kcal/day are advocated by this\nguideline. It provides pragmatic advice that should already be current practice,\nfor well-informed practitioners.    Exercise interventions  For those with PCOS, as for any population, there is clear benefit from regular\nsustained exercise on metabolic, reproductive, and psychological health.\nEvidence suggests that those with PCOS lead a more sedentary lifestyle. 19 Clear prescriptive recommendations are laid out in the global guideline\nstipulating amount and type of exercise that concurs with the UK\u2019s national\nrecommendations. The goal to achieve 150\u2009min/week of moderate- to high-intensity\nexercise (more for adolescents) has been in place for a long time prior to\nconfirmation in this guideline. This message should be broadcast widely, to\nprevent women feeling that little advice is given to help them. There should be\nno barriers to patients as exercise intervention does not need to be costly.\nThis recommendation should not be new information but rather verification of\ncurrent practice.    Obesity and weight assessment  Longitudinal studies confirm that for those with PCOS, weight gain is more rapid\nand exceeds that of non-PCOS counterparts. 20 Obesity as outlined in much of this paper is causative or connective to\nmany of the issues surrounding PCOS. Respectful and adequate discussion needs to\ntake place as to why weight is an issue and how best to address excess weight.\nPhysical monitoring of weight, although useful, may be difficult in time\nconstrained service provision but advice to do so takes limited time. This is\nlikely to be a more difficult aspect for negotiating into current practice but\nnonetheless is strongly recommended for all patients not just those with PCOS.\nPromotion of healthy lifestyle and weight gain prevention is fundamental in\nproviding good clinical care for this population.     Pharmacological Treatment for Non-Fertility Indications   Combined oral contraceptive pills  Much literature of varying quality exists for the use of the COCP in both the\nadult and adolescent population. For both populations, there is a clear\nrecommendation to consider the COCP for management of hyperandrogenism and\nirregular menstrual cycles, including for those adolescents who are deemed \u2018at\nrisk\u2019 but have yet to be given a defined diagnosis of PCOS. There is not enough\nevidence to stratify the \u2018best\u2019 COCP to use despite a common approach to use the\nlowest effective oestrogen dosage. It has been made clear to limit dependence on\n35\u2009\u03bcg ethinyloestradiol plus cyproterone acetate due to an increased risk of\nthromboembolic events, and therefore, these agents should not be viewed as the\nfirst-line COCP of choice. Consideration to the addition of metformin to the\nfirst-line use of the COCP is suggested for those who do not achieve their goals\non COCP and lifestyle changes alone. Those who have metabolic features are\noverweight and from high-risk ethnic groups may do best from the combined\napproach. The overriding instruction is to include the woman in the best choice\nof medication for her individual case which may involve a combination of\ntherapies, for which she needs to be aware of the risks and benefits. The\n\u2018cocktail\u2019 approach of treatment may yield significant change in practice for\nclinicians used to maintaining monotherapy prescribing.    Metformin  Despite the wealth of literature on metformin use in PCOS, there remains some\nuncertainty of the exact merits of metformin in treating biochemical and\nphysical manifestations of the condition. On balance, the mild side effect\nprofile is counterbalanced by an improvement in metabolic features and BMI,\nparticularly in the overweight and high-risk groups. If so desired, metformin\ncan be offered to women on this basis. With the changing tide of thought on\nmetformin in constant flux, many people may still regularly prescribe this\nmedication and is likely to reflect the majority of clinical practice. As long\nas women are fully counselled on its effects, this low-cost treatment looks here\nto stay.    Anti-obesity pharmacological agents  There is minimal evidence for the use of pharmacological anti-obesity agents in\nreproductive aged woman. Evidence in other obese populations suggests that there\nmay be a role 21 for medical therapy alongside effective lifestyle and exercise\nintervention. These agents should not be taken by those wishing to conceive.    Anti-androgen pharmacological agents  Anti-androgens such as flutamide, finasteride, and spironolactone have been\nsuggested as a treatment for clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS. A paucity of\nevidence looking at these agents alone or in comparison with the COCP\n(traditional first-line treatment) leaves their true efficacy unclear. The\nguideline acknowledges the potential for use in those who do not tolerate the\nCOCP, although reliable contraception is also required because of concerns about\nteratogenicity.    Inositol  Inositol is a nutritional supplement that has a role in insulin signal\ntransduction. Limited evidence is available regarding its role in modifying\nmetabolic and biochemical components of PCOS. Recent data 22 suggest that menstrual cyclicity and ovulation may be improved. While the\nguideline suggests caution in use due to limited benefit, there is only a low\nside effect profile and low cost related to this treatment.     Assessment and Treatment of Infertility   Assessment of factors that may affect fertility, treatment response, and\npregnancy outcomes  It is widely accepted that optimised health parameters before pregnancy lead to\nimproved pregnancy outcomes, with no exception for those with PCOS 23 Obesity (particularly central adiposity) is perhaps the most important\nmodifiable factor that impacts on fertility and successful pregnancy in those\nwith PCOS. The onward trajectory in pregnancy is hampered for those with PCOS\nwith an increase in GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and prematurity. 24 This highlights once again the need for optimisation of detrimental\nmodifiable risk factors recommended in the global guideline. These\nrecommendations are unlikely to stray far from or alter current practice,\nparticularly in health care settings such as the United Kingdom where provision\nof fertility services is curtailed by extremes of weight. Furthermore, it could\nbe suggested that clinics not addressing weight management before active\nfertility treatment are negligent in maintaining safe patient care.  There is often debate on the optimum time to assess tubal function in couples\nwith ovulatory dysfunction alone. While the risks of tubal patency checking,\nwith less invasive procedures such as hysterosalpingography or more recently\nhysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography are minimal, the risk of false-positive\nresults is present. The broad suggestion to discuss optimum timing of testing\nwith the low-risk woman will allow the individual clinic to maintain its status\nquo and current testing regimen and therefore alter little in clinical\npractice.    Ovulation induction  The aromatase inhibitor (AI), letrozole, is the recommended first-line treatment\nfor those with PCOS requiring ovulation induction (OI). The pharmacological\naction of letrozole prevents the conversion of androgens to oestrogens with\nsubsequent ovarian-pituitary feedback initiating the release of follicle\nstimulating hormone (FSH). A blemished reputation from an unpublished abstract 25 led to more than a decade of research attempting to refute or\nsubstantiate evidence of an increased congenital abnormality rate in infants\nborn through letrozole use. Multiple studies 26 and a recent meta-analysis 27 suggest no statistical increase in any abnormalities. The former group 26 compared natural cycle vs letrozole-induced cycles suggesting no\ndifference in risk (natural cycle 1.5% vs letrozole 1.9%, aOR, 1.24, 95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.40, P =\u2009.52).  With the safety of the AI seemingly confirmed, that its pharmacological\neffectiveness has been compared with Clomiphene Citrate (CC) is also important.\nA recent cochrane review 28 clearly sides in favour of letrozole, with an improved live birth rate\n(odds ratio (OR) 1.68, 95% CI 1.42-1.99; 2954 participants; 13 studies) and a\nsmall number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (=10). A\nmarginal reduction in multiple pregnancy rate and reduced side effect profile\nfurther support its use as the first-line agent of choice. This shift in favour\nof the AI is likely to present a substantial change in clinical practice for\nmany clinicians, but in using the evidence-based medicine approach, it should be\none that is adopted to improve patient care. In many countries, the use of\nletrazole remains off label. Professionals need to inform women of this fact\nwhere appropriate; discussing the evidence, possible concerns and side effect\nprofile when using the drug.  Although an AI is preferable, the ability to use CC is still an acceptable\nalternative within this guideline. Interestingly, once again metformin is\noffered as an alternative treatment, despite the inferior pregnancy outcome to\nother agents. The justification being as long as counselling takes place of more\neffective agents being available, metformin requires little monitoring, has\nlimited risk attributed to it, plus holds a relatively mild and transient\ngastrointestinal side effect profile. In fact, the combination of CC with\nmetformin for CC-resistant case is supported, particularly in the slimmer\nindividual, by a recent Cochrane review. 29 This is likely to reignite older practices, with respect to the use of\nmetformin in the primary care setting, as patients explore alternatives to\ncostly fertility treatments    Gonadotrophins  Gonadotrophins remain a second-line alternative to oral OI in specialist centres\nwho have the ability and capacity to provide adequate monitoring of treatment\nwith ultrasound. For those who are clomiphene resistant or exhibit the side\neffects of anti-oestrogen medication such as endometrial thinning,\ngonadotrophins provide a good chance of success. There remains no compelling\nevidence to use one preparation of gonadotrophin over another in OI. 30    Laparoscopic ovarian surgery  Laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) remains an option, particularly for women with\nPCOS who undergo laparoscopy for other reasons. There appears little difference\nin clinical outcome between LOS and other OI methods. 31 The guideline serves to remind surgeons that full discussion of potential\nrisks of surgery is important if considering this treatment including the\npotential long-term effect on ovarian function.    Bariatric surgery and anti-obesity agents  The ever-increasing waist circumference of the global population has led to\nsignificant developments in methods to tackle obesity other than through\nlifestyle intervention. It is no surprise that the guideline now covers\nbariatric surgery and anti-obesity pharmacology with respect to fertility\ntreatment. With no evidence for either in PCOS and fertility, both options\nshould remain experimental. For women who do undergo surgery, serious\nconsideration must be given to delay to conception until nutritional stability\nhas been achieved after weight reduction as there are potential risks to the\nneonate through growth restriction and neonatal mortality. 32    In vitro fertilisation  The option to consider in vitro fertilisation (IVF) should only be considered\nthird-line therapy in those with isolated PCOS. The GnRH antagonist cycle is now\nwidely recognised as superior to the agonist cycle in reducing the risk of\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in women with polycystic ovaries. 33 With equivalent pregnancy rates, the adoption of this strategy in at\nleast the initial cycle of IVF appears unquestionable. For the remaining clinics\nwho continue to favour the agonist approach, this guideline provides a further\npersuasive argument to modify clinical practice. The option to consider the GnRH\nagonist trigger to further eliminate OHSS is advisable. As in the general\npopulation, there remains no firm evidence to favour one type of gonadotrophin\nover another. 34 In those who have to use a GnRH agonists for pituitary desensitisation,\nmetformin as an adjunct also reduces the risk of OHSS. In vitro maturation (IVM)\nhas been studied over the years as a way to eradicate OHSS. For the few clinics\nwho have a made a success of this technique, there is no reason to ignore its\nmerit but it is unlikely to become a mainstream alternative to standard IVF.     Conclusions  The global guideline has provided a well-rounded and all-inclusive synopsis of all\naspects of PCOS. Recommendations made are clear and should help eliminate or reduce\nareas of conflict such as adolescent diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and optimum\nfertility treatments. The addition of large sections addressing lifestyle and\nemotional well-being strengthen the importance of looking at the patient as a whole\nrather than a collection of individual symptoms and problems to solve. Furthermore,\nthe guideline group has produced a number of resources for health care professionals\n( https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos/resources ) and also\nfor patients so that they themselves may be empowered to better understand and\nmanage their condition and take control of their own health and well-being. For the\nwell-informed clinician who regularly consults with these patients, the guideline is\nunlikely to change much clinical practice. For those who see women with PCOS\ninfrequently, this guideline provides an excellent opportunity to appraise the\nliterature for themselves and practice evidence-based medicine well.",
