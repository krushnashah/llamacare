    "abstract": "What is the natural history of reproductive, psychological and oncological features in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison to those without PCOS across the life course? Existing longitudinal data on changes in reproductive, psychological and oncological features in PCOS are inadequate and conflicting, but the limited evidence suggests that total testosterone (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels decline more significantly in women with PCOS than in those without PCOS, and the risk of gestational diabetes is higher in pregnant women with PCOS compared to their counterparts without PCOS. The progression of reproductive, psychological and oncological features in PCOS remains unclear, which limits prevention and early diagnosis strategies across the lifespan. Understanding the natural history of PCOS is one of the overarching priorities in PCOS research. This is a systematic review of longitudinal cohort studies with a narrative presentation of findings. Databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid PsycInfo, CINAHL PLUS and EBM reviews were searched between 15 January 2020 and 11 February 2021 with no language restrictions. Only studies published from the year 1990 to February 2021 were included. In line with current guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS, we included studies where participants were females with PCOS diagnosed according to the 2003 Rotterdam or the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria. A total of 21 longitudinal studies including 62\u00a0123 participants over four continents reported reproductive, psychological and/or oncological outcomes. Participants were females aged between 15 and 49\u2009years at baseline, with follow-up periods ranging from 4\u2009weeks to 32\u2009years. Consistent evidence based on limited studies suggests that total T and DHEAS levels decline to a greater degree in women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS, and the risk gestational diabetes is higher in women with PCOS than in those without PCOS. Evidence reporting changes over time in the majority of the remaining outcomes was unclear due to conflicting and/or insufficient information. There was extreme heterogeneity between studies in terms of study setting, population characteristics, follow-up period, effect measures used and laboratory testing approaches. Understanding the natural history of PCOS and changes in diagnostic, reproductive, psychological and oncological features of PCOS across the lifespan is still a challenge and the existing literature is both limited and conflicting. It is important that future long-term prospective longitudinal studies are conducted in unselected and well-characterized populations. This specific study was not funded.

    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-metabolic disorder diagnosed in adults based on the presence of at least two of three clinical features, including polycystic ovary morphology, oligo/amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical). PCOS is a major public health issue that affects 5\u201315% women of reproductive age globally ( Azziz et al. , 2006 ; Diamanti-Kandarakis et al. , 2006 ; March et al. , 2010 ; Bozdag et al. , 2016 ) but is complicated by diagnostic challenges including a lack of clear definitions for individual PCOS features. These contribute to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and patient dissatisfaction ( Dokras et al. , 2017 ; Gibson-Helm et al. , 2017 ), and up to 70% of women with the condition remain undiagnosed ( March et al. , 2010 ). The lack of information on changes in biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism, cycle regularity and ovarian morphology, including the PCOS phenotype over the lifespan, also complicates diagnosis and warrants further investigation.  Women with PCOS are at increased risk of adverse reproductive, metabolic and psychological outcomes. Common reproductive features of the condition include biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory and menstrual dysfunction, hirsutism, subfertility, endometrial hyperplasia and obstetrical complications ( Teede et al. , 2018a,b ). Women with PCOS are also at a higher risk of infertility or reduced fertility than those without PCOS, which may be driven by changes in oocyte, endometrial and embryo function ( Palomba, 2021 ). Metabolic features include increased risks for insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( Legro et al. , 1999 ; Apridonidze et al. , 2005 ). Psychological features include anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and poor body image ( Moran et al. , 2010 ; Teede et al. , 2010 ; Deeks et al. , 2011 ). Increased endometrial cancer risk has also been associated with PCOS ( Charalampakis et al. , 2016 ). These diverse PCOS features lead to a diminished quality of life in affected women ( Dokras et al. , 2018 ; Teede et al. , 2018a,b ). Overall, PCOS is associated with a substantial economic burden, conservatively estimated to exceed an annual total cost of $8 billion USD in the USA alone (2020 USD), including healthcare costs related to diagnosis, reproductive, metabolic, vascular and pregnancy-related morbidities ( Riestenberg et al. , 2022 ).  The recent international evidence-based guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of PCOS ( Teede et al. , 2018b ) highlighted our limited understanding of the natural history of reproductive, psychological and oncological outcomes in PCOS and identified major gaps that currently limit the development of effective prevention strategies across the lifespan. Furthermore, understanding the natural history of PCOS emerged from the guideline process as one of the overarching priorities in PCOS research. Therefore, we now aim to explore the natural history of PCOS with a focus on reproductive and psychologic features as well as cancer risk, by conducting a systematic review of longitudinal cohort studies.    Materials and methods   Protocol  This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines ( Moher et al. , 2010 ; Page et al. , 2021 ) and was registered (CRD42020165546) in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO).    Literature search   Search strategy  A comprehensive systematic search based on the selection criteria combining MeSH terms and text words was developed using the OVID platform and translated to the CINAHL database as appropriate ( Supplementary Data File S1 ). The search terms used were based on the harmonized core outcomes set for PCOS ( Al Wattar et al. , 2020 ) and the search was limited to human studies published from the year 1990 to 11 February 2021. The 1990 limit reflects the establishment of the first modern definition for PCOS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1990 criteria ( Zawadski and Dunaif, 1992 ). Studies were included regardless of the publication language.    Databases  Various electronic databases were first searched on 15 January 2020 and the search was updated on 11 February 2021. Specifically, these databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to 07 January 2020, EMBASE Classic+Embase (1947 to 07 January 2020), PsycINFO (1806 to December Week 5 2019) and CINAHL PLUS via the EBSCO host Interface, as well as all EBM Reviews.     Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The Participant, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study type (PICOS) framework ( Supplementary Table SI ) was used in selection of articles included in this review. Participants were females of any age group and any weight with a PCOS diagnosis according to the 2003 Rotterdam or the 1990 NIH consensus criteria, to align with current international evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS ( Teede et al. , 2018b ). Females without PCOS (any age group and weight) were considered as the comparison group. Both retrospective and prospective longitudinal cohort studies were included. Studies were excluded if the participants\u2019 PCOS diagnostic criteria were not NIH or Rotterdam 2003, or were unclear such as use of ICD codes alone.  In terms of intervention/exposure, this review included studies that followed women with a PCOS diagnosis and reported longitudinal findings that demonstrated changes or predicted risk for specific PCOS features or outcomes over time (without treatment, to reflect the natural history of the condition). Follow-up studies with or without a comparison group of women without PCOS were also included. Main reproductive, metabolic, psychological and oncological-related outcomes were categorized in accordance with the PCOS core outcomes set ( Al Wattar et al. , 2020 ).  The reproductive category included measures of clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, as measured by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score, testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), androstenedione (A 4 ) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS). We also assessed the reproductive hormone profile, including LH, FSH, LH:FSH ratio and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH). This was in addition to ovulatory function, such as menstrual regularity and chronic anovulation, as well as pregnancy viability and outcomes, including gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disease in pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, live birth, preterm birth, birth weight, major congenital abnormalities and neonatal mortality. Also assessed were psychological outcomes, including depression, anxiety and eating disorders, and oncological-related outcomes, including atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.    Study selection and risk of bias assessment  Screening of articles on abstracts and full text was carried out by two independent reviewers (S.K. and C.T.T. or K.L.R.) to identify eligible studies. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or by a third reviewer (K.L.R. or C.T.T.). Methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies were assessed by two independent reviewers (S.K. and K.L.R.) using criteria established according to the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI) Evidence Synthesis Program critical appraisal tool ( Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, 2003 ). The MCHRI critical appraisal tool is based on the Newcastle\u2010Ottawa Scale (NOS) for non\u2010randomized studies ( Wells et al. , 2014 ). Studies were assessed on individual criteria related to external validity (methodology, inclusion/exclusion criteria and appropriateness of measured outcomes) and internal validity (attrition, detection, selection and reporting bias, confounding, statistical analyses and study power). Studies that fulfilled all, most or few criteria were deemed to have low, moderate and high levels of bias, respectively. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using Covidence software ( Babineau, 2014 ) and disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach a consensus.    Data extraction and synthesis  Data for each outcome were extracted manually using a researcher pre-designed data extraction form in Microsoft Excel. Data were extracted by two reviewers (S.K. and K.L.R.). Information was collected on general details (authors, reference/source, country, year of publication, setting), participants (age, ethnicity, selection criteria, comparison/subgroups, number of participants, duration of follow-up, PCOS criteria), results (point estimates and measures of variability/effect) and any other key PCOS outcome results related to natural history. A narrative description of results is presented according to each outcome category.     Results   Search results  A total of 9497 studies were identified from the search ( Fig.\u00a01 ). After exclusion of duplicates (about 10% of studies identified), 8205 and 255 studies were assessed on abstract and full text, respectively. There were 216 studies excluded at full-text review stage due to various reasons, such as unclear criteria or self-reported PCOS status, ineligible outcomes or cross-sectional design, as shown in Supplementary Table SII . Therefore, 39 studies met our inclusion criteria and 21 of them reported reproductive, psychologic and/or oncological-related outcomes. The remaining eight studies reported metabolic outcomes only and have been presented in a separate manuscript ( Kiconco et al. , 2022 ).   Figure 1.    Flow chart of study selection. *Reasons for exclusion are in Supplementary Table SII .       Characteristics of included studies  Characteristics of the included studies are outlined in Table\u00a0I . Six of the studies ( Kerchner et al. , 2009 ; Huddleston et al. , 2017 ; Ahmad et al. , 2018 ; Greenwood et al. , 2019a,b ; Jarrett et al. , 2020 ) were conducted in the USA, four studies were conducted in Italy ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Carmina et al. , 2012a,b ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ), three studies ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a , b ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) were conducted in Sweden, and two were from Denmark ( Altinok et al. , 2014 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ). The remaining six studies were conducted in Hong Kong ( Ng et al. , 2019 ), the Netherlands ( Brown et al. , 2011 ), Mexico ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ), Venezuela ( Jakubowicz et al. , 2002 ) and Taiwan ( Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ; Harnod et al. , 2020 ).

The baseline age of participants ranged from 21 to 37\u2009years for 18 of the studies, while the baseline age in three studies ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a , b ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) was 49\u2009years. The mean follow-up duration ranged from 4\u2009weeks to 32\u2009years (study-combined average of 4 to 16\u2009years per parameter) for non-pregnancy-related outcomes ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and from 24 to 27 gestational weeks for pregnancy-associated outcomes. Only one study obtained participants from a nationally linked database ( Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ), while the rest of the studies were practice-based (general hospital or academic). Four studies ( Jakubowicz et al. , 2002 ; Kerchner et al. , 2009 ; Carmina et al. , 2012a ; Greenwood et al. , 2019a ) were uncontrolled or the control participants were not followed up. The assigned overall risk of bias was low for 5 of the 21 (23.8%) studies ( Palomba et al. , 2014 ; Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ; Ng et al. , 2019 ; Greenwood et al. , 2019b ) and the rest demonstrated moderate (n\u2009=\u20099) or high (n\u2009=\u20097) risk ( Table\u00a0I ).  Thirteen studies ( Jakubowicz et al. , 2002 ; Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Carmina et al. , 2012a , b ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ; Huddleston et al. , 2017 ; Ahmad et al. , 2018 ; Ng et al. , 2019 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ; Jarrett et al. , 2020 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) reported data on reproductive outcomes (hormonal profiles, clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism and menstrual cycle regularity). Three studies ( Jakubowicz et al. , 2002 ; Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ) reported pregnancy-related outcomes, five reported on psychological outcomes ( Kerchner et al. , 2009 ; Altinok et al. , 2014 ; Greenwood et al. , 2019a , b ; Harnod et al. , 2020 ) and two reported oncological-related outcomes ( Schmidt et al. , 2011b ; Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ).

Diagnostic features and reproductive outcomes  Changes over time in all reproductive outcomes including clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, reproductive hormonal profiles and menstrual regularity are shown in Table\u00a0II .   Clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism   Hirsutism, acne and alopecia  Women with PCOS had significantly higher mFG scores than those without PCOS at 18 and 25\u2009months of follow-up ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ). However, the mFG score as a measure of hirsutism did not appear to change over time in women with or without PCOS, as indicated by two studies ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ). None of the eligible studies reported longitudinal findings regarding acne or alopecia.    Testosterone  Ten studies reported data regarding changes in total T and three of these ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) compared the total changes in T between women with and without PCOS. Two of the three studies ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ) indicated a significantly larger decline in total T over time among women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS, while one study showed ( Forslund et al. , 2021 ) no significant difference in total T decline over time between the two groups. Of the seven studies that reported total T change from baseline within the PCOS group, five studies ( Carmina et al. , 2012a , b ; Huddleston et al. , 2017 ; Ng et al. , 2019 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ) demonstrated significant declines, while one study ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ) showed a non-significant increase. Another study among pregnant women with PCOS observed a significant increase in total T during gestation ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ). Among women without PCOS, three studies indicated significant declines in T ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ), while three studies did not observe a significant change ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Carmina et al. , 2012a , b ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ) in total T from baseline.    Free T and FAI   Udesen et al. (2019) observed significant declines in free T among women with PCOS, but not in those without PCOS. No other study assessed free T levels. Schmidt et al. (2011a ) observed a significantly larger decline in FAI levels in women with PCOS than in women without PCOS over time, while the decline was not significantly different between the two groups in another study ( Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Among studies that reported FAI changes in comparison with baseline within women with PCOS, two ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Brown et al. , 2011 ) did not observe a significant change, while three studies in non-pregnant women ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Ng et al. , 2019 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) did observe a change. One study in pregnant women ( Palomba et al. , 2014 ) observed significant FAI declines. Among women without PCOS, two studies in non-pregnant women ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) and one study in pregnant women ( Palomba et al. , 2014 ) indicated significant declines in FAI, although one study ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ) did not observe a significant decline in FAI.    Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate  All three studies that compared changes in DHEAS demonstrated significantly larger DHEAS declines among women with PCOS than women without ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Among women with PCOS, seven of the eight studies that compared DHEAS changes from baseline reported significant declines ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Carmina et al. , 2012a , b ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ), but one study showed a non-significant decline ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ). In women without PCOS, two studies indicated significant DHEAS declines ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ), while five studies ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Brown et al. , 2011 ; Carmina et al. , 2012b ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ) indicated non-significant changes from baseline.    Androstenedione  Two studies compared changes in A 4 between women with and without PCOS, with one study indicating a significantly larger decline in women with PCOS than the control group ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ), and another study ( Forslund et al. , 2021 ) showing that the rate of decline was similar between the two groups of women. Among women with PCOS, two studies ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ) revealed that A 4 declined significantly from baseline, but four studies indicated no significant change ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Among women without PCOS, one study demonstrated a significant A 4 decline ( Udesen et al. , 2019 ), but another study showed significant increases ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ) and three studies ( Palomba et al. , 2007 , 2014 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) showed no significant change from baseline.    Sex hormone-binding globulin  Only two studies ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) compared SHBG changes between women with and without PCOS; both studies revealed that the change in SHBG was similar regardless of PCOS status. Among studies that reported SHBG change from baseline within PCOS women, two reported significant declines ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ), one observed a significant increase ( Forslund et al. , 2021 ), and three did not observe a significant change in SHBG levels ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ). In women without PCOS, three studies showed no significant differences over the time of the studies ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; 2014 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ), although two reported significant SHBG increases compared to baseline ( Udesen et al. , 2019 ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ).     Menstrual cycle regularity and chronic anovulation  One study demonstrated that women with PCOS had significantly fewer menstrual cycles per year compared to controls ( Brown et al. , 2011 ), although a higher proportion of women with PCOS regained regular menstrual cycles over time, and the proportion of women regaining normal cycles did not change in non-PCOS women. In addition, age of menopause did not differ between women with and those without PCOS ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ). We did not identify any longitudinal cohort studies that reported on the rate of chronic anovulation.    Other reproductive hormones   Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone  Of the three studies that compared change in AMH, one study reported a significantly faster rate of AMH decline ( Ahmad et al. , 2018 ) in women with PCOS than in women without, but two others reported no significant difference in change over time between the two groups of women ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Carmina et al. , 2012b ). Among studies that reported changes in AMH levels over time within the PCOS group, two demonstrated a significant decline from baseline ( Carmina et al. , 2012b ; Ng et al. , 2019 ), while one showed no significant change ( Brown et al. , 2011 ). Among women without PCOS, one study indicated no significant change in AMH levels from baseline ( Brown et al. , 2011 ), while another study revealed significantly lower AMH levels at follow-up compared to baseline ( Carmina et al. , 2012b ).    LH, FSH and LH/FSH ratio  One study ( Brown et al. , 2011 ) indicated that there was a more rapid decrease in LH levels per year in controls than in women with PCOS. However, two studies demonstrated that the mean change in LH over time was similar in women with and without PCOS ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Furthermore, one study reported that LH was significantly higher across the follicular and luteal phases in women with anovulatory PCOS than in controls, while LH was significantly higher in women with PCOS who had sporadic ovulation compared to non-PCOS women, but only during the follicular phase and not in the luteal phase ( Jarrett et al. , 2020 ). Within PCOS women, three studies showed no significant change in LH per year ( Brown et al. , 2011 ) or from baseline ( Carmina et al. , 2012b ; Ng et al. , 2019 ), while two others indicated significant increases from baseline ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Among women without PCOS, two studies showed significant increases in LH ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ), but one indicated a significant decline per year ( Brown et al. , 2011 ), and another showed no significant difference compared to baseline ( Carmina et al. , 2012b ).  One study reported that median FSH increased significantly in women with PCOS but decreased significantly in controls ( Brown et al. , 2011 ). Jarrett et al. (2020) , however, observed that FSH was significantly lower in women with PCOS and sporadic ovulation than in controls, although only during the luteal phase, but was similar between women with anovulatory PCOS and controls across both the luteal and follicular phases. Two studies ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ) showed similar changes in FSH from baseline in women with and without PCOS. Finally, Ng et al. (2019) observed a significant increase in FSH from baseline in women with PCOS; data in women without PCOS was not reported.  Three studies indicated that the change in the LH/FSH ratio over time was similar in both women with PCOS and without PCOS ( Carmina et al. , 2012a , b ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ), although one study demonstrated a significant decrease in the median LH/FSH ratio per year in women with PCOS, but not in controls ( Brown et al. , 2011 ).      Pregnancy outcomes  Data related to pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriages, early pregnancy losses, stillbirth, pre-term birth, congenital malformations, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertension in pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and birthweight, are shown in Table\u00a0III .  One study indicated that women with PCOS had a significantly higher cumulative rate of miscarriage than women without ( Palomba et al. , 2014 ), but another study did not observe a significant difference in the incidence of miscarriage and stillbirths between women with and without PCOS ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ). One study did not observe a significant difference in the incidence of pre-term birth and congenital malformations between women with and without PCOS ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ). Two studies suggested that the incidence of GDM was significantly higher in women with PCOS compared to those without ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ). One study reported that the cumulative rates of PIH were significantly higher in women with PCOS than in controls ( Palomba et al. , 2014 ), but another study did not observe a significant difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia between women with and without PCOS ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ).   Palomba et al. (2014) reported that babies born to women with PCOS had significantly lower mean birth weight than those born to women without PCOS, although Reyes-Munoz et al. (2012) did not observe a significant difference in mean offspring birth weight between women with and without PCOS. Finally, there were no studies that met our inclusion criteria regarding live births and neonatal mortality in women with, compared to those without, PCOS.    Oncological outcomes  One study indicated a similar incidence (0%) of endometrial cancer in both women with PCOS and controls ( Schmidt et al. , 2011b ), while another study ( Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ) showed that women with PCOS were eight times more likely to develop uterine cancer (presumably including endometrial cancer) compared to those without PCOS ( Table\u00a0IV ). Furthermore, the same studies reported that the incidence rate of breast cancer was similar between women with and without PCOS during the follow-up period ( Schmidt et al. , 2011b ; Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ).    Psychological outcomes  As shown in Table\u00a0IV , one Danish study reported a significantly higher incidence rate of anti-depressant medicine prescription in women with PCOS than in controls ( Altinok et al. , 2014 ). Greenwood et al. (2019b ) observed that the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scores in women with PCOS were two times higher compared to controls across the lifespan. However, another uncontrolled study among women with PCOS reported no significant change in the Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS) score and mood symptoms ( Greenwood et al. , 2019a ). Only one study reported that women with PCOS had an 18% higher risk of anxiety than those without PCOS ( Harnod et al. , 2020 ). We did not identify eligible studies that reported on the incidence rate of eating disorders over time in women with and without PCOS.     Discussion  This is the first comprehensive systematic review of longitudinal studies describing the natural history of reproductive, psychological and oncological outcomes in PCOS. It reports on outcomes aligned with the core outcomes set of recommended parameters that should be reported in PCOS studies ( Al Wattar et al. , 2020 ).   Diagnostic features and reproductive outcomes  This review demonstrates a uniform finding from two studies suggesting that clinical hyperandrogenism or mFG scores do not change significantly over time in either women with PCOS or those without PCOS ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ; Udesen et al. , 2019 ). However, besides having the shortest average follow-up period ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), one of the studies ( Palomba et al. , 2007 ) had a very limited sample size. Furthermore, mFG score varies by ethnicity ( Javorsky et al. , 2014 ) and a large cross-sectional study has suggested that mFG scores may decline with age in the general population ( Zhao et al. , 2011 ). Given the significant impact of hirsutism on quality of life ( Teede et al. , 2018a , b ), understanding the natural history of the disorder is important. Ethnic-specific evidence regarding mFG score changes across the life course are needed to provide insight into the natural history of hirsutism in PCOS and into how this may impact the diagnostic criteria of PCOS and the quality of life over time.  With respect to biochemical hyperandrogenism, SHBG, which impacts the free androgen status, was similar in women with and without PCOS. However, this evidence is from only two studies and participants in both studies were aged 49\u2009years at baseline ( Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Data are conflicting regarding total and free T, FAI and A 4 between women with and without PCOS, which may be attributed to differences in participant characteristics and laboratory cutoffs or assays used. A significantly higher decline in DHEAS was noted among women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS, consistently reported by all three studies assessing this hormone ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Schmidt et al. , 2011a ; Forslund et al. , 2021 ). Given that SHBG may be a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in PCOS ( Deswal et al. , 2018 ), more research on the natural history evidence and impact on biochemical hyperandrogenism as a diagnostic feature in PCOS is needed.  Despite menstrual irregularity being one of the cardinal features of PCOS diagnosis ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ; Teede et al. , 2018a ), evidence assessing changes in menstrual cycle regularity over time ( Brown et al. , 2011 ) was surprisingly insufficient in these cohort studies. This is consistent with the poor quality of data regarding menstrual cyclicity noted in the international guidelines ( Teede et al. , 2018a , b ).  Whether changes over time in other reproductive hormones, including LH, FSH and LH/FSH ratio, differ between women with and without PCOS is unclear, with conflicting findings and small numbers of relevant longitudinal studies. Findings from Jarrett et al. (2020) suggest that the levels of LH and FSH may differ significantly between women with and those without PCOS, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle assessed. Similarly, evidence as to whether there are differences in the rate of decline in AMH concentrations over time in women with or without PCOS is inconclusive ( Brown et al. , 2011 ; Carmina et al. , 2012b ). In addition to differences in the AMH assays and cutoffs values used, circulating levels of AMH tend to vary across PCOS phenotypes ( Rosenfield et al. , 2012 ; Teede et al. , 2019 ) and it is likely that there are phenotypic variations between participants, which may account for the conflicting results.    Pregnancy outcomes  The risk of GDM appears to be higher in women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS as shown by two studies ( Reyes-Munoz et al. , 2012 ; Palomba et al. , 2014 ). Although both studies were conducted in referred participants, this finding is consistent with the large body of literature from other systematic reviews of different study designs ( Toulis et al. , 2009 ; Palomba et al. , 2015 ; Bahri Khomami et al. , 2019 ). The finding also aligns with current PCOS guidelines, which emphasize assessing pregnant women with PCOS for GDM ( Teede et al. , 2018a , b ). Overall, we currently lack data from homogenous prospective studies among medically unbiased populations to provide a comprehensive natural history of GDM in PCOS. This will enable identification of those most at risk for timely intervention and management. Evidence related to other pregnancy-related outcomes, including PIH, pre-eclampsia, birth weight, pre-term birth, congenital malformations and maternal weight gain is largely limited, which calls for further research.    Oncological outcomes  Evidence as to whether the risk of endometrial or uterine cancer over time differs between women with and without PCOS is conflicting. Schmidt et al. (2011b ) observed no significant difference in these risks, while Cheng-Che et al. (2015) observed a significantly higher risk in women with PCOS. However, both studies were methodologically limited, with a small overall sample sizes and numbers of incident cases. Moreover, endometrial alteration ( Palomba et al. , 2021 ) and downregulation of various biological mechanisms in the endometrial stromal part ( Kim et al. , 2009 ) occurs more among women with PCOS compared to those without PCOS. Furthermore, multiple risk factors, such as obesity, pre-existing hypertension and diabetes, anovulation, parity and family history modulate the relationship between PCOS and endometrial cancer ( Navaratnarajah et al. , 2008 ) and studies that assess these factors are missing and hence there is a need for more evidence.  Similarly, additional longitudinal cohort studies assessing the risk of breast cancer between women with and without PCOS are needed, as the data are currently limited ( Schmidt et al. , 2011b ; Cheng-Che et al. , 2015 ).    Psychological outcomes  Although anxiety and depression are key symptoms experienced by women with PCOS ( Teede et al. , 2010 ; Tay et al. , 2019 ), longitudinal studies assessing these features are limited and/or include non-comparable endpoints.    Strengths and limitations  In general, this review explores longitudinal changes in the reproductive, psychologic and oncologic features of PCOS over the life course. Our analysis focused on features and outcomes of PCOS as specified in the PCOS core outcomes set ( Al Wattar et al. , 2020 ), including only studies where participants had a confirmed PCOS status according to the international guideline-recommended diagnostic criteria ( Teede et al. , 2018a , b ). The major limitation in the data observed is that most included studies are limited in numbers and time of follow-up, heterogeneous across age groups, and varied in study setting, ethnicity, follow-up duration, types of assays or tests used and effect measures. The insufficient number of studies for each outcome did not allow for meta-regression to further assess heterogeneity. The variations between studies also did not allow meta-analysis, differentiation between the various ethnic groups and the various phenotypes of PCOS. Another key limitation is that a substantial number of studies were uncontrolled ( Jakubowicz et al. , 2002 ; Kerchner et al. , 2009 ; Carmina et al. , 2013 ; Greenwood et al. , 2019a ) thus, their contribution was rather limited.     Conclusion  Overall, our evidence synthesis indicates that there is still limited data that may be useful in exploring the long-term and natural history of PCOS and homogenous longitudinal studies reporting outcomes that are aligned with the PCOS core outcomes set are lacking. PCOS natural history related questions ( Supplementary Table SIII ) remain unanswered. Given the importance of understanding the natural history of PCOS, the need for long-term prospective cohort studies in well-profiled populations is paramount.
