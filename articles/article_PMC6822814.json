    "abstract": "What are the benefits and harms of receiving a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis in a community sample of women, including impact on psychosocial wellbeing, lifestyle choices and behaviour? Although some women benefit considerably from the diagnosis, such as through increased awareness and reassurance, women with minimal symptoms may experience more harm than benefit, including long-lasting anxiety and altered life plans. Disease labels can validate symptoms and play a vital role in understanding and coping with illness; however, they can also cause harm by evoking illness schemas about severity and permanence. Regarding PCOS, the diagnostic criteria have expanded over time to include women with milder phenotypes (such as those without signs of androgen excess). This has occurred despite limited investigation of the benefits and harms of the diagnosis and has increased the number of women diagnosed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone with 26 participants from April\u2013July 2018 to explore women\u2019s experiences with the diagnosis, including the benefits and harms of receiving the diagnosis and the impact on their life. In total, 26 women in the community self-reporting a diagnosis of PCOS (reporting mild to severe symptoms) made by a medical doctor, aged 18\u201345\u00a0years and living in Australia were recruited through social media. Data were analysed thematically using Framework analysis. The study identified a range of both positive and negative effects of a PCOS diagnosis in the immediate, short and long-term, which were influenced by symptom severity, expectations and experience. For women with previously unexplained and bothersome symptoms, it was a relief to receive a diagnosis, and this resulted in an increased understanding about the importance of a healthy lifestyle. By contrast, women with milder symptoms often reported feeling shocked and overwhelmed by the diagnosis, consequently experiencing anxiety about the associated long-term risks. The majority of women, regardless of symptom severity, experienced prolonged worry and anxiety about infertility, resulting for some in risk taking with contraception, unintended pregnancies, pressure to conceive early or altered life plans. With time, many women developed positive coping strategies and perceived the diagnosis to be valuable, including those who felt they had experienced minimal benefit or even harm. PCOS diagnosis was self-reported and the sample was highly educated. Fear of infertility was salient for many women, underscoring the need for accurate information, counselling and reassurance of fertility potential. Given the risk of significant consequences, health professionals should use a tailored approach to PCOS diagnosis to increase the benefits of appropriate and timely diagnosis for women affected by significant symptoms, while reducing the harms of unnecessarily labelling healthy women for whom the benefits of a diagnosis are small.

    "body": "WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PATIENTS?  Little is known about the impact of a diagnosis of PCOS on women\u2019s psychosocial well-being, behaviour and life choices. This is an important issue because the definition of PCOS has expanded to include women with milder forms of PCOS (such as those without signs of androgen excess), and therefore more women are being diagnosed.  This study explored the benefits and harms of being diagnosed with PCOS for women in the community. We found that some women benefited greatly from a diagnosis of PCOS. For example, the diagnosis gave them an explanation for bothersome symptoms and a greater understanding of how to look after their health. However, for women with very mild PCOS symptoms, the diagnosis often brought long-lasting fear and anxiety with few positive effects.  Most women in the study were worried about being infertile, despite research showing many women with PCOS have the same number of children as women without PCOS. Our study shows how fear of infertility can result in stress and anxiety, pressure to change life plans, risk-taking with contraception and, for some, unplanned pregnancy.  These findings highlight the importance of a more tailored, personalized approach to diagnosis and providing good quality information about fertility.     Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most commonly diagnosed endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is associated with infertility and adverse reproductive, metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes, such as insulin resistance, obesity and type II diabetes ( Dumesic et al. , 2015 ). Symptoms of PCOS include menstrual irregularities (oligo- or anovulation), signs of androgen excess [e.g. hirsutism (male-pattern hair growth), acne] and polycystic appearing ovaries ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS Workshop, 2004 ).  Diagnosis can be challenging as symptoms vary in severity and it can be difficult to differentiate normal variability from the abnormality of PCOS, especially in young women ( Skiba et al. , 2018 ). Symptoms can also vary by weight and ethnicity and can change across the lifespan ( Dumesic et al. , 2015 ). Given this complexity and uncertainty, it is not surprising that many women report experiencing long delays and seeing multiple providers before receiving a diagnosis ( Gibson-Helm et al. , 2016 ), resulting in a negative impact on psychosocial outcomes and quality of life ( Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002 ; Avery and Braunack-Mayer, 2007 ). To add to the uncertainty, diagnostic criteria for PCOS have expanded over time ( Table I ) to include women with milder phenotypes of PCOS (such as those without signs of androgen excess), without clear evidence of benefit ( Wang and Mol, 2017 ), increasing the number of women diagnosed ( Copp et al. , 2017a ; Skiba et al. , 2018 ). As a result, there is concern over both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of PCOS ( Copp et al. , 2017a ; Gibson-Helm et al. , 2016 ; Skiba et al. , 2018 ).  Potential benefits of receiving a PCOS diagnosis include an explanation and validation of symptoms ( Avery and Braunack-Mayer, 2007 ; Rowlands et al. , 2016 ). It is also suggested that a timely diagnosis may help women with family planning, improve access to treatment and motivate them to implement healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the metabolic and cardiovascular risks associated with PCOS ( Chan et al. , 2017 ; Cooney and Dokras, 2018 ). However, it is unclear whether knowledge of the diagnosis reduces these risks. Additionally, the additional phenotypes introduced by the expanded Rotterdam criteria do not have the same increased risk of long-term implications ( Daan et al. , 2014 ; Lizneva et al. , 2016b ; de Wilde et al. , 2017 ), and current evidence is limited by referral bias as most studies recruit women from specialist clinics, hospital settings and PCOS support groups, who typically have more severe symptoms than women in the community ( Azziz et al. , 2016 ; Lizneva et al. , 2016a ).   Table I    Existing diagnostic criteria for PCOS .           National Institutes of Health (1990) ( Zawadzki, 1992 )  Rotterdam * (2003) ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS Workshop, 2004 )  Androgen Excess and PCOS society (2006) ( Azziz et al. , 2006 )      Need both: - Oligo-ovulation or anovulation - Clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism And exclusion of other causes  Need two of the following: - Oligo-ovulation or anovulation - Clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism - Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound And exclusion of other causes  Need: - Clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism AND one of the following: - Oligo-ovulation or anovulation - Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound And exclusion of other causes        * Endorsed in 2018 by new international guidelines on PCOS for use in adult women ( Teede et al. , 2018 ). PCOS: polycystic ovary syndrome     This uncertain benefit of a diagnosis needs to be weighed against the potential harms of disease labelling. An increasing body of research in various medical conditions suggests that there are psychological, social, physiological and behavioural harms associated with labelling people with a medical diagnosis ( Ogedegbe, 2010 ; Nickel et al. , 2017 ; Hanmer et al. , 2019 ; Turnwald, 2019 ). One reason for concern over unnecessary labelling of PCOS is that women with PCOS have higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, disordered eating behaviours and poorer self-esteem ( Dokras et al. , 2011 ; Dokras et al. , 2012 ; Rowlands et al. , 2016 ; Damone et al. , 2018 ; Lee et al. , 2018 ). It is unclear whether these problems are a direct consequence of the condition itself and its symptoms or whether they may also be due to the PCOS label and its associated long-term implications ( Moran et al. , 2012 ; Veltman-Verhulst et al. , 2012 ; Cooney et al. , 2017 ; Copp et al. , 2017b ; Damone et al. , 2018 ). Several studies suggest potential psychological harms associated with a diagnosis of PCOS. Diagnosed women may perceive they have poorer control over their weight ( Lin et al. , 2018 ), despite no clear evidence of such links ( Kataoka et al. , 2017 ; Brower et al. , 2018 ). They may also fear infertility, despite similar live birth rates to women without PCOS ( Holton et al. , 2018 ; Varanasi et al. , 2018 ). Qualitative findings of small clinical samples or women recruited from PCOS support groups suggest that, in addition to psychological distress ( Jones et al. , 2011 ), the prospect of infertility may also have behavioural consequences, such as unprotected sex due to perceptions of infertility ( Jones et al. , 2011 ) or feeling pressured to have children earlier than planned ( Williams et al. , 2015 ). Whether women in the community and those with milder symptoms have similar experiences is unclear.  Overall, evidence of the impact of a diagnosis of PCOS is scarce, and no studies have explicitly investigated the benefits and harms of receiving a diagnosis from the women\u2019s perspective. Given the risk of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis, the uncertain clinical benefit of knowing this diagnosis needs to be weighed against the potential harms in women labelled with PCOS. We addressed these knowledge gaps by qualitatively exploring the balance of benefits and harms of receiving a PCOS diagnosis for women in the community who vary in type and severity of symptoms. In particular, we explored from women\u2019s perspectives the impact of the diagnosis on their psychological well-being, lifestyle and behaviour, over the short and long term.    Materials and Methods   Design  This qualitative study used semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews to explore women\u2019s experiences with the diagnosis and management of PCOS, including the benefits and harms of receiving the diagnosis and the impact on their life (see Supplementary Data A for the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies checklist).    Ethics approval  Approval was obtained through the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (number 2017/878). Each participant provided written informed consent.    Sample  Participants were 26 women self-reporting a diagnosis of PCOS. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of PCOS by a medical doctor, currently aged 18\u201345\u00a0years and living in Australia.    Recruitment  Participants were recruited through paid Facebook advertising. Social media was utilized in order to recruit a more diverse sample than previous studies, which tended to recruit women from outpatient clinics or PCOS online support groups only, where women typically have more severe symptoms and phenotypes ( Azziz et al. , 2016 ). The advertisement directed interested respondents to the participant information statement and a questionnaire (Supplementary Data B) used to collect contact details and self-reported symptoms and severity of PCOS. This information was used to purposively identify participants with a range of different PCOS symptoms and severity levels (maximum variation sampling; Palinkas et al. , 2015 ).  Given that women with milder symptoms and signs of PCOS have been under-represented in previous literature, a second advertisement specifically targeted to women who identified with mild PCOS was later used to ensure that such women were well represented in the sample. A total of 71 women expressed interest in being involved in the study and completed the questionnaire. Thirty-seven responded to the first advertisement (of which 19 were contacted and 18 were interviewed) and 34 responded to the second advertisement (of which eight were contacted and were interviewed). Recruitment continued until preliminary analysis during data collection suggested thematic consistency regarding the benefits and harms of receiving a PCOS diagnosis, indicating saturation of key themes.

The guide was first piloted with three women with PCOS. Topics included participants\u2019 experience with diagnosis and management, perceived benefits and harms of receiving the diagnosis and the impact of the diagnosis on their life (Supplementary Data C). The interviewer was a female public health researcher with a background in psychology and experience with conducting qualitative interviews. Interviews were conducted between April and July 2018, lasted 25\u201380\u00a0min and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.    Analysis  Interview data were analysed thematically using Framework analysis ( Ritchie, 2003 ). To ensure rigour, a step-by-step collaborative approach to analysis was undertaken. Throughout data collection, the interviewer (T.C.) regularly met with colleagues (J.J., J.H., K.M., J.D.) to discuss salient impressions as they arose, forming a preliminary list of codes. T.C. then reviewed all transcripts and developed a list of arising salient themes. Three more researchers (K.M., D.M. and J.J.) read a sample of the transcripts to identify additional themes and assist in drafting the coding framework, which was also informed by the interview guide. The data set was then coded by T.C. A random subset of the data (10%) was double coded by D.M. to ensure consistency. Similarities or differences in the coding were discussed and re-assessed. Prominent themes were then identified and discussed in-depth with the research team to develop the interpretation of overall study findings.     Results   Sample characteristics  The mean age of participants was 29.3\u00a0years, over half had a bachelor degree or higher, and most were in a relationship or married ( Table II ). The majority had been diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 25\u00a0years. The symptom that most often prompted seeking medical attention was irregular cycles. Time since diagnosis varied from 6\u00a0months to 27\u00a0years (median 6.5\u00a0years) and time from first seeking medical attention to receiving diagnosis ranged from 1\u00a0week to 8\u00a0years. Participants varied widely in symptoms reported, number of symptoms at diagnosis, self-reported severity of PCOS and impact on life.    Thematic analysis findings  Four main themes were identified relating to the impact of being diagnosed with PCOS: initial appraisal, psychological impact, behavioural consequences and coming to terms with the diagnosis. Participant quotes are used to illustrate themes. Additionally, three case studies highlight individual stories of women who represent diverse experiences across these four themes and differ regarding their expectations, symptoms and experience. Pseudonyms are used throughout.    Initial appraisal  Initial appraisal and personal interpretations of the PCOS label varied widely and were influenced by a number of factors, such as symptom severity, pathway to diagnosis, expectations and the doctor\u2019s approach to communication. Some women had long suspected they might have PCOS and were relieved to finally have an explanation for previously ongoing, bothersome symptoms. \u2018In a way relieved because I finally knew that there was something, it wasn\u2019t just my imagination. It wasn\u2019t just me saying, you know, there\u2019s something not right and nothing was found.\u2019 (Maree, 32\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 30\u00a0years).  Others expressed feeling shocked by the diagnosis, or feeling alarmed and overwhelmed, as they had perceived their symptoms to be relatively minor and had not considered them indicating a serious condition. These feelings were further exacerbated after hearing about the associated risks of PCOS, such as infertility, endometrial cancer and type II diabetes. \u2018 This is just like really out of the blue. \u2018Cause I remember like my intention coming to the GP was, oh, my period\u2019s just a little bit irregular, can you put me on a pill to be regular? ...And in my head it\u2019s like, oh, it can\u2019t be that serious, right? I just want my period to be regular.\u2019 (Gloria, 25\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 19\u00a0years).  A few women had mixed emotions, where the diagnosis initially brought relief to have an answer for bothersome symptoms, but also uncertainty and stress regarding their future. \u2018 Maybe a little bit relieved to know what was wrong with me and that it could sort of be managed. But probably more sort of worried about how it was going to affect me in the future.\u2019 (Ella, 27\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 16\u00a0years).  Many expressed frustration, sadness and despair regarding the lack of long-term solutions, contributing to feelings of dissatisfaction with the diagnostic experience. \u2018But it was also a bit upsetting to know, well we really don\u2019t know a lot about it, we don\u2019t know how to cure it.\u2019 (Louise, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years).  On the other hand, a couple of participants described feeling \u2018 indifferent \u2019, not bothered about their diagnosis or that it \u2018 didn\u2019t really matter \u2019 (Darcy, 20\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 20\u00a0years). These participants were often diagnosed in their late teens or early 20\u2019s and stated that they were not \u2018 ready to hear it \u2019 (Christina, 37\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 20\u00a0years) or willing to engage with it, as the long-term implications seemed too far away to consider. \u2018 She thought I\u2019d be really concerned about that but really kids is the last thing on my mind. I\u2019m just trying to finish my degree (laughs).\u2019 (Darcy, 20\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 20\u00a0years).    Psychological impact of being diagnosed with PCOS  Women described various positive and negative impacts on their psychological well-being as a result of being diagnosed with PCOS, which were influenced by the symptoms they experienced and their expectations at diagnosis.   Positive impact  For some women experiencing bothersome symptoms, the diagnosis validated their symptoms and had a positive impact on their psychological well-being. Prior to being diagnosed, these women described feeling abnormal and that they were \u2018 turning into a boy \u2019 (Louise, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years). Receiving a medical diagnosis legitimized their experience and made them feel less abnormal. \u2018 It wasn\u2019t just me, it was actually a hormonal illness. \u2019 (Kate, 18\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 12\u00a0years).  Some felt reassured to find out (either from their doctor or via searching online) that PCOS is common, and benefited from knowing they were not \u2018 the only person that experiences this \u2019 (Elisabeth, 31\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 20\u00a0years).  Many participants commented that the diagnosis brought increased understanding and clarity about how their body works (Case study 1). Two women said this resulted in them feeling empowered and in control regarding management, and that the diagnosis opened doors to accessing treatment. \u2018I guess mentally and emotionally I feel that it was benefit to have that diagnosis to be explained, you know, that myriad of factors that was sort of going on with my health. Um, it also allowed me access to, you know, medication like Metformin, which is typically used for diabetes management.\u2019 (Anna, 24\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 19\u00a0years).     Case study 1. ANNA  Anna was diagnosed at 19\u00a0years old (life stage: late adolescence) and was 24\u00a0years when interviewed. Anna reported having symptoms since puberty, such as seemingly inexplicable weight gain, irregular menstruation and excess hair growth (symptoms: bothersome). She visited the doctor about her symptoms when she was 15\u00a0years old and was prescribed the oral contraceptive pill but was not officially diagnosed until, aged 19\u00a0years, she raised the possibility of PCOS to her GP herself (expectations: suspects PCOS). Anna felt \u2018 frustrated \u2019 that the GP dismissed her symptoms as \u2018 just a regular part of puberty \u2019 and attributable to her failure in maintaining a healthy lifestyle .  Initial reaction: For Anna, receiving the diagnosis was a \u2018 relief \u2019 as it was something that she had suspected for some time and it \u2018 provided an answer \u2019 to symptoms, such as her weight management, which she felt she was being \u2018 unfairly blamed for \u2019.  Psychological impact: The diagnosis had a positive impact on Anna\u2019s well-being, as prior to being diagnosed she felt that she was being blamed for her symptoms , which had started to impact her emotionally and psychologically . The diagnosis gave her increased understanding and reassurance, which stopped her from feeling at fault for her symptoms.  Fear of infertility: Learning of the risk of infertility had a negative impact, however, as she had always \u2018 counted on being able to have children \u2019. Anna described how the diagnosis gave her \u2018 some concerns and worries \u2019 about her fertility, which were difficult to process at her age.   Table III    Fertility-related psychosocial impacts of the PCOS diagnosis .          Psychosocial impact  Supporting quote      Emotional impact and thought processes   \u2018I feel really crappy just about being diagnosed and about being diagnosed while wanting to start [trying] for a baby\u2019 (Harriet, 29\u00a0years, age dx:29, 0 children)    Perceived loss of control  \u2018 The implications for fertility \u2026 because it\u2019s not something that anyone wants to have decided for them. That if you\u2019re going to have kids or not have kids, then it feels like it should be something you choose. Like to have that, um, imposed is quite disempowering.\u2019 (Alex, 35\u00a0years, age dx:25, 0 children)    Threatened expectations and dreams for the future   \u2018It\u2019s challenged my whole idea of what I wanted for my future. It\u2019s like that idea has been shaken a bit \u2026 I really just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. What will happen if I can\u2019t have a baby at all? And the thought just absolutely petrifies me.\u2019 (Harriet, 29\u00a0years, age dx:29, 0 children)    Altered parenthood goals   \u2018I think that I have accepted that it\u2019s likely \u2026 to be difficult for me to have kids. And, um, and so \u2026 it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever really pursued.\u2019 (Alex, 35\u00a0years, age dx:25, 0 children)    Persisting fear of infertility despite previously conceiving naturally without difficulty  \u2018 I remember second time round, \u2018cause I was a bit older, and I was planning to have a second baby and, um \u2026 I remember it didn\u2019t happen for 6\u00a0months so I got myself quite upset by that, and thought that\u2019s it, this is the infertility \u2026 I felt like I was in a rush a little bit. I panicked. Because I sort of felt I was on the back foot with PCOS.\u2019 (Annette, 43\u00a0years, age dx:22, 2 children)      Behavioural consequences: Anna described how her perceptions of her reduced fertility resulted in her taking risks with contraception as she \u2018 became convinced \u2019 that children would not be an option and ended up falling pregnant aged 19\u00a0years. Deciding whether to continue with the unintended pregnancy was an extremely emotional process. Anna was concerned that she might never get pregnant again and did not feel she would be able to live with herself if she \u2018 terminated a pregnancy and then struggled in 10\u00a0years \u2019 when she felt ready to have a child. She described feeling \u2018 very angry \u2019 that no one had told her that the effect of PCOS on her fertility was not as severe as it was made out to be. Anna\u2019s understanding of her fertility from that diagnosis resulted in her decision to continue with her pregnancy, \u2018which was unexpected, and become a single parent at aged 20.\u2019  Coming to terms with the diagnosis: Anna described how PCOS is now just something that she lives with and that she does not think about it often, aside from when she would consider having more children. Overall, Anna feels that being diagnosed with PCOS was \u2018 a very positive experience \u2019 as having the diagnosis and explanation \u2018 resolved a lot of questions \u2019 about her health. (*Italicized text indicates verbatim quotes).   Negative impact  Some women reported feeling embarrassed by having PCOS, as for them the diagnosis \u2018sort of makes you feel like there\u2019s something \u2026 something bad wrong with you, that you have too much testosterone.\u2019 (Ella, 27\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 16\u00a0years). Two women described how the diagnosis threatened their self-image, as it did not fit with their perception of being healthy. \u2018I always consider myself very healthy and then I\u2019m like, oh no, I do have that thing (laughs).\u2019 (Julia, 28\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 19\u00a0years).  There were also consistent reports of diagnosis-related fear and worry about the future. Upon receiving the diagnosis, many women experienced persistent fears of becoming overweight or developing type II diabetes. This included women for whom PCOS was the only risk factor for diabetes and who were likely to be at lower risk of metabolic consequences (such as those of normal weight without insulin resistance). \u2018I\u2019m a little bit nervous in terms of, um, well mostly concerned because it increases the risks of a lot of chronic diseases.\u2019 (Julia, 28\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 19\u00a0years).    Fear of infertility  For most women, there was a strong focus on fertility and the inherent uncertainty the diagnosis brings. Women reported feeling \u2018 super sad \u2019 (Harriet, 29\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 29\u00a0years) when contemplating their ability to conceive and described fear of infertility being \u2018 always in the background \u2019 (Ella, 27\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 16\u00a0years). This was the case even if they had previously conceived without difficulty. Some participants discussed how the diagnosis and their pervasive worry about future infertility influenced when they would start trying for a baby. Ella, for example, described PCOS as \u2018 dictating \u2019 her decision to begin trying to conceive \u2018 earlier rather than later \u2019. Some described how their potentially reduced ability to conceive threatened their expectations and dreams for the future, causing stress and anxiety. Others reported beginning to question what they wanted for the future, considering their life without children or changing their plans to have children. Table III provides examples of these fertility-related impacts of the PCOS diagnosis.     Behavioural consequences  Women\u2019s reports highlighted several motivational, social and behavioural consequences stemming from the PCOS diagnosis, with the majority related to the associated risk of infertility.   Risk taking with contraception  Many discussed how the diagnosis and their perceptions of reduced fertility resulted in taking risks with contraception. Three women also reported unintended pregnancies due to the belief that they would need medical assistance to conceive and that contraception was likely not necessary. \u2018 I basically thought that I would never get pregnant, so the unplanned pregnancy happened \u2026 you really do get that argument in your head that, look it\u2019s not easy for me, I may never get pregnant, so you know, you\u2019re not always that careful.\u2019 (Louise, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years).    Family planning  Some women discussed feeling pressured to have children earlier than they would have liked because they were concerned that if they left it later they would be unable to conceive. A few women did have children earlier than preferred, which was seen to impact on their careers. \u2018 Yes, that did put the career on hold. I focused on having the children early... I felt with the diagnosis, yeah, you\u2019re always thinking about, you know, that fertility side of it. So, yeah, it does affect your decisions.\u2019 (Louise, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years).  Some women also discussed how they would not terminate an unintended pregnancy if it was to occur due to worry that it might be their only chance to conceive (Case study 2). \u2018Even if we aren\u2019t ready we don\u2019t really want an abortion because it could be our only chance to create a life between us .\u2019 (Gloria, 25\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 18\u00a0years).  Conversely, a few women were diagnosed with PCOS after experiencing infertility and felt frustration and anger that the condition had not been picked up sooner. These women often wished they had known about the risk of infertility so they could have started trying to conceive earlier. \u2018 My biggest gripe was the fact that I have had irregular periods my whole life \u2026 it was only really when I was trying to get pregnant that it was picked up \u2026 my husband and I probably would have started trying to conceive much earlier. \u2019 (Madeline, 37\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 29\u00a0years).  There were, however, a minority of participants who reported that the diagnosis had no impact on family planning. \u2018We are trying for a second at the moment. But that\u2019s more looking at my age more so than anything specific with the PCOS.\u2019 (Alison, 34\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 22\u00a0years).     Case study 2. GLORIA  Gloria was diagnosed at 18\u00a0years old (life stage: late adolescence) and was 25\u00a0years when interviewed. Gloria was diagnosed after having irregular periods since puberty. She was referred to a gynaecologist, and test results showed polycystic ovaries and abnormally high androgens. Gloria described having acne, but as she has had no trouble with excess hair or weight, considers her PCOS as mild (symptoms: mild). The gynaecologist explained to Gloria that PCOS will decrease her fertility rate and increase her risk of diabetes.  Initial reaction: Gloria described feeling \u2018 a bit scare d\u2019 when diagnosed and described how it was a \u2018serious medical condition\u2019 and it felt \u2018 really out of the blue\u2019 (expectations: PCOS unexpected). The diagnosis for Gloria was \u2018 quite confronting\u2019 , as it is something that \u2018 can affect your lifestyle and quality of life\u2019. However , Gloria reflects that \u2018 it could have been a lot worse. It could have been cancer or anything. But really it\u2019s just an irregularity of your hormones, unfortunately.\u2019  Psychological impact: Although being diagnosed has not changed her way of life , Gloria reports that having the diagnosis has \u2018cleared up a lot of cloud\u2019 in her mind and increased her understanding .  Fear of infertility: The information about her reduced fertility was \u2018 pretty confronting\u2019 for Gloria as she did not think it would have any effect on her fertility , and it has made her \u2018 very apprehensive\u2019, causing her to question whether she wants children, when to start trying for children, and whether she should even try if her chances are already decreased.  Behavioural consequences: Gloria discussed how she has had conversations with her partner about how PCOS can affect fertility and how if they fell pregnant unintentionally they would continue with the pregnancy even if they were not ready for a baby, due to risk of future infertility.  Coming to terms with the diagnosis: Gloria reports that her only worry is the uncertainty surrounding her fertility. However, she further goes on to explain that she tries to \u2018see it as a positive\u2019 as now she has the diagnosis she knows what to do. Overall, Gloria finds her PCOS \u2018 manageable\u2019 and often forgets she has PCOS as \u2018 it\u2019s really nothing\u2019 and it \u2018doesn\u2019t play a huge part\u2019 in her life at the moment.   Interactions with partners  Participants reported both positive and negative impacts of the diagnosis on their relationships with their partners. A few women discussed how the diagnosis placed pressure on the couple to start a family earlier than they would have liked, and some reported feeling obligated to discuss their diagnosis early in the relationship to make the partner aware of their potentially reduced fertility. \u2018Obviously I had to tell him about the fact that I knew I could not conceive naturally. So that was very difficult for me. I was very nervous \u2018cause it\u2019s a very hard thing to, to say to someone when you\u2019re in a new relationship and you don\u2019t want to freak anyone out either when it\u2019s new, but I just felt that when you\u2019re with someone that they deserve to know if you feel that it\u2019s going to be serious.\u2019 (Ciara, 26\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 21\u00a0years).  Others reported the diagnosis strengthened their relationship through newfound support from their partner or gaining greater clarity as to why they were struggling to conceive. \u2018He now understands a bit better what I\u2019m going through \u2026 now that he knows it\u2019s actually real, it\u2019s actually a condition he\u2019s a bit more supportive \u2026 it\u2019s actually been quite positive.\u2019 (Maree, 32\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 30\u00a0years).    Diet and exercise changes\u2014the good and the bad  Regarding lifestyle recommendations, some women reported the diagnosis was \u2018 a wake-up call \u2019 (Annette, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 22\u00a0years) through increased awareness about the higher risk of developing type II diabetes, and it motivated them to implement healthy lifestyle changes. \u2018 I\u2019m one step ahead of knowing I might be susceptible to getting diabetes... I lost weight, which was probably a healthy thing to do.\u2019 (Annette, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 22\u00a0years).  However, many participants at the same time spoke of their struggle to maintain their motivation and weight over time, illustrating the challenge with maintaining lifestyle changes. Others discussed difficulty in finding motivation or felt no need to alter their lifestyle. A few participants also described becoming \u2018obsessed about\u2019 (Louise, 43\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years) maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to fear of weight gain and developing associated problems like diabetes, which affected their psychological well-being. \u2018 I was probably worried that I was going to become overweight and maybe a little bit paranoid about making sure I didn\u2019t eat too much and making sure I exercised.\u2019 (Ella, 27\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 16\u00a0years).     Coming to terms with the diagnosis  Although participants varied in their experiences and consequences of receiving a diagnosis of PCOS, the majority developed positive coping strategies, such as thinking optimistically and coming to terms with the diagnosis, either through resignation or acceptance. Some participants also expressed forms of resilience and strengthened resolve around their health and described their personal strength to carry on and put things into perspective. \u2018 I guess just knowing that at the end of the day I have it. There\u2019s nothing I can do about being diagnosed with it. It is what it is. It\u2019s part of who I am now and just trying to take that in my stride and deal with it in my everyday life, it\u2019s up to me how my thoughts are affected by it really.\u2019 (Harriet, 29\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 29\u00a0years).  Participants discussed the wide variation in PCOS symptom severity, often comparing their symptoms to other women with PCOS (either friends or others encountered online) and saying they felt fortunate their PCOS was quite mild in comparison, illustrating their positive outlook towards their own situation. \u2018Compared to some women who have, you know, really unfortunate symptoms, I\u2019m pretty lucky \u2026 it could be much worse so I don\u2019t really mind it.\u2019 (Amy, 31\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 15\u00a0years).   Figure 1    Summary of women\u2019s responses to a diagnosis of PCOS and the factors that influence their response. PCOS: polycystic ovary syndrome. The women in this study were from the general community.      Weighing up the benefits and harms of a diagnosis  When asked to weigh up the benefits and harms, most participants perceived the diagnosis to be more beneficial than harmful and were glad to know they had PCOS, even those who had been negatively impacted or considered the diagnosis to provide minimal benefit. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I think the immediate \u2026 the immediate benefit to harm was definitely harmful. Um, more of the emotional and psychological stuff \u2026 But I think in the long-term having that diagnosis helps in the physical regard to manage the symptoms and \u2026 maybe not just even manage the symptoms but manage the condition and just to be aware of it.\u2019 (Alex, 35\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 25\u00a0years).  A few women described an equal balance of benefits and harms, and two women reported more harm than benefit (Case study 3). \u2018 I would say 50/50 definitely. Because I\u2019ve been diagnosed, you know, you\u2019re aware, you can learn how your body is working, you can learn what is good and bad for your body and how to manage it \u2026 but again, harm I would say 50% because of the mental health side of things. It can be really, you know, stressful [in regards to fertility etc]. \u2019 (Nicole, 31\u00a0years, age diagnosed: 24\u00a0years).     Case study 3. JULIA  Julia was diagnosed at 19\u00a0years old (life stage: late adolescence), and was 28\u00a0years when interviewed. She was diagnosed as a result of an MRI for a hip injury, which incidentally detected polycystic ovaries. She was referred to a gynaecologist who diagnosed her with PCOS . Prior to diagnosis, Julia acknowledged that she had always had irregular periods, but did not seek medical advice as she thought it was \u2018 probably normal\u2019 as she was \u2018 very active\u2019 and had not really thought about it (symptoms: minimal).  Initial reaction: The PCOS diagnosis was very unexpected and the risks of infertility, cancer and diabetes listed by the gynaecologist was \u2018 a lot to take in\u2019 so young and \u2018 not the most tactful of deliveries\u2019 . Julia described feeling shocked and overwhelmed when diagnosed, as she went in \u2018 with a hip injury and came out with a condition\u2019 that she cannot cure (expectations: PCOS unexpected).  Psychological impact: The diagnosis for Julia has had a long-lasting emotional impact as worry about fertility and the \u2018 increased risks of a lot of chronic diseases\u2019 constantly plays on her mind and makes her feel \u2018 nervous\u2019 . Julia often wonders whether it would have been \u2018better not to have known about it\u2019 because she cannot do anything about it except her general lifestyle factors that she does anyway .  Fear of infertility: Julia describes how as she gets older she worries more and more about whether she will struggle to conceive and \u2018 whether children will be in the future\u2019. This has had a negative impact on her psychological well-being as it has caused some negative moments in terms of thinking about whether or not she can have children . This has also resulted in some challenging conversations with her partner , which Julia reports has been \u2018the hardest part to cope with\u2019 .  Behavioural consequences: The diagnosis has resulted in Julia thinking about trying to conceive \u2018 a lot earlier\u2019 than she would have without the diagnosis . Regarding her relationship with her partner, the diagnosis has caused Julia to have conversations with her partner \u2018 early\u2019 in their relationship to make sure he knew about the risk of infertility before they \u2018go any further\u2019. Julia tries to see this as \u2018 a good thing\u2019 as when they have difficulty conceiving in the future \u2018he\u2019ll know that already rather than being a little bit more blindsided\u2019. Julia reported making no changes to her health behaviour after being diagnosed as she was \u2018really active anyway\u2019 and that it \u2018didn\u2019t motivate\u2019 her to be any more active .  Coming to terms with the diagnosis: Julia expressed both positive and negative attitudes towards her PCOS. She called her PCOS \u2018 a mild case\u2019 when compared to other people, as she has never had any problems with weight or acne , expressing that she felt lucky she does not have many symptoms. However, Julia also described how she finds the diagnosis \u2018 really annoying\u2019 as it threatens her perception of being healthy and she perceives no benefit from knowing she has PCOS because it is not something she treats \u2018in any particular way\u2019 and often forgets to write on her medical history.  Overall, Julia sees the diagnosis \u2018as being more detrimental than being beneficial\u2019 and does not see \u2018 any benefit to having the diagnosis\u2019 as she does not have many symptoms, it resulted in no changes to management, and it \u2018 plays on your mind\u2019 due to \u2018 the associated risks and concerns it brings up in terms of children, and risks of future diseases and other chronic issues.\u2019   Factors influencing the variation across themes  Women\u2019s responses to a diagnosis and the variation across these themes were influenced by a number of factors, including their symptom severity, expectations prior to receiving a diagnosis and diagnostic pathway, life stage, individual differences and the doctor\u2019s communication at diagnosis, including their description of associated long-term implications such as infertility. The arrows in Figure 1 show these relationships between the main themes..      Discussion  In a community sample of women diagnosed with PCOS, the interpretation of the diagnosis and impact on their lives varied widely and was influenced by factors such as symptom severity, expectations and diagnostic experience. For women with bothersome symptoms, receiving the diagnosis confirmed that their symptoms were genuine, bringing clarity and certainty. The diagnosis provided these women a label with which to explain their experience, positively impacting their psychological well-being. For women with minimal symptoms or for whom the diagnosis was unexpected, their psychological well-being was negatively impacted, and the diagnosis mainly brought uncertainty and worry about the future. A key theme across women was fear of infertility, significantly affecting their lives and relationships. Regardless of their diagnostic pathway or symptom severity, the majority of women came to terms with the diagnosis and ultimately perceived it to be more beneficial than harmful, even those who felt it had brought minimal benefit or even substantial harm. Despite the range in time since diagnosis, no clear differences in women\u2019s experiences were observed.  This is the first study to explore the benefits and harms of receiving a diagnosis of PCOS for women in the community across the spectrum of symptom severity. The use of Facebook advertising allowed recruitment of a community sample of women Australia-wide, contrasting with previous studies that recruited from specialist clinics or PCOS support groups. The interview schedule was developed by a multidisciplinary team, including experienced qualitative researchers, PCOS experts and consumer representatives (women with PCOS), ensuring suitability and relevance. In addition, rigorous qualitative methods were used in analysis to reach final themes. Study limitations include self-reported diagnosis of PCOS, although reported symptoms were consistent with the Rotterdam criteria (except one participant who despite reporting polycystic ovaries alone identified with the diagnosis of PCOS) and that the sample was highly educated (61% holding a university degree). Although the majority perceived the diagnosis to be mainly beneficial overall, these women have already incorporated PCOS into their identity. As a result, they are subject to biases such as cognitive dissonance, where accepting the diagnosis facilitates the maintenance of positive emotional well-being ( Weiss and Bulmer, 2011 ; Hofmann, 2015 ).  Our findings bring together two bodies of literature regarding benefits and harms of disease labelling. The benefits described are consistent with previous research about the positive role of diagnostic labels in validating symptoms and supporting patients in understanding, responding to and coping with illness ( Avery and Braunack-Mayer, 2007 ; Noble et al. , 2019 ). At the same time, our findings also attest to negative impacts of disease labelling in inducing unwarranted fear and anxiety, activating schemas about severity and permanence, evoking feelings of hopelessness and resulting in disengagement with treatment and behaviours that are inconsistent with personal goals ( Haynes, 1978 ; Scherer et al. , 2013 ; Shaffer, 2018 ). More longitudinal research is needed to assess the benefit of knowing this diagnosis on clinical outcomes.  Additionally, women demonstrated several common misconceptions about PCOS, including the belief that PCOS causes weight gain or prevents weight loss ( Lin et al. , 2018 ), despite no evidence to suggest this is the case ( Kataoka et al. , 2017 ; Brower et al. , 2018 ), and that they were likely infertile, despite similar live birth rates to women without PCOS ( Joham et al. , 2014 ; Holton et al. , 2018 ; Varanasi et al. , 2018 ). It was difficult, however, to disentangle whether these misconceptions stemmed mainly from their doctor\u2019s communication of associated risks or more from the abundant misinformation about PCOS encountered online ( Chiu et al. , 2018 ) or any pre-existing beliefs. These findings emphasize the importance of better evidence-based communication to women and the need to address pre-existing beliefs. Accurate information about the likelihood of pregnancy may provide reassurance and support more informed decision-making about contraception.  In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering the benefits and harms for each individual woman to ensure clear benefit before ascribing the label. Harmful consequences of the diagnosis were evident across the spectrum of symptom severity; however, the perception of benefit was higher for certain groups, such as those with bothersome, impactful symptoms or women struggling to conceive. For these groups, the label seemed to offer notable advantages and our findings highlight the importance of a timely, accurate diagnosis for these women. For other women, however, a label may not be needed as the benefits of diagnosis were less clear and the risk of harm was high ( Moynihan et al. , 2019 ). Instead symptoms could be managed and a healthy lifestyle encouraged without a PCOS diagnosis ( Copp et al. , 2017a ). At the minimum, accurate information and personalized counselling regarding long-term risks in women with milder phenotypes and minimal symptoms is needed to help alleviate anxiety and fear in this expanding patient group.
