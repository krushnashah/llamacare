In this study, we demonstrated that the levels of the lncRNA SRLR were upregulated in PCOS patients with high expression of plasma IL\u20106 compared with heathy females. The levels of the lncRNA SRLR in the plasma had a positive correlation with expression of IL\u20106 in patients with PCOS but not in healthy females. Upregulation of the lncRNA SRLR in plasma could distinguish PCOS patients from healthy females. Overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR led to upregulation of IL\u20106 and promoted apoptosis of human granulosa\u2010like tumour cells (KGN). Therefore, the lncRNA SRLR participated in PCOS by regulating cell apoptosis and IL\u20106 expression. The lncRNA SRLR mediates its effects on apoptosis and IL\u20106 expression in PCOS and could be used to distinguish PCOS patients from healthy controls.

    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease which is characterized by polycystic ovary morphology, hyperandrogenism, and ovulation dysfunction. 1 , 2 It is a very common disease worldwide, and it has been reported that approximately 5% to 20% of females will develop PCOS during their reproductive age. 3 While PCOS is not life\u2010threatening, it is a leading cause of anovulatory infertility. 4 In addition, patients with PCOS have a high risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. 5 , 6 Despite increased efforts to prevent and treat PCOS, the long\u2010term prognosis for improved fertility is usually poor in a considerable number of patients.  At present, the pathogenesis of PCOS has not been fully elucidated, which leads to treatment difficulties. 7 Changes in apoptosis are the obviously pathology in the progress of PCOS, and the levels of apoptotic markers are used to detect and study this disease. 8 It has been reported that increased expression of IL\u20106 is linked to excess production of ovarian androgen, which is a major pathological process in PCOS. 9 Another study reported that the long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA) SRLR mediates drug resistance by upregulating IL\u20106 in renal cell carcinoma. 10   Thus, we hypothesized that the lncRNA SRLR may also interact with IL\u20106 in PCOS. In this study, we found that the lncRNA SRLR participated in PCOS by regulating apoptosis and IL\u20106 expression.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Subjects and granulosa cells  This study included 48 healthy women and 52 patients with PCOS, admitted to Wenling Hospital Affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University from October 2018 to April 2019. The selection of patients with PCOS depended on the diagnosis according to the Rotterdam Consensus (2004). The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 38\u2009years, with an average age of 30.4\u2009+\u20093.9\u2009years. The control group was 23 to 36\u2009years\u2009old, with an average age of 30.1\u2009+\u20093.4\u2009years. Age, body mass index, and other basic information between these two groups were not statistically different. Blood (3\u2009mL) was collected from each participant, and all plasma samples were prepared and stored at 4\u00b0C. The Ethics Committee of Wenling Hospital affiliated with Wenzhou Medical University approved the study.  Human granulosa\u2010like tumour cells (KGN) were established according to the method described by Nishi 11 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1; Life Technology) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).    2.2  Total RNA extraction and real\u2010time quantitative PCR  For real\u2010time quantitative PCR (qRT\u2010PCR) analysis, total RNA was isolated using the GenElute total RNA purification kit (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A NanoDrop 2000c was used to measure RNA purity and concentration, then cDNA was prepared using the Applied Biosystems large\u2010capacity DNA reverse transcription kit. The SYBR green quantitative kit (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was used for qRT\u2010PCR with GAPDH as the internal reference gene. The target gene lncRNA SRLR primers were designed and purchased from the Shanghai Sanggong Company. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by the Applied Biosystems 7500 real\u2010time PCR system software.    2.3  Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay  Human IL\u20106 was measured using a quantitative enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (D6050, R&D system). All operations were implemented strictly in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The level of IL\u20106 was standardized as pg/mL.    2.4  Cell transfection  The construction of the vector which expressed the lncRNA SRLR and the empty vector control were designed and purchased from Sangon (Shanghai, China), with the corresponding siRNA. KGN cells were cultured overnight, and the fusion rate reached 70% to 80% before transfection with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA). All experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The carrier dose was 12\u2009nM, and the siRNA dose was 40\u2009nM. Empty vector or negative control siRNA was used as a negative control (NC); the cells which were only treated with Liposome 2000 were used as the control (C).    2.5  Detection of apoptotic cells  KGN cells were collected and seeded into a 6\u2010well plate with a density of 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 4 cells/mL 24\u2009hours after the transfection; each well contained 3\u2009mL of medium. After 48\u2009hours of incubation, cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin and stained with Annexin V\u2010FITC and propidium iodide (PI). The apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry and was expressed as the total amount of Annexin\u2010V\u2010FITC+ cells.    2.6  Western blotting  Total protein was extracted from KGN cells using an extraction kit from Novus (NBP2\u201037853). Protein samples were denatured at 100\u00b0C and separated by SDS\u2010PAGE using a 10% gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, blocked with 5% evaporated milk for 1.5\u2009hours at room temperature, and incubated with antibodies. The main antibodies used were rabbit anti\u2010human IL\u20106 (1:2000, AB6672, Abcam) and anti\u2010GAPDH antibodies (1:1000, AB9485, Abcam). The blots were washed three times with PBS and incubated with goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG\u2010HRP secondary antibody (1:1000, MBS435036, MyBiosource). Protein bands were detected by X\u2010ray after incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, USA) for 3\u2009minutes. Image J v1.46 software was used to detect the expression of IL\u20106, which was standardized with GAPDH.    2.7  Statistical analysis  The data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Each experiment was carried out three times. An unpaired t test was used for comparison between two groups. Univariate analysis of variance and graph\u2010based tests were used to compare differences between three groups. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106. The diagnostic value of plasma lncRNA SRLR levels was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which analysed PCOS patients as truly positive and healthy women as truly negative. The difference was significant when P <\u2009.05, as shown with \u201c*.\u201d     3  RESULTS   3.1  Plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 in patients with PCOS were higher than those in healthy females  Through qRT\u2010PCR, we showed the plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR in PCOS patients were obviously higher than those in healthy females (Figure 1A ). In addition, ELISA results indicated that the plasma IL\u20106 levels in PCOS patients were obviously higher than those in healthy females (Figure 1B ).   Figure 1   Plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 are both upregulated in PCOS patients compared with heathy females. Levels of the lncRNA SRLR (A) and IL\u20106 (B) in plasma are significantly increased in patients with PCOS compared with healthy controls (* P <\u2009.05). PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome       3.2  A significant positive correlation was found between plasma lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 levels in patients with PCOS  To analyse the correlation between the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient to demonstrate a significant positive correlation between levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 in plasma of PCOS patients (Figure 2A ). There was no significant correlation between levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 in plasma from healthy controls (Figure 2B ).   Figure 2   The lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 are significantly and positively correlated in PCOS patients. The Pearson's correlation coefficient reveals a significant positive correlation between the plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 in PCOS patients (A) but not in healthy females (B). PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome       3.3  Upregulation of levels of plasma lncRNA SRLR differentiated PCOS patients from healthy controls  Through ROC curve analysis, the diagnostic value of the lncRNA SRLR levels in plasma was evaluated in PCOS patients, which were considered as the true positive, while healthy females were considered as the true negative. We found the area under the curve was 0.8534, the SD was 0.03662, and the 95% confidence interval was 0.7816\u20100.9252 (Figure 3 , P <\u2009.0001). Therefore, upregulated plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR could distinguish PCOS patients from healthy controls.   Figure 3   Upregulation of plasma lncRNA SRLR distinguishes PCOS patients from healthy controls. ROC curve analysis shows that upregulated plasma levels of the lncRNA SRLR distinguish PCOS patients from healthy controls. PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; ROC, receiver operating characteristic       3.4  Upregulation of the expression of the lncRNA SRLR resulted in upregulation of IL\u20106 in KGN cells and promoted cell apoptosis  At 24\u2009hours after transfection, the expression of the lncRNA SRLR was obviously increased in KGN cells (Figure 4A ). In contrast with the control group (C), which had no treatment, and NC, the overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR upregulated expression of IL\u20106 in KGN cells at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4B ). In addition, compared with the C and NC groups, KGN cells with overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR showed significantly increased cell apoptosis rates (Figure 4C ).   Figure 4   Overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR leads to upregulation of IL\u20106 in KGN cells and promotes cell apoptosis. After 24\u2010h transfection, the expression of the lncRNA SRLR is significantly increased in KGN cells (A). Compared with the control (C) and negative control (NC) groups, overexpression of lncRNA SRLR leads to upregulated expression of IL\u20106 in KGN cells (B), and increases the apoptotic rate of KGN cells (C) (* P <\u2009.05)       3.5  Silencing of the lncRNA SRLR resulted in the downregulation of IL\u20106 and inhibition of apoptosis in KGN cells  The knockdown of the lncRNA SRLR was achieved in KGN cells 24\u2009hours after transfection (Figure 5A ). In contrast with the C and NC groups, the silencing of the lncRNA SRLR resulted in the downregulation of IL\u20106 expression in KGN cells at both the level of protein and mRNA (Figure 5B ). Additionally, the knockdown of the lncRNA SRLR and treatment with LMT\u201028 (an IL\u20106 antagonist, Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) significantly inhibited apoptosis of KGN cells compared with the C and NC groups (Figure 5C ).   Figure 5   siRNA silencing of the lncRNA SRLR leads to downregulation of IL\u20106 in KGN cells and inhibits cell apoptosis. After 24\u2010h transfection with siRNA, the knockdown of the lncRNA SRLR was achieved in KGN cells (A). LncRNA SRLR siRNA silencing leads to downregulated expression of IL\u20106 in KGN cells at both the mRNA and protein levels (B). Compared with the C and NC groups, knockdown of the lncRNA SRLR and treatment with the IL\u20106 antagonist LMT\u201028 (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) leads to inhibition of the apoptosis of KGN cells (C) (* P <\u2009.05)        4  DISCUSSION  The lncRNA SRLR is a novel lncRNA which has a role as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma. 10 Nevertheless, the functionality of the lncRNA SRLR in other diseases remains unclear. The crux of this research was that upregulation of the lncRNA SRLR may also contribute to PCOS. The role of the lncRNA SRLR may be mediated by its effects on apoptosis and IL\u20106 expression in PCOS.  Increasing the number of studies have shown that the development of PCOS is accompanied not only by changes in protein expression but also by changes in non\u2010coding RNA expression, such as lncRNA. 12 Some differentially expressed lncRNAs, such as the lncRNA GAS5, have been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of PCOS and could be a potential target for treating PCOS. 13 The lncRNA SRLR is a recently discovered lncRNA, which only has known expression patterns and functions in renal cell carcinoma. 10 In this study, we first showed the upregulation of the lncRNA SRLR in PCOS. Actually, the upregulation of the lncRNA SRLR in plasma significantly distinguished PCOS patients from healthy controls. Consequently, plasma circulating levels of the lncRNA SRLR may be a potential target for the treatment of PCOS.  Altered apoptosis of granulosa cells is common in patients with PCOS. 14 , 15 , 16 At present, multiple signalling pathways, such as Akt\u2010mTOR, BMP15/Smad1, and FoxO3, have been shown to participate in the regulation of granulosa cell apoptosis in PCOS. In a recent study, the lncRNA\u2010LET was also shown to induce apoptosis of the granulosa\u2010like tumour cell line KGN. 17 Our study found that overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR promoted apoptosis of KGN cells. Therefore, the lncRNA\u2010LET may participate in PCOS by regulating apoptosis of KGN.  PCOS is accompanied with alterations in the expression of inflammatory factors in disease progression, indicating the nature of PCOS as an inflammatory disease. 18 In a recent study, an excess production of IL\u20106 was shown to be linked to excess production of ovarian androgen, which is a major pathological process in PCOS. 9 In this research, we found the overexpression of the lncRNA SRLR upregulated IL\u20106 expression in KGN cells, suggesting a positive interaction between the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106. Meanwhile, the levels of the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 in PCOS patients' plasma were significantly positively correlated, as compared with those in the control group. Thus, the interplay between the lncRNA SRLR and IL\u20106 may be mediated by pathological factors in KGN cells.  In summary, the lncRNA SRLR was upregulated in PCOS patients with high expression of IL\u20106. The lncRNA SRLR may participate in PCOS by regulating cell apoptosis and IL\u20106 expression.
