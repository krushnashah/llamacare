    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age 1 , affecting 6\u201321% of women worldwide 2 . Characteristics of PCOS include obesity, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries 3 . Due to endocrine disorders and anovulation in women with PCOS, which lead to infertility 4 , such women usually require assisted reproductive technology (ART) to become pregnant.  Applying PCOS diagnostic criteria, four phenotypes are distinguished: phenotype A: coexistence of clinical hyperandrogenism/hyperandrogenemia (HA), oligomenorrhea/anovulation (OA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM); phenotype B: HA and OA without PCOM; phenotype C: HA and PCOM with regular ovulatory cycles; and phenotype D: OA coexisting with PCOM 2 . Patients with different PCOS phenotypes show different ovarian responses to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) 5 , which might contribute to different pregnancy outcomes 6 . The previously published literature has mainly described pregnancy outcomes in patients with different PCOS phenotypes after fresh embryo transfer 6 , 7 ; patients with PCOS are prone to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during or after COH 8 . Clinically, a fresh embryo transfer is usually canceled to reduce the risk of OHSS 9 . However, it has been reported that frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) can not only reduce the risk of OHSS but also improve ART outcomes 10 . Recently, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of infertile women with PCOS suggested FET led to a higher rate of live births, and a lower risk of abortion than did fresh embryo transfer 11 . FET allows time for the use of preimplantation genetic technology 12 . Therefore, a considerable number of infertile patients choose to undergo FET. However, PCOS is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including an increased risk of abortion, premature delivery, pre-eclampsia, and even neonatal outcomes 13 , 14 . After removing the effect of COH on patients, studying the pregnancy outcomes of patients with different PCOS phenotypes after FET may better reflect the impact of different PCOS phenotypes on ART outcomes. Subsequent clinical management, which might optimize pregnancy outcomes, could then be carried out based on different PCOS phenotypes.  This study aimed to assess the effect of various PCOS phenotypes after FET on pregnancy outcomes.    Materials and methods   Study design and patients  This study retrospectively collected and evaluated the clinical data of 8903 patients after FET at the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, who were patients between January 2017 and October 2019. All women between the ages of 20 to 40\u00a0years with a body mass index (BMI) of no more than 35\u00a0kg/m2, underwent their first FET during their first in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle at our center. Informed consent was obtained from all patients in this study.  All women were excluded from this study if they (i) underwent frozen-thawed oocyte cycle or preimplantation genetic testing cycles, (ii) were diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency or a decreased ovarian reserve, (iii) had a history of unilateral oophorectomy, recurrent spontaneous abortion or severe intrauterine adhesion, (iv) had medical conditions that contraindicated assisted reproductive technology or pregnancy, and (v) were diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, abnormal renal function, uterine malformation or abnormal parental karyotypes.    Ethics approval and consent to participate  All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were following the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The institutional review board of the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University approved this study (2021-25), and all research was performed by relevant guidelines/regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.  All women were assigned to either PCOS (n\u2009=\u20091887) or control (n\u2009=\u20097016, women without PCOS, and the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria were also used to screen the control subjects.) groups. A diagnosis of PCOS was based on Rotterdam diagnostic criteria and if at least two of the following criteria were present: HA (hyperandrogenemia, defined as total testosterone levels above 48.1\u00a0ng/dL, and hirsutism with a total score\u2009\u2265\u20098 according to the Ferryman\u2013Gallwey score); OA (defined as a delay of\u2009>\u200935\u00a0days or\u2009<\u2009eight spontaneous hemorrhagic episodes/years); PCOM (defined as\u2009\u2265\u200912 small follicles measuring 2\u20139\u00a0mm in at least one ovary or ovarian volume\u2009\u2265\u200910 cm 3 ) 15 . Patients with PCOS were categorized into four phenotype groups according to Rotterdam criteria as follows 16 : phenotype A group (n\u2009=\u2009452): HA\u2009+\u2009OA\u2009+\u2009PCOM; phenotype B group (n\u2009=\u200988): HA\u2009+\u2009OA; phenotype C group (n\u2009=\u2009119): HA\u2009+\u2009PCOM; and phenotype D group (n\u2009=\u20091228): OA\u2009+\u2009PCOM.    Measurement  Patient data were obtained from our center records, including age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), duration and type of infertility, past medical history, a basic vaginal ultrasound, a basal hormone profile evaluation, and outcomes of COH, as well as laboratory and clinical features of FET cycles. Blood samples of a basal hormone profile were collected for assessment on days 2\u20135 of a spontaneous or progestin-induced menstrual cycle in all women. All the hormonal assays were performed in the laboratories of the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University.    Treatment  All patients received a standard ovarian stimulation protocol (the antagonist or the long protocols), oocyte retrieval, fertilization, embryo cultured and cryopreserved in vitro, and luteal phase support protocol after embryo transfer (ET), according to a routine method 17 . All the FET patients in this study were not suitable for fresh embryo transfer or did not get a viable neonate after fresh embryo transfer. The outpatient physician chose the appropriate protocol based on clinical indications to prepare endometrium and mainly included a natural cycle, hormonal replacement therapy cycle, and ovulation induction cycle. Frozen blastocysts were thawed and transferred, and subsequently provided luteal phase support protocol according to the different endometrial preparation programs 18 , 19 .    Outcomes of FET  The primary outcomes after FET were pregnancy outcomes consisting of biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy (CP), ectopic pregnancy, abortion, premature delivery, and live birth (LB). Biochemical pregnancy was indicated by a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level\u2009\u2265\u200910\u00a0IU/L on day 14 after ET. Clinical pregnancy was considered to detect the presence of a gestational sac by ultrasonography on day 35 after ET. A diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy occurred when a developing blastocyst was found implanted outside the endometrial cavity. Abortion was defined as a clinical pregnancy lost before 28\u00a0weeks gestation. Premature delivery was regarded as neonatal birth from the 28th to the 37th week of gestation. Live birth was considered as the delivery of any viable neonate at 28\u00a0weeks of gestation or later.    Statistical analyses  Group means were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (One-Way ANOVA or Welch\u2019s ANOVA was based on the results of the variance homogeneity test (Levene test). LSD (equal variances assumed) or Games-Howell (equal variances not assumed) were used for Post hoc multiple comparisons.) for quantitative variables, and a chi-squared test for qualitative variables. Quantitative variables were expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (normal distribution or near-normal distribution, Data were tested for normality by the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test), and qualitative variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (backward: conditional) was performed to compare adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of various PCOS phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes in FET, adjusted by the variates of P <\u20090.05 in univariate logistic regression analysis.  All analyses were performed with the use of SPSS software (version 23.0). Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.     Results   Patient\u2019s characteristics and outcomes of COH  A total of 8903 patients who underwent FET were enrolled in the present study and categorized as 1887 PCOS women and 7016 non-PCOS women. Of the 1887 women with PCOS, 452 showed phenotype A (HA\u2009+\u2009OA\u2009+\u2009PCOM, 23.95% of PCOS), 88 presented with phenotype B (HA\u2009+\u2009OA, 4.66% of PCOS), 119 revealed phenotype C (HA\u2009+\u2009PCOM, 6.31% of PCOS), and 1228 displayed phenotype D (OA\u2009+\u2009PCOM, 65.08% of PCOS), that may be related to the endocrine characteristics of the Chinese women. In addition, of the 7016 non-PCOS women in the control group, 218 showed HA (3.10% of non-PCOS women), 868 showed OA (12.40% of non-PCOS women), 1091 showed OA (15.60% of non-PCOS women).  The patient\u2019s baseline characteristics and ovarian responses of the four PCOS phenotypes and control group are listed in Table 1 . A significant difference did not exist in histories of spontaneous abortion and premature delivery, and the proportion of ICSI between the four PCOS phenotypes and control group ( P =\u20090.922, P =\u20090.495, respectively). No significant differences in the type of infertility, fasting blood glucose (FBG), gonadotropin dose, and high-quality embryos between the four PCOS phenotypes were found. Significant differences were observed in age, BMI, SBP, DBP, duration of infertility, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone (To) concentration, anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), the number of follicles of diameter\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0mm and estradiol (E 2 ) levels on the HCG trigger day, and the number of retrieved oocytes between the four PCOS phenotype and control groups (all P values were\u2009<\u20090.001).

A difference was found for endometrial thickness and the presence of a corpus luteum between the five groups ( P <\u20090.001 for both). Women with PCOS phenotype A showed an increased incidence of biochemical pregnancy, CP and premature delivery compared to those with PCOS phenotype D and in the control group (80.1% vs. 72.3% & 70.2%, P <\u20090.001; 71.0% vs. 64.9% & 62.9%, P =\u20090.005; 12.1% vs. 7.7% & 6.7%, P =\u20090.006, respectively), while the incidence of ectopic pregnancy and LB were comparable between the five groups ( P =\u20090.596, P =\u20090.397, respectively). We also found a significantly higher abortion rate (20.6% & 19.2% vs 15.2%, P =\u20090.010) and lower ongoing pregnancy rate (78.5% & 80.4% vs. 83.9%, P =\u20090.023) among PCOS phenotypes A and D compared to control groups.

Discussion  This study revealed a marked incidence of increased abortion in women of PCOS phenotype A and D groups after controlling for potential confounders. However, a finding of an elevated risk of premature delivery for the PCOS phenotype A group did not occur after controlling for potential confounders.  Abortion is a common complication of pregnancy. The etiology of abortion is complex: obesity 20 , insulin resistance 21 , hyperandrogenism 22 , the quality of oocytes, and endometrial abnormalities might be associated with the occurrence of abortion 23 , 24 . As reported in prior studies, women with PCOS are associated with an increased risk of abortion 25 , 26 . In addition, the incidence of abortion was increased in women who underwent ART 27 , with a possible mechanism related to corpus luteum insufficiency 28 .  In our study, the incidence of abortion was significantly increased in PCOS phenotypes A and D, and with the coexistence of OA and PCOM in PCOS phenotypes A and D. We speculate that the combination of OA and PCOM might increase the risk of abortion by affecting oocyte quality. Oocyte maturation and the fertility rate of anovulatory women were significantly lower than those of regular cycling women 29 ; their embryo development ratio followed a similar trend 30 . A study of anovulation in cows found that anovulation also leads to major shifts in gene expression in elongated conceptuses during preimplantation stages; transcripts involved with the control of energy metabolism and DNA repair were downregulated, whereas genes linked to apoptosis and autophagy were upregulated 31 . Furthermore, a recent study revealed decreased oocyte quality in PCOM due to the abnormal activation of one-carbon metabolism and hypermethylation of mitochondrial DNA 32 . These results support the above conjecture.  Moreover, we also observed that the rate for the presence of a corpus luteum (because of different endometrial preparation protocols for FET) in PCOS phenotypes A and D was significantly lower than that in controls, which might be another reason for the higher rate of abortion. In clinical practice, for PCOS women with OA, clinicians generally adopt a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) cycle to prepare the endometrium for FET 33 . Recently, Xu et al. 34 noticed that HRT cycles were related to a higher abortion rate, which is consistent with the results of a prior study 35 . The corpus luteum is an important source of hormones in pregnant women 12 , 36 , but during endometrial preparation, a corpus luteum is absent in an HRT cycle. Additionally, administering exogenous hormone in an HRT cycle might increase the risk of thromboembolic events and could damage placentation, which may then lead to abortion 37 , 38 .  It is generally known that obesity has an undesirable impact on women\u2019s reproduction 39 . Obesity increases the rate of abortion 40 and is an independent risk factor for abortion 41 . Obesity affects follicle development by affecting sex hormone secretion and metabolism 39 ; other studies have found adverse effects of obesity on the quality of the embryo 42 and endometrial receptivity 43 . In the present study, the BMI in PCOS phenotype A and D groups was significantly higher than that in the control group. Before the initiation of FET, obese women can reduce their weight to optimize pregnancy outcomes 44 . Interestingly, we also noticed that the age of the women with PCOS phenotypes A and D was lower than that of women in the control group. It is well documented that maternal age increases the incidence of abortion 45 , 46 . It is possible that other factors masked the effect of age on abortion. The average age of patients was 30.62\u2009\u00b1\u20094.07\u00a0years in our study, which may have a relatively small impact on abortion. Previous studies found that an advanced age increased the risk of abortion, usually over the age of 35 or 38 47 , 48 . In addition, previous studies have suggested that HA is associated with increased rates of abortion 49 . However, this was not found in our study. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis also showed that HA does not increase the risk of abortion in patients with PCOS 21 .  In this study, we found, for the first time, that women with PCOS phenotypes A and D had an elevated risk of abortion after FET. We speculated that this was associated with the coexistence of OA and PCOM by affecting the quality of oocytes and the formation of a corpus luteum. Therefore, for women with PCOS phenotypes A and D, lifestyle interventions such as improved diet and increased exercise were used to reduce body weight before FET; natural or ovulation-induced cycles are recommended as a priority for endometrial preparation in FET, and an appropriately increased luteal phase support. Additionally, pregnancy follow-up after obtaining a clinical pregnancy should be strengthened, and, with any sign of an abortion, treatment should be promptly provided.  However, the investigation of several risk factors, such as environmental factors, physical activities, and social factors, could not be included in this study. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, data on insulin resistance is lacking, and so was not included in the analysis. In addition, although we have the advantage of large sample size, due to the characteristics of the Chinese women, a large difference in sample size between various phenotype groups was observed. Therefore, a further, large-scale, and rigorous prospective validation study is necessary for the future.    Conclusions  In summary, our findings demonstrate women with PCOS phenotypes A and D had an elevated risk of abortion after FET, which might be associated with the coexistence of OA and PCOM by affecting the quality of oocytes and the formation of a corpus luteum. It is suggested that when performing FET, clinicians should individually manage women with PCOS phenotypes A and D to reduce the rate of abortion and increase the rate of LB, and achieve better pregnancy outcomes.",
