We did this network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of different drugs for reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS. We searched studies from inception until January 10, 2023, through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library database. All studies comparing different drugs for reducing testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome were included in this network meta-analysis. Outcomes were total testosterone levels, free testosterone levels, and withdraw due to adverse events. We calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each treatment.

However, the optimal dose of atorvastatin was unknown and should be verified by more randomized controlled trials.",
    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that impacts roughly 10% of women in their reproductive years. It is linked to a range of hormonal irregularities, including menstrual irregularities, insulin resistance, clinical hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenemia, and infertility. [ 1 , 2 ] Even with varying characteristics, these factors can all contribute to the development of PCOS. [ 3 ] In clinical trials, a reduction in testosterone levels is one of the most frequently reported outcomes, and healthcare providers commonly use this measurement to track a patient\u2019s progress. [ 4 , 5 ]  Recently, the use of statins as a treatment for PCOS has been introduced, either alone or in combination with metformin or combined oral contraceptives (COCs). [ 6 , 7 ] Although guidelines suggest lifestyle changes and weight loss for all PCOS patients, along with individualized use of COCs, metformin, or spironolactone based on patient presentation, the role of statins and their significance for patients with PCOS is still a matter of controversy.  According to studies, COCs are typically the first-choice treatment for managing menstrual irregularities in women with PCOS, as they reduce androgen levels, ultimately leading to the regulation of menses. [ 8 ] However, for those who cannot tolerate COCs, metformin has been shown in several trials to be effective in reducing androgen levels. [ 9 \u2013 11 ] Spironolactone has also been used to treat PCOS by inhibiting steroid synthesis, resulting in decreased androgen-induced symptoms, such as hirsutism and menstrual irregularities. [ 11 ] In addition, simvastatin and atorvastatin, typically used to treat hypercholesterolemia, have demonstrated comparable effectiveness to other antiandrogen agents in reducing androgen levels in women with PCOS. [ 12 ]  Since no studies have yet established the best treatment for patients with PCOS displaying high androgen-induced symptoms, the current research was carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of different drugs for reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS.    2. Material and methods  The network meta-analysis was performed following the guidelines of the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.   2.1. Search strategy  A search was conducted for potentially relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about different drugs including statins, COC, metformin, lifestyle modification, or spironolactone and placebo for treatment polycystic ovary syndrome on Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to February 15, 2023. A structured search was performed using the following search string: \u201cOvary Syndrome, Polycystic\u201d OR \u201cSyndrome, Polycystic Ovary\u201d OR \u201cStein-Leventhal Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cStein Leventhal Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cSyndrome, Stein-Leventhal\u201d OR \u201cSclerocystic Ovarian Degeneration\u201d OR \u201cOvarian Degeneration, Sclerocystic\u201d OR \u201cSclerocystic Ovary Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cOvarian Syndrome, Polycystic\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic Ovary Syndrome 1\u201d OR \u201cSclerocystic Ovaries\u201d OR \u201cOvary, Sclerocystic\u201d OR \u201cSclerocystic Ovary\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic Ovary Syndrome [Mesh]\u201d AND \u201cStain\u201d OR \u201cSpironolactone\u201d OR \u201cMetformin\u201d OR \u201clifestyle modification\u201d OR \u201cAtorvastatin\u201d OR \u201cSimvastatin\u201d OR \u201ccombined oral contraceptives. The detailed search strategies are presented in Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/K14 . In adherence to preestablished criteria, the titles, abstracts, and full publications were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or the involvement of a third reviewer to reach a consensus. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, reference lists, related citations, and gray literature from websites were manually searched. Since no patient contact occurred, ethical approval was not necessary.    2.2. Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria  To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to fulfill the PICOS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, study design) criteria as follows: population (P) - patients with PCOS; intervention (I)\u2014the intervention group received \u201cStain\u201d OR \u201cSpironolactone\u201d OR \u201cMetformin\u201d OR \u201clifestyle modification\u201d OR \u201cAtorvastatin\u201d OR \u201cSimvastatin\u201d OR \u201ccombined oral contraceptives\u201d; comparator (C); placebo; outcomes (O)\u2014total testosterone level, free testosterone level and withdrawn due to adverse events; study design (S)-RCTs. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS encompass various standards recommended by different organizations. These include the 1990 National Institutes of Health Standard, the 2003 European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Reproductive Medicine Standards, as well as the criteria proposed by the Rotterdam Expert Meeting of the European Society of Human Resources and Social Sciences/ASRM in 2003. Another set of diagnostic criteria is the 2012 National Institutes of Health expert consensus. These guidelines provide a framework for identifying and diagnosing PCOS. Retrospective studies, cadaver studies, comments, letters, editorials, protocols, guidelines, surgical registries, and review papers were excluded.    2.3. Literature selection  They first gathered all pertinent studies and imported them into Endnote X7 (EndNote X7, Thomson Reuters, NY, USA), eliminating any duplicate literature. Next, 2 researchers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts to exclude any studies that did not meet the PICOS criteria, removing any remaining irrelevant studies. If there was any disagreement about which literature to include, a senior reviewer was consulted.    2.4. Data extraction  The available data from the included studies, including author, study design, publishing year, age, sample size, gender, intervention, and control procedure, were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. The primary outcomes assessed were Total testosterone level, free testosterone level, and withdrawn due to the adverse events. If any data were missing, the corresponding author of the study was contacted to obtain the necessary information.    2.5. Quality assessment  The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed by 2 reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s risk of bias tool as depictive in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins JPT, Green S. Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions, version 5.1.0), which comprised items such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, reporting bias, and other bias. Each domain was assessed as low, unclear and high according to the instruction. In case of any discrepancies in the evaluations between the 2 reviewers, a third reviewer was consulted to resolve them.    2.6. Data analysis and statistical methods  For the network meta-analyses of efficacy outcomes, we will utilize Bayesian methods, specifically JAGS via R with the R package gemtc ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemtc/gemtc.pdf ). To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted sampling simulations and MCMC calculations utilizing a random effects model. We evaluated the convergence diagnostic outcomes using diagnostic plots like trajectory plots and density plots. We determined the means under the random effects model and fixed effects model and inspected homogeneity in the literature using the BlandAltmanLeh package. Homogeneity is deemed good if the distances between all points are within 95% of the LoA. To assess consistency between direct and indirect comparisons, we utilized the node-splitting approach and considered p-values >0.05 to be favorable. If heterogeneity was detected (with I 2 values over 50%), we investigated further heterogeneity and considered the total I 2 .pair and I 2 .cons for the overall results. We also conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time and combining the remaining studies for analysis to assess the potential impact on the outcomes. We calculated the mean surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve for each intervention, where a higher SUCRA indicates a higher rank of the protocol.    2.7. GRADE evidence  The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework methodology was employed to analyze the level of certainty in the evidence for both primary and secondary outcomes. Each aspect of the GRADE framework, including study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, was thoroughly reviewed and evaluated. Additionally, specific considerations related to the network meta-analysis methodology were taken into account. These considerations involved examining indirect comparisons, evaluating the impact of individual direct evidence on the network meta-analysis findings, and assessing the significance of the consistency assumption for the validity of the estimates. [ 13 ]     3. Results   3.1. Search results  A total of 669 studies were retrieved from the preliminary literature search, and no additional 10 studies were identified from a review of citations. After the EndNote software (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, version X7) automatically removed 80 duplicates. A total of 589 records were screened by our teams. Then, 569 papers were excluded due to the reasons. And a total of 20 studies were assessed for eligibility. A total of 7 studies were excluded with reasons. Finally, a total of 13 studies were included for quantitative synthesis (Fig. 1 ). [ 8 , 9 , 11 , 14 \u2013 23 ] The general characteristic of the included studies can be seen in Table 1 . The included studies published from 2004 to 2022. And 2 studies originated from China, 2 studies originated from India. Two studies originated from Iran and USA. One study originated from UK, Australia, and Poland. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 to 12 months. Number of samples ranged from 28 to 189.

A total of 12 studies involving 804 patients, including 9 treatments (atorvastatin, COC, lifestyle, metformin, metformin\u2005+\u2005simvastatin, simvastatin, spironolactone, spironolactone\u2005+\u2005metformin), and placebo contributed to the clinical outcome of the total testosterone level. As displayed in Figure 4 A, the network structure diagrams detailed the direct comparisons between different drugs in the total testosterone level. In head-to-head comparison, atorvastatin (WMD\u2005\u22123.1 [95% CrI: \u22123.7 to\u2005\u22122.5], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ), metformin (WMD\u2005\u22122.6 [95% CrI: \u22123.5 to\u2005\u22121.6], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ), metformin\u2005+\u2005simvastatin (WMD\u2005\u22122.8 [95% CrI: \u22124.1 to\u2005\u22121.5], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ), simvastatin (WMD\u2005\u22122.7 [95% CrI: \u22124.2 to\u2005\u22121.3], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ), spironolactone (WMD\u2005\u22123.1 [95% CrI: \u22124.3 to\u2005\u22121.9], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ), spironolactone\u2005+\u2005metformin(WMD\u2005\u22123.2 [95% CrI: \u22124.5 to\u2005\u22122.0], Fig. 4 B and Table 2 ) were all more effective than the placebo, and the difference was statistically significant.

Discussion  Using network meta-analysis, the study aimed to evaluate the impact of different drugs in reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS. The study compared all available interventions for treating PCOS to provide a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of different treatment in reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS. The results indicated that atorvastatin led to a more significant decrease in testosterone levels compared to other treatments such as COC, simvastatin, spironolactone, simvastatin plus metformin, metformin, lifestyle modifications, spironolactone plus metformin, and placebo.  A previous pair-wise meta-analysis about atorvastatin on the insulin resistance in women of PCOS was done by Chen et al and published in 2021. [ 12 ] In detail, the previous meta-analysis included RCTs for analysis, and showed that atorvastatin therapy can reduce insulin resistance in the treatment of patients with PCOS. Our network meta-analysis suggested that atorvastatin led to a more significant decrease in testosterone levels compared with other treatments. Due to the limitation of traditional pair-wise meta-analysis, a well-designed network meta-analysis may provide more important information for PCOS management.  Previous studies [ 22 , 24 , 25 ] have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using atorvastatin to alleviate PCOS symptoms. One study has demonstrated that the utilization of atorvastatin for over 12 weeks considerably enhanced PCOS symptoms, [ 24 ] although it can negatively affect insulin sensitivity. [ 22 ] However, our study is the first to compare the efficacy of atorvastatin against all available interventions in terms of reducing testosterone levels in patients with PCOS. Initially, we combined atorvastatin and simvastatin as a single group (statins), but this resulted in significant inconsistency ( P <\u2005.05). As a result, we separated atorvastatin and simvastatin into 2 separate groups.  The primary treatment for PCOS is typically COC, as it is effective in resolving symptoms of PCOS. [ 26 ] However, it can also prevent patients from conceiving if desired. Metformin is a potential alternative as the first-line of treatment, as it enables patients to conceive, but it is less effective in addressing PCOS symptoms. [ 26 ] According to the current study, atorvastatin was found to be superior in reducing testosterone levels, which can alleviate PCOS symptoms without impeding the ability to conceive.  Our network meta-analysis has some noteworthy limitations, primarily due to the significant heterogeneity among the studies included. The 9 studies utilized different diagnostic criteria for PCOS, resulting in different types of participants being included. Moreover, various types and dosages of statins were used, which could have impacted the study\u2019s outcomes. The baseline characteristics of the participants, such as age, BMI, and ethnicity, also varied, potentially affecting the results. Additionally, differences in study design, drug dosage, and follow-up duration could have influenced the outcomes. Finally, we only evaluated interventions based on the change in testosterone levels, which may limit the generalizability of the results to patients with high testosterone levels.    5. Conclusions  The results of the present study provide support for the use of atorvastatin over other interventions, as it demonstrated the greatest reduction in total and free testosterone levels. It is important to note that these analyses were conducted using the best available evidence at the time of the study. Therefore, atorvastatin should be cautiously recommended to PCOS patients with high levels of testosterone. However, larger randomized clinical trials are required to identify the most effective atorvastatin dose for patients with PCOS.    Author contributions  Supervision: Xiao-Yu Meng.
