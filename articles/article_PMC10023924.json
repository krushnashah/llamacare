    "abstract": "Vitamin D level is closely associated with the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on patients with PCOS, to provide reliable evidence to the clinical treatment of PCOS. We searched PubMed, Medline, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WanFang, China national knowledge infrastructure(CNKI) and Weipu databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of PCOS. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias of included RCTs. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. 13 RCTs with 840 PCOS patients were included finally. Meta-analyses indicated that vitamin D supplementation increase the serum vitamin D level[mean difference(MD)\u00a0=\u00a017.81, 95% confidence interval(CI) (10.65, 24.97)] and endometrial thickness [MD\u00a0=\u00a01.78, 95%CI (0.49, 3.06), P\u00a0=\u00a00.007], reduce the serum hs-CRP [MD\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.54, 95%CI (\u22121.00, \u22120.08)], parathyroid hormone[MD\u00a0=\u00a0\u221214.76, 95%CI (\u221228.32, \u22121.19)], total cholesterol[MD\u00a0=\u00a0\u221212.00, 95%CI (\u221218.36, \u22125.56)] and total testosterone level [MD\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.17, 95%CI (\u22120.29, \u22120.05)] (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant differences in the SHBG level [MD\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95%CI (\u22122.70, 5.36)] and mF-G score [MD\u00a0=\u00a00.04, 95%CI (\u22120.79, 0.86)] between vitamin D and control group were found (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Egger's tests showed that there were no publication biases in every synthesized result (all P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Vitamin D may be helpful to improve the endocrine and metabolism-related indexes in patients with PCOS. More high-quality studies with larger sample size are warranted to further evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with PCOS.",
    "body": "1  Background  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine diseases in women of reproductive age worldwide. It is defined by a variety of criteria, including menstrual irregularities, androgen excess, and polycystic ovary morphology, as well as common clinical symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, alopecia, menstrual disorders, ovulatory disorders, or infertility [ 1 ]. Hyperandrogenemia, inflammation-related factors and oxidative damage play a important role in the development of PCOS [ 2 ]. The prevalence of PCOS in women of childbearing age worldwide is reported to be different, with an incidence ranging from 5.11% to 16.08% [ 3 , 4 ]. which are related to different races, regions, survey subjects and diagnostic criteria. In recent years, with the increasing prevalence of PCOS, research on its treatment options has become particularly important.  Previous study [ 5 ] have reported that low vitamin D levels may lead to infertility, ovulation disorders, menstrual disorders, and hyperandrogenism. There may be a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and PCOS. It has been reported that [ 6 ] vitamin D deficiency is more common in women with PCOS than women in control group. Besides, vitamin D deficiency may be a contributing factor to IR, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, all of which are commonly found in PCOS patients and are associated with ovulatory dysfunction [ 7 ]. It has been found that vitamin D supplementation will have certain effects on hormones, endocrine level and pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients [ 8 ]. But the findings and conclusions of reported studies are different or even controversial. Therefore, this study systematically evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on PCOS patients, aiming to provide reliable reference for clinical PCOS treatment.    2  Methods  This meta-analysis was conducted and reported in accordance to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) [ 9 ].   2.1  Literature search strategy  Two researchers independently searched PubMed, Medline, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WanFang, China national knowledge infrastructure(CNKI) and Weipu databases to for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) on vitamin D treatment of PCOS. The search terms used in this study were: (\u201cvitamin D\u2033 OR \u201cvitamin D supplementation\u201d OR \u201cvitamin D3\u201d OR \u201cvitamin D2\u201d OR \u201c25-hydroxyvitamin D2\u201d OR \u201c24, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3\u201d OR \u201chydroxycholecalciferol\u201d OR\u201d calcifediol\u201d OR \u201ccalcitriol\u201d OR \u201cdihydrotachysterol\u201d OR \u201crgocalciferol\u201d OR \u201ccholecalciferol\u201d) AND (\u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d OR \u201cPCOS\u201d). The detailed search strategy for PubMed is presented in supplementary file 1. The retrieval time limit is from the establishment of the database to August 31, 2022. In addition, we retroactively included references to the included RCTs to identify the relevant literature. The search was carried out using a combination of subject headings and free words.    2.2  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were as follows: Type of study: RCT design. Study population: Clinically diagnosed patients with PCOS, their nationality, race, body weight, and disease course were not limited. Interventions: Experimental group patients were treated with vitamin D, and the control group were treated with placebo. Corresponding outcome indicators such as hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and endometrial thickness et al. have been reported in the literature. The exclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were: non-Chinese and English literature; duplicate publications; inability to obtain the required data.    2.3  Literature screening and data extration  The identified literature was independently screened, data extracted and cross-checked by two investigators. If there was any disagreement, it would be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third party. In literature screening, the title of the article was read first, and after excluding obviously irrelevant articles, the abstract and full text were further read to determine whether to include or not. If needed, the original corresponding authors were contacted by email or telephone for undetermined but important information. The data extracted in this meta-analysis included: basic information of the included studies, such as the first author, country, etc.; baseline characteristics and intervention measures of the study populations; key elements of risk of bias assessment; vitamin treatment intervention details, relevant outcome indicators, and study conclusions.    2.4  Risk of bias assessment of included studies  The risk of bias assessment of the included RCTs was performed by two investigators using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for RCTs from Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review. Seven specific domains were evaluated: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Every domain in the tool was rated as \u201clow risk\u201d of bias, \u201chigh risk\u201d of bias, or \u201cunclear risk\u201d of bias. All the disagreements were resolved by further discussion and consensus.    2.5  Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. The measurement data used mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as the effect statistic. The heterogeneity among the results of the included studies was analyzed by the Chi-square test (the test level was \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.1), and the size of the heterogeneity was quantitatively judged with I 2 . If there was no statistical heterogeneity among the study results, a fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. If there was a significantly statistical heterogeneity among the study results, the source of heterogeneity was further analyzed and the meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 indicated statistical significance between groups in this meta-analysis.     3  Results   3.1  Literature selection  A total of 196 relevant literatures were obtained in the initial literature search. Finally, 13 RCTs [ [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] ] met the inclusion criteria and were included for meta-analysis. The screening process and results of literature research are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram of study selection. Fig. 1     3.2  Characteristics of included studies and risk of bias assessment  The basic characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1 . Of the included 13 RCTs, a total of 840 PCOS patients were involved, 433 PCOS patients accepted vitamin D intervention, 407 PCOS patients accepted control interventions.

Fig. 7      4  Discussion  PCOS is a common multifactorial disease in women of childbearing age, with diverse clinical manifestations, unknown etiology, complex pathophysiology, and difficult diagnosis [ 23 ]. It's been reported that vitamin D deficiency is common in PCOS patients, up to 85.16% PCOS patients have serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <50\u00a0ng/mL [ 24 ]. Therefore, whether vitamin D supplementation can improve PCOS symptoms has important clinical research value. PCOS patients are often accompanied by reduced or lack of vitamin D levels, and more and more evidences show that vitamin D levels are related to the occurrence, development and outcome of PCOS [ 25 ]. In recent years, people's awareness of the importance of clinical nutrition has continued to increase, and research in this area has also continued to increase, but the results of different studies are controversial. Compared with previous meta-analysis reports [ 26 , 27 ], we included more RCTs and analyzed more related outcome indicators. And we have found that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial to increase the serum vitamin D level and endometrial thickness, reduce the serum hs-CRP, parathyroid hormone, total cholesterol, total testosterone level. No significant differences in the SHBG level and mF-G score between vitamin D and control group are found.  The results of this study show that vitamin D supplementation can significantly reduce the level of the inflammatory marker hs-CRP in PCOS patients. Previous study [ 28 ] has shown that differences in hs-CRP are related to body mass and fat distribution, and are positively correlated with body mass index (BMI). It has reported that lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with higher hs-CRP, lower adiponectin concentrations, and higher BMI and waist circumference, regardless of race [ 29 ]. However, due to hyperandrogenemia, PCOS patients mostly have obesity and lipid accumulation, which leads to increased hs-CRP levels [ 30 ]. Vitamin D supplementation reduces hs-CRP levels, possibly because vitamin D inhibits nuclear transcription factor activity and inflammatory factor production [ 31 ].  We have found that vitamin D supplementation have no effect on SHBG and mF-G scores, other than reducing total testosterone levels. As the most common symptom of PCOS, elevated androgen levels not only lead to hirsutism, acne, obesity and other symptoms, but also may inhibit follicular development, block follicle formation, disrupt the menstrual cycle, and lead to anovulatory infertility [ 32 ]. Vitamin D may be involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones, thereby reducing androgen levels in PCOS patients [ 33 ]. It's been reported that 88% of PCOS patients have high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), which led to the imbalance of estrogen and progesterone secretion, which may affect follicle production and hindered conception [ 34 ]. It's been reported that vitamin D supplementation can significantly reduce LH levels [ 35 ], but this finding needs further verification. Al-Bayyari N\u2032 et al. [ 36 ] has reported that vitamin D 3 at a treatment dose of 50,000 IU per week improved 25(OH)D levels and decreased the hirsutism scores and androgen levels of overweight women with PCOS. We did not include this RCT for analysis because this study only included overweight Jordanian PCOS females aged 18\u201349 years with vitamin D deficiency, which did not meet our inclusion criteria. Besides, Studies have shown that vitamin D receptors are present in multiple tissues of the female reproductive system, such as the ovary, decidua, and placenta. In addition, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D2 directly induced estrogen and progesterone production in cultured human ovarian and placental cells [ 37 ]. Previous study [ 38 ] has shown that for every 1\u00a0ng/mL increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in follicular fluid, the likelihood of clinical pregnancy increases by 6%. The results of this meta-analysis showed that the endometrial thickness of the vitamin D group was higher than that of the placebo group, but because only 2 studies were included and the sample size was small, this finding requires further analysis of related studies with larger samples.  Patients with PCOS are also at increased risk of developing lipid abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms by which vitamin D may affect blood lipid levels are as follows. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secondary to elevated levels of vitamin D, whereas elevated PTH in vivo reduces lipolytic activity [ 39 ]. Supplementing vitamin D can inhibit the body's PTH, so that the synthesis and secretion of PTH are reduced, the lipolytic activity is further enhanced, and the abnormal blood lipid metabolism in the body can be improved [ 40 ]. Besides, vitamin D increases the level of calcium ions in hepatocytes and increases the activity of lipase, thereby reducing serum triglyceride levels [ 41 ]. Furthermore, vitamin D can inhibit the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, thereby resisting adipogenesis and reducing peripheral tissue insulin resistance [ 42 ]. Therefore, vitamin D can improve blood lipid levels in obese PCOS patients, thereby reducing BMI and improving the obesity status of patients. It has found that after vitamin D 3 analog treatment, patients' insulin secretion in the first phase increased and lipid profiles are significantly improved [ 43 ].  There are certain limitations of this meta-analysis and systematic review that deserve consideration. Firstly, the sample sizes of the included studies are quite different, which may cause a certain degree of heterogeneity. Secondly, the outcome indicators of the RCTs included in this meta-analysis are different, and the number of included studies for some outcome indicators is small, and the reliability of the conclusions still needs to be further verified. Thirdly, the quality of included RCTs must be considered. Although randomization, allocation concealment and blinding were reported in the included studies, some of them did not report specific implementation methods, which may have a certain bias. Finally, all the included RCTs are reported from 2013 to 2021 along with potential duration (8\u201324 weeks) and regional or country effects, and some RCTs involve small sample size, which are at high risk of type I and type II errors and may affect further the findings. The role of vitamin D supplementation in PCOS patient needs to be further analyzed and discussed in future large-sample high-quality RCTs.    5  Conclusions  In summary, current evidences show that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial to increase the serum vitamin D level and endometrial thickness, reduce the serum hs-CRP, parathyroid hormone, total cholesterol, total testosterone level in PCOS patients. Limited by the quantity and quality of included studies, those findings need to be further verified by more high-quality studies in the future.
