    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in females that can cause infertility, excessive hair growth, acne, and weight gain. Additionally, women with PCOS are at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, endometrial cancer, and heart problems. Depending on the screening criteria, the global prevalence of PCOS is estimated between 4% to 20% and 6% to 12% of the US female population of reproductive age (13\u201355 years). [ 1 ] The World Health Organization data suggests that approximately 116 million women (3.4%) are affected by PCOS globally. In the modern medical literature, PCOS was first reported in the year 1935 by Stein Leventhal, who described 7 women with amenorrhea, hirsutism, and enlarged cystic ovaries. [ 2 ] PCOS accompanies several metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, obesity, type-II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular risks that directly affect the mental and physical state of the female population who are at their childbearing age. As a multifaceted disorder, PCOS is broadly categorized as a metabolic syndrome or disorder which includes multiple treatment targets. [ 3 , 4 ]  Insulin resistance appeared to be a fundamental disease pathway among PCOS patients. Soon after the recognition of insulin resistance to the pathogenesis of PCOS, it was speculated whether insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin could be useful in the management of the consequences of the condition. [ 5 ] Anecdotal observation suggested that metformin could also be helpful to improve hyperandrogenic symptoms in some cases and might promote weight loss therefore PCOS patients can be treated by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Metformin is one of the longest-established insulin-sensitizing agents used in treating type II diabetes mellitus. However, in the past 2 decades, its properties as an insulin-sensitizing agent have been explored concerning its applicability for women with PCOS. Moreover, metformin was found to have strong activity in inducing ovulation for non-obese women with PCOS and offered advantages over other therapies. Other than inducing ovulation, the use of metformin could also be an effective treatment in restoring female fertility. Typically, metformin is administered for a limited duration to avoid the potential side effects and recurrence associated with the discontinuation if taken for a longer duration. [ 6 ]  In clinical endocrinology, PCOS diagnosis has always remained controversial. In the year 1990, the National Institutes of Health criteria came into existence to create extensive definitions and awareness of PCOS. In the year 2003, the Rotterdam criteria was formulated and required a minimum of 2 conditions out of 3: oligomenorrhea/anovulation, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (\u226512 follicles in each ovary measuring 2\u20139\u2009mm). [ 7 , 8 ] Later, in the year 2006, the Androgen Excess Society revised the criteria for the diagnosis by incorporating the essentiality of the presence of clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism along with oligoanovulation (polycystic ovaries). Yet there are some hurdles in the process of standardizing the diagnosis such as irregular ovulation in early menarche, unavailability of diagnosis by transvaginal ultrasonography, and less awareness of biochemical levels of hyperandrogenism in adolescents. [ 9 ] Lastly, the multi-follicular ovaries which are normally present in adolescent girls are hard to extricate from polycystic ones. Thus, the Pediatric Endocrine Society has recommended certain guidelines for differential diagnosis of PCOS in adults and adolescents. [ 10 \u2013 13 ] Further, approximately 70% of the PCOS population experience hirsutism, a condition where women experience thick, dark, and unwanted hair growth. Also, 15% to 30% of the women diagnosed with PCOS have acne, a less prevalent yet commonly seen symptom of hyperandrogenism. The difference in the prevalence of hirsutism and acne may be due to the difference in the expression of 5\u03b1-reductase in the sebaceous glands and hair follicles, resulting in higher dihydrotestosterone levels in the hair follicle. Of those women presenting with severe acne, over 40% were diagnosed with PCOS. [ 14 , 15 ]  Botanicals and botanical-based nutraceutical supplements are complex interventions enriched with diverse phytoconstituents that act synergistic, antagonist, and rarely agonistic activity within and between compounds. Therapeutic activities in the human body may also demonstrate complexities with simultaneous interaction among the body organs both biochemical and by altering the organ functions. [ 16 ] Kashmir saffron ( Crocus sativus L.) belongs to the family Iridaceae and is cultivated as a food crop known for its labor-intensive harvesting of stigmas from flowers. It is a well-admired and essential food condiment used across the globe. Saffron is also popular folklore and Indian traditional medicine for eye health, skin conditions, digestive ailments, women health, and other ailments. Saffron has shown prominent action against neurodegenerative disorders, namely, Alzheimer (AD), Parkinson disease, dementia, and anxiety due to the presence of bioactive constituents. [ 17 ] Vasegh et al, 2015 reported the effect of a hydroalcoholic extract of saffron on sex hormones in female rats undergoing chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide. The results suggest that crocins ( trans -4-GG-crocin and cis -4-GG-crocin) may act by significantly decreasing serum cholesterol levels by reducing hypophysis-hypothalamus sensitivity to testosterone and subsequently the negative feedback control on Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretion. [ 18 ] Yasmin et al (2019) reported the effect of crocin ( trans -4-GG-crocin) on letrozole-induced PCOS. The results suggest that crocin restored serum-free testosterone levels, and serum FSH and LH levels compared to those in the letrozole-induced PCOS group. Serum estradiol levels were found unaltered compared to those in the control group. [ 19 ]  Network pharmacology is based on the interdisciplinary theory of pharmacology and biology which employs a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as omics, high-throughput screening, and network analysis. It can reveal the complex network relationship between \u201cingredient-gene-target-disease,\u201d which helps to understand the molecular basis of disease from a multi-dimensional approach and predict the potential pharmacological mechanism of drugs. [ 20 ] Herbs\u2019 biological activity is complex, and their effectiveness is dependent on multi-target action via different active components. As a result, they can be investigated based on network pharmacology. With this fact in this study, the quantified apocarotenoids (picrocrocin, safranal) and carotenoids ( trans -4-GG-crocin, trans -3-Gg-crocin, cis -4-GG-crocin, trans -2-gg-crocin, trans -crocetin) of standardized Kashmir saffron ( Crocus sativus L. ) extract (CSE) was retrieved from a recently published article by Girme et al (2021) and explored in the management of PCOS through a network pharmacology approach. [ 21 ] Furthermore, based on the target genes, molecular docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) predictions of apocarotenoids and carotenoids were performed to reveal a mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic profile to exhibit biological effects. The graphical representation of the study is shown in Figure 1 .   Figure 1.   Graphical representation of the study.       2. Materials and methods  Ethical approval was waived or not necessary, and all procedures performed in the studies did not involve human participants or animals.   2.1. Research material  PCOS-related genes were obtained from PCOSKB ( http://pcoskb.bicnirrh.res.in/ ) and Uniprot ( https://www.uniprot.org ) databases, and the PCOS protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the STRING ( https://string-db.org/ ) database. Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to visualize the PPI network, DrugBank ( https://www.drugbank.ca/ ) database was used to search and verify targets, STITCH ( http://stitch.embl.de/ ) database was used to integrate data, and admetSAR 2.0 ( http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/ ) was used to predict ADMET properties of ligands.    2.2. A search of PCOS-related targets and genes  PCOS-related genes were obtained by retrieving data from the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome database (PCOSKB) ( http://pcoskb.bicnirrh.res.in/ ). Information on associated genes, SNPs, diseases, gene ontologies, and pathways was collated and integrated into PCOSKB. Various tools were embedded in the database, such as comorbidity analysis, network analysis, and Venn analysis. [ 22 ] Target matching analysis of PCOS-related genes and CSE constituents was conducted to select the targets for crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal acting on PCOS. The top targets were selected as the main therapeutic targets for CSE.    2.3. Target prediction and validation  Target prediction was used to gain a better understanding of PCOS. DrugBank database was used to confirm relevant targets for identified phytoconstituents. The target protein name of the active component was converted to the standard target gene name using the UniProt Knowledge base. The official symbol was obtained by entering the target protein name into UniProtKB with the organism set to \u201cHomo sapiens.\u201d [ 23 , 24 ]    2.4. Construction of target network and analysis  Target analysis was performed to determine the interaction between the CSE constituents. The relevant targets of PCOS were uploaded against polycystic ovaries to the STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ ). A combined scoring approach was used to generate a PPI network. Cytoscape software was used to visually display and analyze the network structure. Two networks were created: a component-component target network formed by connecting the active components of CSE and their corresponding components, and a core network identified based on the degree of value derived from the component-component target network. The biologically active and UHPLC-PDA quantified carotenoids and apocarotenoids of CSE and the flow diagram of the Cytoscape network protocol are shown in Figure 2 .   Figure 2.   (A) Biologically active quantified carotenoids and apocarotenoids of Crocus sativus L. extract (CSE); (B) Flow diagram of Cytoscape network protocol.       2.5. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis  The DAVID database ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov ), Cytoscape 3.2 software, and R 3.6.3 software were used to perform the GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the targets at P <0.5. The database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) was used to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms that involved biological processes (BP), cell components (CC), and molecular functions (MFs), and visualize genes on KEGG pathway maps. The target of CSE acting on PCOS was inputted into the DAVID database with the organism limited to \u201cHomo sapiens.\u201d [ 25 ]    2.6. Molecular docking   2.6.1. Ligand preparation.  The chemical structure of CSE constituents was converted into 3D before analysis. The 3D structure was later converted from SDF to PDB format using Pymol software and saved in PDB format for docking study. The ligands were subjected to conformational analysis and energy minimization using Monte Carlo conformational search. The lowest energy conformers of all ligands were generated and used for the molecular docking study. [ 26 ]    2.6.2. Protein preparation and molecular docking.  The crystal structures of Rac-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (PDB ID:1UNQ), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (PDB ID:6NJS), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) (PDB ID:4QTB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (PBD ID:4IZ5) were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Polar hydrogen atoms were added to the structure, and Gasteiger-Huckel charges were applied. Missing residues were added during protein preparation. Molecular docking was conducted to generate the best binding affinity or fitness of protein-ligand binding poses. The best ligand binding confirmation of ligands was selected and analyzed using AutoDock 4.2 software and Discovery Studio 4.0. [ 27 , 28 ]     2.7. In silico ADMET Pharmacokinetic prediction of apocarotenoids  The ADMET properties of chemical constituents have a specific role in providing information on how the body reacts to drug/chemical agents to exert their therapeutic effects. In silico ADMET prediction was performed to estimate the pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics of the CSE phytoconstituents. AdmetSAR ( http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/ ) is an accessible online server that predicts ADMET properties such as human intestinal absorption, blood-brain barrier (BBB+) penetration, Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) permeability, biodegradation, AMES (Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay) toxicity, carcinogenicity, and rat acute oral toxicity. Molecular property predicts, Lipinski rule of 5, was used to evaluate drug-likeness and/or determine whether a chemical constituent with a particular pharmacological or biological activity would make it an orally active drug like moiety for humans. Molinspiration ( www.molinspiration.com ) software was used to determine the fundamental and molecular properties of these apocarotenoids, such as hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, molecular weight, and lipophilicity. [ 29 ]     3. Results   3.1. Identification and quantitative analysis of a stigma-based botanical extract of Crocus sativus L. (CSE)  Seven phytoconstituents namely picrocrocin, trans -4-GG-crocin, trans -3-Gg-crocin, cis -4-GG-crocin, trans -2-gg-crocin, trans -crocetin (crocetin), and safranal, were identified in the CSE. [ 21 ] These constituents were screened according to the standard screening conditions (OB\u2005>\u200550% and DL\u2005>\u20050.15). The chemical properties of the phytoconstituents of Crocus sativus extract (CSE) are depicted in Table 1 .   Table 1   Chemical properties of the phytoconstituents of Crocus sativus extract .

Identification of targets for PCOS  By searching the above-mentioned databases, fifty nine PCOS targets were retrieved. The targets of PCOS from the PCOSKB database are depicted in Table 2 and shown in Figure 3 . The 6 active ingredients of CSE and serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), STAT3, MAPK3, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) genes were used to construct a network to present the relationship between CSE components and therapeutic targets against PCOS. The result suggests that AKT1, STAT3, MAPK3, and MAPK1 are responsible for the management of PCOS. These four proteins were collected from the STRING database and checked UniProt-ID for the same. Finally, an open protein network in the Cytoscape was used for network analysis.   Table 2   Targets of PCOS from PCOSKB database.      Sr. No  Symbol  Name of Target      1.

Network construction and analysis   3.3.1. PPI network and active ingredient-target-disease network.  A PPI network was constructed as per protein interaction. Four major protein nodes and interaction lines were identified for the carotenoids and apocarotenoids of CSE. Six out of 7 constituents of CSE and 4 major proteins were used to construct the network to establish the relationship between carotenoids and the target proteins of PCOS.    3.3.2. UniProtKB of AKT1, STAT3, MAPK3, MAPK1.  The target protein name of the active ingredient was converted to the standard target gene name using the UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB). UniProt KB is the central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent, and rich annotation. The target protein names were uploaded into UniProtKB, with the organism restricted to \u201cHomo sapiens,\u201d eventually gaining the official symbol. The potential targets obtained from the UniproKB are depicted in Figures 3 and 4 .   Figure 4.

AKT1 = serine/threonine kinase 1, MAPK1 = mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, MAPK3 = mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome, STAT3 = signal transducer and activator of transcription.        3.4. GO function enrichment analysis  The Cytoscape 3.7.2 software and R 3.6.3 software were used to analyze the potential targets of CSE against PCOS using GO annotation analysis. Fifty nine PCOS annotation nodes were identified using the GO database. The top 4 pathways were determined mainly including pathways in Apoptosis- Homo sapiens (hsa01524), ErbB signaling pathway Homo sapiens- (hsa04012), FoXO signaling pathway Homo sapiens (hsa04722), mTOR signaling pathway Homo sapiens (hsa04150). Four enriched GO terms with false discovery rate P <0.03 to 0.05 were established. Among these GO terms, 20 biological processes (Fig. 5 ), 20 cellular components (Fig. 6 ), and 20 molecular functions (Fig. 7 ) were determined.   Figure 5.

The X-axis shows the fold enrichment of target genes, and the Y-axis shows the significantly enriched GO categories of the target genes (false discovery rate P <0.05).    3.5. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis  Cytoscape 3.7.2 software and R 3.6.3 software were used to analyze the potential targets of CSE against PCOS using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The Y-axis represents the significant pathway of the target genes, and the X-axis shows the enrichment factor. The enrichment factor represents the ratio of the number of target genes belonging to a pathway to the total number of all annotated genes located in the pathway. A higher enrichment factor represents a higher enrichment level. The color of the dot corresponds to different P values, and the size of the dot reflects the number of target genes expressed in the pathway. Figure 8 shows a dot plot of the entries in the KEGG enrichment pathway. Foremost identified KEGG enrichment pathways for AKT1 homo sapiens pathway which included EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance (hsa01521), Endocrine resistance (hsa01522), Platinum drug resistance (hsa01524), MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010), ErbB signaling pathway (hsa04012), FoxO signaling pathway (hsa04068), Sphingolipid signaling pathway (hsa04071), phospholipase D signaling pathway (hsa04072), autophagy\u2014animal (hsa04140), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (hsa04151) and mTOR signaling pathway (hsa04150).

Molecular docking  Network analysis of different phytoconstituents that could benefit from PCOS was conducted using an active ingredient-target-disease-based approach. Four proteins were docked with the 6 major constituents of CSE using AutoDock Vina and the best confirmation of these constituent-target complexes was obtained. The major targets are AKT1, MAPK3, STAT3, and MAPK1. The docking score of all 6 CSE phytoconstituents against the identified targets is shown in Table 3 .

The docking score is proportional to the matching binding energy which indicates higher stability and stronger interactions in the ligand-receptor complex. Docking simulations of candidate ligands namely, trans -3-Gg-crocin, trans -2-gg-crocin, picrocrocin, cis -3-Gg-crocin, trans -crocetin, and safranal were performed at the active site of Rac-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase. Here, crocetin showed prominent interactions with ARG25, ASN53, and ARG23 amino acids via H-Bond, and LEU52 amino acid through Pi-alkyl interaction with a docking score of \u22125.32 kcal/mol, Consequently, picrocrocin showed prominent interactions with LEU52 (H-bond), ASN54 (H-bond), ASN53 (C-H bond), and ARG23 (C-H bond) amino acid residues with a docking score of \u22124.85 kcal/mol and safranal exhibits docking score of \u22124.73 kcal/mol and interacts with LEU52 (H-bond), LYS39 (H-bond), PRO42 (Pi-alkyl), and TYR38 (Pi-alkyl) amino acid residues. It was observed that crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal have a prominent interaction whereas, the other ligands namely, trans -3-Gg-crocin (\u22121.16 kcal/mol), trans -2-gg-crocin (\u22122.93 kcal/mol), cis -3-gg-crocin (\u22121.17 kcal/mol) possess lower docking score. The potential 2D interaction of the apocarotenoids and carotenoids of CSE at the active site of (Rac-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase) AKT1 is shown in Figure 9 .   Figure 9.

Docking simulations of candidate ligands at the active site of the protein (STAT3) showed that picrocrocin had the highest docking score of \u22124.97 kcal/mol followed by prominent interactions with SER513 (H-bond), SER514 (H-bond), GLY253 (H-bond), GLY254 (C-H bond), TRP510 (C-H bond), PRO256 (Pi-alkyl), ASP334 (C-H bond), and PRO 336 (Pi-alkyl) amino acids. Whereas, crocetin showed a docking score of \u22124.47 kcal/mol and interacted with LYS488 (H-bond), ARG379 (H-bond), SER381 (H-bond), LEU438 (Pi-alkyl), LYS370 (Pi-alkyl), VAL490 (Pi-alkyl), and HIS457 (Pi-alkyl) amino acids. In line with the picrocrocin and crocetin, safranal interacted with the PRO675 (C-H bond), MET586 (Pi-alkyl), TYR674 (Pi-alkyl), ILE677 (Pi-alkyl), LEU:673 (Pi-alkyl), and TYR584 (Pi-alkyl) amino acid residues with a docking score of \u22124.40 kcal/mol. Other ligand complex also possesses the lowest docking score such as trans -3-gg-crocin (-2.07 kcal/mol), trans -2-gg-crocin (\u22124.26 kcal/mol), and Cis -3-gg-crocin (1.76 kcal/mol) respectively. The docking (2D) interaction of apocarotenoids and carotenoids at the active site of the STAT3 receptor is shown in Figure 10 .   Figure 10.

In silico ADMET prediction of apcarotenoids and carotenoids of stigma-based CSE  The molecular descriptors of the constituents were evaluated according to Lipinski rule of 5. The molecular weight of the chemical entity plays an essential role in identifying the absorptivity and efficacy of the compound and is directly related to its surface area. The molecular weights of these apocarotenoids and carotenoids range from 150 to 1000 gm/mol. Crocins have a molecular weight of\u2005>500 gm/mol, whereas crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal have a molecular weight of\u2005<500 gm/mol. The lipophilicity and the total surface area occupied by the bonds (known as the topological surface area) are 2 essential factors that affect the penetrability of the compound across the biological membrane. TPSA values\u2005\u2264140 and\u2005\u226410 \u00c5 of the rotational bonds are considered more bioavailable due to the flexibility of the rotational bond to interact in rigid areas. The lipophilic nature of these compounds was identified using the Molinspiration software (Table 4 ).   Table 4   In silico ADMET prediction of standardized Crocus sativus extract constituents.

absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity.     The absorption pattern and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of a chemical entity are essential characteristics widely used to determine how the body reacts with the ingested drug molecule. Therefore, admetSAR 2.0 was used to determine the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of apocarotenoids and carotenoids, such as membrane permeability, AMES toxicity, Caco-2 permeation, blood-brain barrier permeability, human intestinal absorption, and renal organic cation transport parameters. All 7 major phytoconstituents of CSE were screened to predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters. Out of these 7 bioactive compounds 3 of them namely, picrocrocin, crocetin, and safranal were found to have the maximum bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeation. Except for picrocrocin, all other compounds were found to be capable of penetrating the Caco-2 membrane. The metabolic process of a living organism plays an important role in maintaining the process of converting the drug molecules into a more soluble form to accelerate the excretion process. Cytochrome enzymes are the building blocks for the metabolic process which is involved in the drug-drug or herb-drug interactions by activation/inhibition of CYP enzymes. The possibility of drug accumulation and toxicity is increased by the inhibition or activation of these enzymes. These apocarotenoids and carotenoids could act as substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 enzymes, and inhibit the CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes. A non-inhibitor of CYP450 indicates that the molecule does not hamper the biotransformation of drugs metabolized by CYP450. P-glycoproteins are the major reason for drug resistance or make the cells less susceptible to drugs. They are mainly involved in the efflux and activation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which increases the efflux of the drug and creates drug concentration below the minimum required concentrations which may lead to therapeutic failures. Interestingly, all 7 quantified constituents of CSE were non-inhibitors of P-glycoproteins. Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are directly or indirectly correlated with the molecular properties of these compounds. All constituents were found non-AMES toxic. Furthermore, the constituents were found to be non-carcinogenic, and acute oral toxicity prediction revealed that these phytoconstituents were safe and belonged to toxicity class III. Pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 4 .     4. Discussion  Saffron stigma extract contains different chemical constituents, including crocin, picrocrocin, crocetin, and safranal. Therefore, a network pharmacology approach was used to explore the potential targets, therapeutic effects, and possible mechanisms of action of CSE in the management of PCOS. In this study, 7 phytoconstituents, trans -4-GG-crocin, trans -3-Gg-crocin, cis -4-GG-crocin, trans -2-Gg-crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal were used to establish a network of all the potential therapeutic targets underlying PCOS. In terms of therapeutic activity, 4 major targets were obtained, by which saffron extract acts as a preventive supplement against PCOS. In the present study, we demonstrated the PPI network, GO, and KEGG enrichment pathways to establish a deep understanding of the potential mechanism of CSE phytoconstituents in PCOS. A thorough investigation of CSE phytoconstituents could be effective in the prevention of PCOS. This botanical supplement has been thoroughly explored for several aspects, such as authentication of the raw material and qualitative and quantitative estimation of the chemical constituents present in the raw material and extract. Owing to its medicinal potential, Crocus sativus L. stigma is part of over 200 formulations in 'Ayurveda', 'Siddha' and 'Unani' medicines used in treatment. Traditionally, it has multiple pharmacological actions that have been validated by numerous clinical studies for its stress, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and aphrodisiac properties. The pleiotropic effect of standardized stigma-based Crocus sativus L. extract is shown in Figure 13 . Another common and prominent use of saffron includes its aphrodisiac properties consumed with sugar candy, which imparts effects on sexual vigor, lack of libido, and erectile dysfunction. [ 30 \u2013 33 ]   Figure 13.   Pleiotropic effect of standardized stigma-based Crocus sativus extract.     A recent study report presented by Fazeleh Moshfegh et al (2022) reported the effects of saffron petal extract and saffron petal anthocyanins on ovarian hormones, steroidogenic enzymes, ovarian dysfunction, regulation of anti-inflammatory genes, and antioxidant factors in female having PCOS. These results suggest that saffron petal extract and saffron petal anthocyanins ameliorate the symptoms of PCOS by improving the dysregulation of ovarian steroids, steroidogenic, antioxidant enzymes, and inflammatory markers in PCOS mice. [ 34 ] Consequently, Eid et al, (2019), studied the effect of crocin on Letrozole-induced PCOS in female rats. In clinical studies, Rahmani et al (2019) reported that saffron provides a protective effect on several biochemical parameters like HOMA (Homeostatic Model Assessment), FBG (Fasting Blood Glucose), IR (Insulin Resistance), and inflammatory levels in women with PCOS Further, Mohaqiq et al (2020) reported the antioxidant properties of the saffron stigma and petals and established a potential therapeutic approach for insulin resistance through an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine in high-calorie diet rats. [ 35 , 36 ] The pathogenesis of PCOS is shown in Figure 14 .   Figure 14.   Pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome.     PPI network analysis showed compact interactions of saffron apocarotenoids and carotenoids with several targets. In compliance with the degree ranking of the targets, constituents act on the 4 most promising targets of PCOS-related genes, namely AKT1, STAT3, MAPK3, and MAPK1. The 4 targets, namely AKT1 (Rac-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase), STAT3, MAPK3, MAPK1, may play a crucial role in the PCOS network of Crocus sativus L.  AKT1 gene is responsible for providing instructions to produce a protein called AKT1 kinase, which is found in various types of cells and is involved as a key protein in many signaling pathways. [ 37 ] AKT1 kinase helps to regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation) and cell survival. It also helps to control apoptosis, which is the self-destruction of cells when they become damaged or are no longer needed. However, the signal involving AKT1 kinase appears to be essential for the normal development and function of the nervous system. [ 38 ] Studies have suggested a role for AKT1 kinase in cell-to-cell communication among nerve cells (neurons), neuronal survival, and the formation of memories. [ 39 ] AKT kinase is one of the 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3). It regulates glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface. This gene plays an important role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the time of the process of newborn neuron integration during adult neurogenesis, which includes the correct neuron positioning, dendritic development, and synapse formation. Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin and insulin-like growth factor I. Recently, PIK3 kinase has been recognized to have a specific role in PCOS as the PIK3-AKT signaling pathway activated by insulin has a specific role in the regulation of metabolism and controlling cell growth and differentiation. [ 40 , 41 ] Rivero et al employed human endometrial stromal cells from PCOS with IR that had been immortalized by telomerase and found that the levels of the proteins Munc18c and phosphor-PKCz reduced when the cells were stimulated with insulin. It suggested that the PI3KAkt signaling pathway was connected to insulin. The pathophysiology of PCOS, including IR, fat cell differentiation syndrome, and the development of ovarian follicles, is significantly influenced by PIK3. [ 40 ] The present study probably supports the hypothesis that saffron constituents could be helpful in PCOS by regulating metabolic activity and insulin sensitization in women with symptoms of PCOS.  The STAT3 is a transcription factor encoded by the STAT3 gene in humans. It is a member of the STAT protein family. These genes provide instructions for generating proteins that are part of the essential chemical signaling pathways within cells. [ 42 ] However, when STAT proteins are activated by certain chemical signals, they move into the cell nucleus and bind to areas of DNA. STAT proteins bind to the regulatory regions near genes, which allows the proteins to control whether these genes are turned on or off. However, the STAT proteins are known as transcription factors based on their action. STAT3 is involved in many cellular functions through the regulation of gene activity. Moreover, it is involved in the control of cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and cell self-destruction (apoptosis). STAT3 protein transmits signals for the maturation of immune system cells, especially T cells and B cells in the immune system. [ 43 ] These cells help control the body response to foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. In addition, the protein involved in the regulation of inflammation is one way the immune system responds to infection or injury and plays a role in cellular processes that promote allergic reactions. [ 44 , 45 ] It is previously known that women with PCOS have an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcomes (e.g., restricted or accelerated fetal growth), indicating placental dysfunction. Placental STAT3 and mTOR pathways regulate placental function and indirectly affect fetal growth. Studies suggest that STAT3 has a diverse and significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Victorin et al, (2015) presented a report discussing the activation of placental STAT3 signaling in women with PCOS. [ 46 ] In the same series, several studies have been conducted stating the role of STAT3 signaling pathways in PCOS. [ 47 , 48 ] In our study, picrocrocin, crocetin, and safranal have shown a specific binding affinity towards the STAT3 kinase pathways and could be the target components that present preventive effects in PCOS.  MAPK3, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases, act in a signaling cascade that regulates various cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression in response to a variety of extracellular signals. This protein kinase is activated by upstream kinases, resulting in its translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. The MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is associated with steroid biosynthesis in ovarian granulosa cells. [ 49 , 50 ] Aberrant MAPK/ERK signaling contributes to metabolic signaling defects and excessive ovarian androgen production in women with PCOS. [ 51 , 52 ] In our study, we have evaluated the effect of CSE phytoconstituents on MAP kinases. The results suggest that the potential binding of picrocrocin and crocetin could present significant activity in patients with PCOS.  Considering all the facts and substantial basis for understanding the role of selected biological targets to which the apocarotenoids and carotenoids showed the best binding affinities were selected by molecular docking simulations. The network pharmacology and in silico molecular docking study of the PCOS receptor-ligand complex could be a potential approach for designing effective and targeted therapeutic interventions that can prevail over critical health concerns. The analysis revealed that 3 constituents represent to be the ideal candidates for PCOS and could present a significant effect in managing the diseased state. Nonetheless, the current study revealed enough mechanistic evidence of apocarotenoids and carotenoids to investigate how these constituents work on distinct PCOS targets and might show the efficacy of the CSE in PCOS. More data (preclinical and clinical trials) are needed to assess the efficacy of the standardized botanical-based Crocus sativus extract supplement in the treatment of PCOS.    5. Conclusions  Crocus sativus L. (saffron), a well-known spice and food condiment, is a versatile botanical supplement due to phytoconstituents and their pleiotropic effects. Traditionally, saffron has been used in the management of several biological ailments, supported by modern and scientific data. In the present study, apocarotenoids and carotenoids quantified in CSE were thoroughly screened to determine potential targets involved in the management of PCOS using a network pharmacological approach. Furthermore, in the PPI and network analysis, 4 prominent targets namely, AKT1, MAPK1, MAPK3, and STAT3, were identified. A molecular docking simulation study was performed between the identified targets and carotenoids and apocarotenoids. Safranal, picrocrocin, and crocetin showed potential interactions with Rac-alpha serine/threonine kinase (AKT1) and could potentially inhibit the STAT3 signaling pathway which may have a potential action toward insulin resistance and follicular development of the placenta typically associated with PCOS. Picrocrocin and crocetin present a potent interaction against the MAP kinase pathway and can be potential candidates in the management of metabolic disorders.
