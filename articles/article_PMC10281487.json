    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disease in women of\nchildbearing age, affecting 6%\u201313% of females worldwide. 1  \u2013 4 It has diverse clinical\nmanifestations as it is a heterogeneous syndrome of systemic\nneuro-endocrine-metabolic network disorders.  5  The main symptoms are ovulatory and menstrual with high androgen levels,\ndepression, and other mood disturbances. 6 , 7 Some studies have shown that\nPCOS is a lifelong metabolic disorder with evidence of the increased prevalence of\ninsulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiometabolic disease, and endometrial\ncancer. 8 \u2013 10 Therefore,\nearly screening of PCOS is essential to treat the disease and prevent its long-term\ncomplications. Currently, the diagnosis of the syndrome relies on ultrasonography\nand serology. Since the results of these methods are related to the women's\nmenstrual cycle, and there are strict requirements on the detection time, the degree\nof patient cooperation is low. Tongue and pulse diagnoses in Traditional Chinese\nMedicine (TCM) are convenient and noninvasive detection methods that provide\nobjective reference indicators for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\nTherefore, it is necessary to establish a PCOS risk prediction model based on tongue\nand pulse diagnosis data.  Tongue diagnosis and pulse diagnosis are essential components of TCM diagnosis.\nDoctors infer the occurrence and development of the disease by observing the tongue,\ntongue coating, and pulse. With the development of computer technology, many studies\nhave been carried out on the acquisition and simulation of TCM pulse and tongue\ndiagnoses. Current research determined that tongue and pulse are closely related to\ndigestive, endocrine, and circulatory diseases. 11 \u2013 13 There is also progress in\nfemale tongue and pulse research. Hsieh et al.  14  found differences in tongue color during the menstrual cycle in women.\nAnother study suggested that there was a close relationship between the performance\nof the tongue and pulse in women and the incidence of coronary heart disease.  15  Thus, tongue and pulse conditions could be used to assess the physical\ncondition of women.  Machine learning, a broad branch of artificial intelligence, is a multifield\ninterdisciplinary subject involving probability theory, statistics, and computer\nscience, and is widely used in various fields. The application of machine learning\nin clinical medicine simplifies the decision-making for doctors. Rubio et al.  16  used the logic model as a decision support system in the clinic, where the\nalgorithm provided a decision analysis of the care trajectories of patients.\nArtificial intelligence and statistical analysis can be applied to identify and\npredict medical patterns from the extensive data of patients, and machine learning\nalgorithms can be used to predict certain diseases based on tongue and pulse data.\nLi et al.  17  used the Stacking and ResNet50 models to predict type 2 diabetes based on\ntongue images. Shi et al.  18  used the neural network to establish a model for fatigue classification based\non tongue and pulse data. Zhang et al.  19  proposed a Bayesian network-based classification system to diagnose cor\npulmonale, appendicitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, and bronchitis.  The present study aimed to establish a noninvasive and convenient PCOS prediction\nmodel and evaluate the ability of tongue and pulse parameters combined to predict\nPCOS risk. This study used different machine learning to determine the accurate\nestimated scores for PCOS predictions by the proposed independent risk factors.    Material and methods   Study subjects  This retrospective study used a dataset of 285 patients diagnosed with PCOS. Data\nwere collected from The Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with the Shanghai\nUniversity of TCM, China. All patients were evaluated according to the 2003\nRotterdam diagnostic criteria.  20  We also enrolled 201 healthy female volunteers who comprised the control\ngroup in the Physical Examination Center of the hospital. The study followed the\nethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration of Good Clinical Practice\nGuidelines. All participants signed informed consent, and the study was approved\nby the Medical Ethics Committee of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai\nUniversity of TCM (authorization no. 2018-626-55-01).    Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria  Inclusion criteria were as follows (2/3 should be fulfilled): The 2003 Rotterdam\ndiagnostic criteria  20  were as follows: Oligo- and/or anovulation; Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; Polycystic ovaries. Exclusion criteria were as follows: Cases that did not meet the inclusion criteria of this project; Hyperandrogenism is caused by other causes, such as congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, and androgen-secreting\ntumors; Other causes of ovulation disorders, such as hyperprolactinemia,\npremature ovarian failure, pituitary or hypothalamic amenorrhea, and\nabnormal thyroid function; Patients had taken hormonal medications (such as contraceptives,\novulation stimulants, and glucocorticoids) within the past\nmonth; Patients with underlying severe diseases in internal medicine and\nsurgery; Patients who were unable to cooperate with completing the study plan,\nincluding those with a history of infectious diseases, mental\ndisorders, and other medical records.    Clinical tongue and pulse data collection and analysis method   Tongue and pulse data collection  Tongue and pulse diagnosis data were collected using the TDA-1 tongue\ndiagnosis instrument and PDA-1 pulse diagnosis instrument developed by the\nShanghai University of TCM Intelligent Diagnosis Technology Research Team.\nThe collection process was operated by Professional researchers from\nShuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of TCM. Before tongue\ndata collection, the staff used alcohol cotton balls to wipe the instrument\nfor disinfection and confirmed that the examinee had an empty stomach, a\nclean mouth, and no foreign matter or stained coating on the tongue. The\nsubjects took the sitting position, put the mandible on the mandible rest,\nopened the mouth, and stretched the tongue to fully expose the tongue\nsurface. The tongue body was relaxed, and the tongue surface was flat and\nstretched.  Before pulse data collection, the subjects were required to ensure that they\ndid not stay up late, and did not drink strong tea or coffee. The subjects\nwere breathing calmly, sitting upright, with the upper arms relaxed, and the\nelbows bent about 120\u00b0. The forearms were naturally flat, the wrists were\nplaced on the pulse pillow, and the palms were facing up. The PDA-1\nsingle-segment pulse detector was placed in the sampler where the subject's\npulse was most obvious, and it could automatically collect a single-part\npulse diagram with a stable waveform of 30\u2005s.    Tongue and pulse data analysis method  Tongue data were analyzed using the Tongue Diagnosis Analysis System (TDAS)\ndeveloped by the same team. The data of tongue images were selected from the\nindexes of the CIE-Lab color space. Tongue body L value (TB-L) and tongue\ncoating L value (TC-L) represented the lightness of 0\u2013100, indicating the\nrange from pure black to pure white. Tongue body a value (TB-a) and tongue\ncoating a value (TC-a) represented the green-red axis, while the positive a\nrepresented red, and the negative a represented green. Tongue body b value\n(TB-b) and tongue coating b value (TC-b) represented the blue-yellow axis,\nwhile the positive b represented yellow, and the negative b represented blue.  18  Pulse data were analyzed by the pulse classification standard in\n\u201cModern TCM Pulse Diagnosis.\u201d  21  The specific parameters are defined in Supplemental Table 1 .     Variable selection  Variable selection plays a critical role in machine learning and hence is used in\nmodel-building for simplifying, facilitating interpretation, and eliminating\nredundant variables.  22  The present study used Propensity Score Matching (PSM)  23  to accurately match the experimental and control groups\u2019 age variables\nand eliminate selection bias. The minor absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression  24  was used for variable screening in this study; nonetheless, the sample\nsize was small.    Statistical analysis  SPSS 26.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Continuous data with normal\ndistribution were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD), and those with\nabnormal distribution were represented as the median and interquartile range\n(IQR). IQR was equal to the third quartile minus the first quartile. The\ncomparisons between groups were conducted using a t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U -test for continuous variables. In this study, the\naccuracy of the proposed prediction models was calculated using the area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Then, the accuracy,\nsensitivity, and specificity were calculated. The DeLong test was performed to\nexamine the differences between the ROC curves of various machine learning\nclassifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) was directly compared in a pairwise\napproach using paired DeLong test.  25  P <\u20090.05 (two-tailed) indicated a statistically\nsignificant difference in the comparisons when the inspection level was\n\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. A calibration curve was used to evaluate the model performance. In\naddition, decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the clinical benefit\nof the models. It was a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic\nand prognostic strategies that exhibited advantages over other commonly used\nmeasures and techniques.  26     Machine learning approach  In this study, three machine learning classification algorithms were used to\nestablish a PCOS risk prediction model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier,\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier, and Support Vector Machine\n(SVM). Each algorithm incorporates tongue and pulse parameters to build models\nand make two-class predictions, respectively. MLP is a feedforward artificial\nneural network consisting of three layers: an input layer, one or more hidden\nlayers, and an output layer.  27  XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosting decision trees focused\non computational speed and model performance. It achieves the best results by\nadding multiple decision trees.  28  SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which proves simpler in\nstructure and offers global optimality and good generalization; hence, it has\nbeen widely applied in classification. 29 \u2013 31 The selection of\npatients\u2019 tongue and pulse feature parameters and model classification are shown\nin Figure 1 . All\nmachine learning processes were carried out using Python 3.7.   Figure 1.   Overall flowchart.        Results   Baseline statistics  The dataset included 486 subjects (285 PCOS patients and 201 healthy women) aged\n20\u201344 years. The height, weight, BMI, and age of women in the healthy group and\nthe PCOS group do not conform to the normal distribution, so the relevant data\nare represented by median (IQR). The height of the subjects in the healthy group\nwas 1.640\u2005m (0.080), the height of the subjects in the PCOS group was 1.620\n(0.030) m; the weight of the subjects in the healthy group was 61.000 (9.200)\nkg, the weight of the subjects in the PCOS group was 62.100 (8.800) kg; the BMI\nof the subjects in the healthy group was 22 .684 (2.534) kg/m 2 , PCOS\ngroup subjects BMI was 24.221 (2.384) kg/m 2 . There were differences\nin height, weight, and BMI between the two groups of subjects\n( P <\u20090.05). In addition, the age of subjects in the\nhealthy group was 28.000 (5.000) years old, and the age of subjects in the PCOS\ngroup was 31.000 (6.000) years old. There was a statistical difference in age\nbetween the two groups ( P <\u20090.05). The baseline\ncharacteristics of the included subjects are listed in Table 1 .   Table 1.

In order to exclude the interference of age differences in this study, we used\nPSM to take the occurrence of PCOS as the outcome, together with the age of the\ntwo groups of subjects as the scoring item in a ratio of 1:1. The corrected\nbaseline data was obtained after accurate matching. After PSM matching, the age\nof the subjects in the healthy group was 28.000 (5.000) years old, and the age\nof the subjects in the PCOS group was 28.000 (5.000) years old. There was no\nstatistical difference in the ages of the two groups of subjects\n( P >\u20090.05), which met the research requirements. After\nmatching, the height of the subjects in the healthy group was 1.640 (0.080) m,\nthe height of the subjects in the PCOS group was 1.620 (0.030) m; the weight of\nthe subjects in the healthy group was 61.000 (9.200) kg, and the weight of the\nsubjects in the PCOS group was 62.400 (7.900) kg; The BMI of the subjects in the\nPCOS group was 22.684 (2.534) kg/m 2 , and the BMI of the subjects in\nthe PCOS group was 24.221 (2.360) kg/m 2 . There were still differences\nin height, weight, and BMI between the two groups\n( P <\u20090.05). The baseline data of the two groups after\nmatching are shown in Table 2 .   Table 2.

Data analysis of tongue and pulse  The tongue and pulse data of women in the healthy group and the PCOS group do not\nconform to the normal distribution, so the relevant data are represented by the\nmedian (IQR). The clinical tongue and pulse data of the subjects are shown in Table 3 . It can\nbe seen from Table\n3 that in terms of tongue coating in the PCOS group: the TC-L value\nand TC-a value were significantly lower than those of the healthy group. PCOS\ngroup's TC-b value was significantly higher than that of the healthy group. In\nterms of tongue quality in the PCOS group: the TB-L value and The TB-a value\nwere significantly lower than those of the healthy group. The TB-b value of the\nPCOS group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group. The\ndifferences in the above tongue data were statistically significant\n( P <\u20090.05). In addition, in terms of pulse data,\nt 1 /t, h 4 /h 1 in the PCOS group were\nsignificantly higher than those in the healthy group, and\nh 1 /t 1 , h 3 /h 1 , t, t 4 ,\nt 5 , h 1 , h 3 , h 4 , and\nh 5 were significantly lower than those in the healthy group.\nAlso, significant differences were detected in the above pulse data\n( P <\u20090.05).

Variable filter  The \u201cGlmnet\u201d package (version 4.1.2) was applied to fit the logistic LASSO\nregression. Feature selection was performed using Lasso, and the Lasso model's\ntuning parameter (\u03bb) was selected by a minimum criterion using 10-fold\ncross-validation. BMI, tongue data, and pulse data were included in the variable\nselection dataset. AUROC versus log(\u03bb) was plotted. Vertical dashed lines were\ndrawn at the optimal values with the logarithm \u03bb of the minimum mean squared\nerror and the logarithm \u03bb of the standard error of the minimum distance ( Figure 2A and B ).\nAccording to 10-fold cross-validation, the \u03bb of the minimum mean squared error\nwas 0.006, and the variable selection of the corresponding model was\nTB-L\u2009+\u2009TB-a\u2009+\u2009TB-b\u2009+\u2009TC-L\u2009+\u2009TC-a\u2009+\u2009h 3 +\u2009h 4 /h 1 .\nThus, a PCOS risk prediction model was established using these seven variables\nas independent factors.   Figure 2.   Tongue and pulse features selection using the LASSO binary logistic\nregression model. (A) The LASSO model's tuning parameter (\u03bb) was chosen\nto satisfy the minimum criteria using ten-fold cross-validation. The AUC\ncurve versus log(\u03bb) was plotted. The two vertical dashed lines in the\ngraph represent the logarithm \u03bb of the minimum mean squared error (left\ndashed line, \u03bb\u2009=\u20090.006) and the logarithm \u03bb of the standard error of the\nminimum distance (right dashed line, \u03bb\u2009=\u20090.02). (B) LASSO coefficient\nprofiles of the 21 tongue and pulse features and BMI baseline\ncharacteristics. A coefficient profile plot was produced against the\nlog(\u03bb) sequence. A vertical line was drawn at the value selected using\nthe minimum mean squared error, where optimal \u03bb resulted in seven\nnonzero coefficients.    LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; AUC: area under\nthe curve; BMI: body mass index.     Machine learning model evaluation  In the PCOS and healthy female subgroups, the characteristic parameters of tongue\nand pulse data obtained by screening were used to establish a PCOS prediction\nmodel based on four machine learning classifiers: MLP, XGBoost, and SVM. The ROC\nmean and SD of each model were calculated by repeated sampling; the selection\nwas ten times. The validation set of each resampling training accounted for 20%\nof the total sample, and the training set accounted for 80%, indicating that\neach group was selected as the test set in turn to ensure that the evaluation\nresults were not accidental. Then, the ten evaluation results were averaged to\nreduce the errors due to unreasonable choices in the test set. The DeLong test\nwas performed to examine the differences between the ROC curves of different\nmachine learning classifiers, and its clinical application was explored by\nDCA.  The parameters of the MLP classifier model were as follows: activation selected\nrelu, the hidden layer width was (12, 12), and the number of iterations was 100.\nThe specific parameters of the XGBoost classifier model were as follows: the\noptimized objective function was binary logistic, the learning rate was 0.002,\nthe max depth was 10, the minimum child weight was 10, and the regularized\ncoefficient was 1. The SVM model parameters were as follows: the regularization\nfactor was 0.1, the kernel type was sigmoid, and the convergence metric was set\nto 0.01. The training and test set results of the four model classifications are\nsummarized in Tables\n4 and 5 .   Table 4.

The machine learning ROC curve graphs are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . The AUCs of the three machine\nlearning models were\u2009>\u20090.9, indicating high predictive values. Then, the\nDeLong test was performed on the ROC curves of the three machine learning\nmethods. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the\nROC curves of the above machine learning models ( P >\u20090.05)\n( Table 6 ). The\ncalibration curves for the validation sets of multiple models ( Figure 5 ) showed that,\nexcept for the XGBoost model, the predicted probabilities of the other machine\nclassification models were close to the true probabilities. Moreover, the SVM\nmodel was closer to the reference value of the diagonal. Subsequently, we used\nDCA to assess whether the model could guide the net gain of the validation\ncohort. The DCA curve of the validation set is illustrated in Figure 6 . The SVM model\nhad significant utility in clinical decision-making in the entire validation\ncohort. Taken together, SVM is considered the best model choice for this\ndataset.   Figure 3.   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for multiple model\nclassifications of the training set.

Discussion  PCOS is a common gynecological endocrine disease that severely affects the quality of\nlife of patients. Although ultrasound and serum biochemical tests can be used to\ndiagnose some types of polycystic diseases according to the Rotterdam guidelines,  20  these were operator- and woman's menstrual cycle-dependent methods.\nUltrasound cannot reliably detect polycystic ovary morphology in patients with type\nB PCOS.  32  Furthermore, it is difficult to ensure that all patients receive daytime\nserology in high-dose screening. Also, the asynchrony in time and cost of ultrasound\nand serum biochemical assays greatly diminishes their clinical application\nvalue.  Tongue and pulse diagnoses in TCM are simple and direct methods to obtain clinical\ndiagnosis and treatment information. Also, these are noninvasive techniques to\ndetect the disease, determine disease severity, and evaluate treatment effects. In\nrecent years, the rapid development of computer technology has facilitated various\nmachine-learning methods in medical research. Using machine learning models to\npredict and classify the objective information of TCM diagnosis is beneficial to the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence for TCM diagnosis. 33 \u2013 35 Hence, we conducted a series\nof studies on this aspect. Tongue and pulse diagnoses are valuable in classifying\nand predicting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,  36  type 2 diabetes, 17 , 34 and hypertension. 33 , 37 However, the TCM tongue-pulse\ndiagnostic technique for diagnosing and predicting PCOS has not yet been reported.\nThe present study aimed to establish a machine learning model based on lingual pulse\ncharacteristic parameters as a noninvasive method to predict the onset of PCOS.  We analyzed and documented the data of 285 PCOS patients and 201 healthy women. To\nminimize multicollinearity between tongue and pulse data and avoid overfitting, we\napplied LASSO regression to screen the variables. The results showed that seven\ncharacteristic parameters of tongue and pulse (TB-L, TB-a, TB-b, TC-L, TC-a,\nh 3 , and h 4 /h 1 ) were closely related to PCOS\noccurrence. These features were added as independent factors to establish the PCOS\nprediction models.  CIE-Lab was selected as the color space for feature extraction from tongue imaging\ndata. The most prominent feature of CIE-Lab is the smooth changes in color space,\nwhich defines all the colors that can be perceived by the human eye. The amount of\nspatial color shift in the CIE-Lab color space does not change with devices and is\nmore valuable than the RGB color space in digital images for compensating for the\nlack of color space.  38   As shown in Figure 2 , this\nstudy found that TB-L, TB-a, TB-b, TC-L, and TC-a were essential parameters of\ntongue characteristics to distinguish PCOS patients from healthy women. The tongue\ncolors of TB-L and TC-L were lesser in the PCOS group than in the healthy group\n( P <\u20090.05), suggesting that the colors of the tongue body\nand tongue coating of the PCOS patients were darker. According to the TCM theory,\nthese results indicated that the tongue of healthy women is moister and brighter\nthan that of PCOS patients, indicating that the qi and blood circulation of PCOS\npatients are not as smooth as that of healthy individuals. The TB-a and TC-a values\nof the tongue coating in the PCOS group were lower than those in the healthy group\n( P <\u20090.05), indicating that the tongue body and tongue\ncoating in the PCOS group were not as high as the red value in the healthy group.\nThe tongue consists of blood vessels and nerves. The tongue of a healthy person is\nfull of blood, and hence, the color of the front of the tongue is reddish, implying\nthat the blood flow of the tongue of patients with PCOS is not as smooth as that of\nhealthy people, and the tongue's color reflects the lower value of red color. These\nfindings also suggested that the tongue coating in the PCOS group is thick, and the\ncolor exposure of the tongue is not apparent. The TB-b value of the tongue coating\nin the PCOS group was higher than that in the healthy group\n( P <\u20090.05), indicating that the tongue body of PCOS women was\nyellower than that of healthy women. The indicators of tongue yellowness in PCOS\npatients may be influenced by their thick tongue coating color. The tongue coating\nresults from a mixture of bacteria and food residues with the tongue mucosa and the\nelongated stratum corneum of the hyperkeratinized epithelium.  39  Hsieh et al.  14  proposed that the yellow color of the tongue coating is due to the yellowish\nappearance of sulfur compounds, such as dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and 2,4-dithiopentane.  40  Thus, it can thus be suggested that sulfide concentrations in the oral cavity\nof PCOS were higher than those in healthy women.  In addition, h 3 and h 4 /h 1 , the characteristic\nindicators of pulse condition, were also included in the analysis of the machine\nlearning model. The h 3 value means heavy wavefront wave amplitude and\nreflects arterial elasticity. These findings indicated that PCOS has a lower h3\nvalue than healthy women. The weakening of arterial elasticity is due to the gradual\ndeposition of excessive lipids in the blood, forming plaques in the arterial intima.\nNewman et al.  41  showed that women with PCOS disease often exhibit an atherogenic lipid\nprofile characterized by increased triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, and standard or increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is\nconsistent with our findings. The h 4 /h 1 mainly reflects the\nlevel of peripheral resistance. The h 4 /h 1 value of pulse in\nthe PCOS group was higher than that in the healthy group, suggesting that resistance\nto peripheral vascular contraction increased in patients with PCOS. Interestingly,\nincreased peripheral resistance restricts the aortic blood flow to the periphery.\nHence, the blood remains in the arterial blood vessels, and the pressure on the\nblood vessel wall increases, resulting in significantly increased diastolic blood\npressure. Our findings demonstrated that individuals with PCOS are more at risk of\nhigh blood pressure than healthy people. This finding is consistent with that of\nprevious studies, wherein women with PCOS were more hypertensive and frequently used\nantihypertensive medication than the controls.  42   Machine learning is an implementation method of artificial intelligence and a major\nresearch direction in life sciences. In this study, three algorithms, MLP\nclassifier, XGBoost classifier, and SVM, were used for classification modeling.\nCombined with AUROC, DeLong test, and DCA curve evaluation, the SVM prediction model\nhas the best classification effect and net income. It is a novel and applicable\nfew-shot learning method with a solid theoretical foundation. Also, it is not\nsensitive to outliers and can help us capture critical samples. The advantage of the\nmethod is the simple algorithm and robustness. Herein, we focused on the AUROC\nobtained by these predictive models and compared the DCA curves of different models.\nIn addition to the diagnostic accuracy of the predictive model, we also considered\nthe clinical utility of a specific model. Therefore, the obtained optimal model\nfulfills the clinical needs and is suitable for clinical decision-making.    Conclusion  Machine learning techniques can estimate the risk of PCOS with high accuracy. These\nmethods provide physicians with a convenient and noninvasive method for screening\nand diagnosing PCOS patients. TB-L, TB-a, TB-b, TC-L, and TC-a in tongue parameters\nand h 3 , h 4 /h 1 in pulse parameters are closely\nrelated to PCOS occurrence. This study evaluated the performance of the MLP\nclassifier, XGBoost classifier, and SVM methods in identifying PCOS occurrence.\nTaken together, the SVM model shows the best performance. Therefore, we speculated\nthat the machine learning classification model based on tongue and pulse data has\nglorious performance and can adequately predict PCOS risk. In the future, we will\ncollect additional data and explore other machine learning algorithms to obtain PCOS\nrisk prediction models with even higher prediction accuracy.
