    "abstract": "The polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder,\ncharacterized by the dysregulation of ovarian angiogenesis. This alteration\ncan be related to changes in the activities of the vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF) gene. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been\nobserved in the promoter, intronic, and untranslated regions of the VEGF\ngene, and several studies have suggested that these polymorphisms may be\nassociated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome. This study aimed to\ninvestigate the association between rs2010963 and rs833061 polymorphisms and\nhaplotypes of VEGF in the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome. A total of 210 women, 102 diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and 108\ncontrols, participated in this study. The genotyping of the samples was\nperformed by PCR-RFLP and real-time PCR for rs2010963 and rs833061\npolymorphisms, respectively. The statistical analyses were performed by the\nchi-square test and logistic regression model. The clinical characteristics of the patients showed that 75.8% of the\npatients did not become pregnant, 36.3% had a family history of polycystic\novary syndrome, 58.6% were obese, and about 60% had clinical characteristics\nof hyperandrogenism. There were no associations between the distribution of\nrs2010963 (OR 1.24; 95%CI 0.60\u20132.57; p=0.56) and rs833061 (OR 0.78; 95%CI\n0.32\u20131.92; p=0.59) in patients and controls.

    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder, and its\nclinical features include hirsutism, infertility, acne, alopecia, oligo-anovulation,\nand metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, excessive weight or obesity,\ntype 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease  1 , 2  .  Dysregulation of ovarian angiogenesis contributes to abnormal follicular development\nin women with PCOS. This alteration may contribute to the ovarian features of PCOS,\nsuch as abnormal follicular development, increase in the number of small follicles,\nand failure in the selection of the dominant follicle, with anovulation and cyst formation  3  .  Modifications in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are associated\nwith the ovarian angiogenesis  3  . In the ovary, this gene is expressed in theca cells, granulosa lutein cells,\nand interstitial tissues and may be involved in the physiological regulation of\novarian angiogenesis, in a manner that suggests a role of this growth factor in both\ncyclic angiogenesis and regulation of vascular permeability, both critical for\novarian folliculogenesis and for normal reproductive function  4  . The VEGF gene is located in the chromosome region 6p21.3  5  . Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been observed in the promoter,\nintronic, and untranslated regions of the VEGF gene, and several studies have\nsuggested VEGF gene polymorphisms may be associated with PCOS risk  6 , 7 , 8  .  VEGF rs833061 T and rs2010963 G alleles appear to correlate with altered VEGF\nexpression levels. The increased levels of VEGF have been reported in PCOS6. The\nrs2010963 and rs833061 SNPs VEGF have recently been investigated in five independent\nstudies6-10. One of them evaluated the association of VEGFA SNPs (nine tested\nvariants) with altered VEGF secretion level and PCOS among ethnically matched\ncontrol women. This study showed that VEGF levels in rs833061 genotypes were\nsignificantly higher in PCOS9. The other study also published in 2019 investigated\nSNPs rs2010963 and rs833061 and showed that the first one may be associated with the\nrisk of PCOS in Chinese women10. The studies published in 20206-8 are of the\nmeta-analysis type and confirm associations of polymorphisms in the VEGF gene with\nsusceptibility to PCOS, with emphasis on rs20109637,8.  The rs2010963 polymorphism had been described as C\u2192T exchange at nucleotide position\n936, in the 3\u02b9-UTR of the VEGF gene, and was associated with lower VEGF plasma levels  11  . Therefore, the rs833061 is located in the promoter region and has been\nassociated with increased VEGF expression levels  12  .  In the literature, there are several studies on polymorphisms in the VEGF gene in\npatients with PCOS from different populations; however, no research was conducted on\nthese two polymorphisms in Brazilian women.  The objective of this study was to investigate the association of the VEGF\npolymorphisms rs201093 and rs833061 and to identify the frequency of haplotypes with\nthe risk of developing PCOS in women compared with control group.    METHODS   Subjects  This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal\nUniversity of Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro (UFTM), protocol 1796, and all participants\nsigned an informed consent form.  Participants\u2019 inclusion in the study occurred in the period from 2012 to 2016.\nThis case-control study included 102 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PCOS\nand 108 control women. The PCOS diagnosis was based on Rotterdam criteria, and\nthe patients who visited the Endocrinology and Gynecology Outpatient Clinic of\nthe UFTM were selected. In the control group, women at reproductive age who had\nno history of hyperandrogenism, menstrual dysfunction, infertility, or\nsonographic sign of PCOS, and those who sought medical care for gynecological\nroutine were selected for the study. All participants answered a questionnaire\nabout the risk factors.    Molecular analysis  Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood was extracted by a salting-out method.  Genotyping of the rs2010963 polymorphism was performed in 106 PCOS patients and\n97 controls using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length\npolymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.  The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 30 \u03bcL containing approximately 100\nng genomic DNA, 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1 mM MgCl 2 (25 mM), 2 \u03bcM of dNTP, 20\npmol of each primer (F: 5\u00b4-CCGACGGCTTGGGGAGATTG-3\u00b4; R:\n5\u00b4-CGGCGGTCACCCCCAAAAG-3\u00b4), 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 5% of glycerol. The\namplification program consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 10\nmin and 40 cycles (denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, annealing for 45 s at 62\u00b0C,\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s) and final extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C.  The PCR products were digested with 0.2 U of the BsmFI restriction enzyme.\nDigested fragments were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nAfter the restriction enzyme treatment, the CC genotype was visualized as a\nsingle 197 bp fragment; the CG genotype as three fragments of 197, 167, and 30\nbp; and the GG genotype was visualized as two fragments of 167 and 30 bp.  The real-time PCR allelic discrimination technique was used to analyze the\nrs833061 polymorphism in 94 patients and 87 controls, on the ABI PRISM 7500\nSequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Minor Groove Binder\n(MGB) probes. Primers and probes were designed by Life Technologies (ID:\nC_1647381_10).    Statistical analysis  The chi-square test was used for the statistical analysis of the genotypic and\nallelic distribution of the polymorphisms, as well as to verify the\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). A statistical power of 95% was tested using\nthe G* Power program 3.1.9.2. In addition, a post-hoc test with the total sample\n(n=210) was performed, with an effect size of 0.27 and an alpha significance\nlevel of 0.05. The multiple logistic regression model was used to determine the\neffect of risk factors (e.g., family history, smoking, alcohol consumption, and\nthe presence of polymorphism) in PCOS. The SNPStats program was used for the\nlogistic regression model adjusted for age. The effect of polymorphisms was\nevaluated by the following inheritance models: codominance, dominance,\nrecessive, and overdominance.  The haplotype from VEGF gene polymorphisms was inferred using the SNPStats\nprogram, checking the estimated population frequency of the haplotypes.  The results were presented in the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval\n(95%CI), with the level of statistical significance being defined as p<0.05.\nA post-hoc analysis was performed, and the statistical power for association\ntests was found to be 98%.     RESULTS  The clinical characteristics of the patients showed that 75.8% of the patients did\nnot become pregnant, 36.3% had a family history of PCOS, 58.6% were obese, and about\n60% had clinical characteristics of hyperandrogenism.  In the univariate analysis, no statistically significant differences were observed\nbetween the two groups for polymorphisms rs2010963 and rs833061 (\u03c7 2 =0.38,\np=0.83 and \u03c7 2 =0.86, p=0.65, respectively). For the allele frequencies, no\ndifferences were found between the groups (\u03c7 2 =0.18, p=0.67 and\n\u03c7 2 =0.02, p=1.00, respectively).  The genotype distributions of the rs2010963 and rs833061 polymorphisms were in\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both patient (\u03c7 2 =2.35; p=0.12;\n\u03c7 2 =0.05; p=0.82) and control (\u03c7 2 =1.05; p=0.31;\n\u03c7 2 =1.04; p=0.31) groups.  The genotypes of 90 women with PCOS and 80 controls were adjusted for age according\nto the heritable models and showed no association between the polymorphisms and PCOS\n( Table 1 ).   Table 1.

All estimated haplotypes had similar\nfrequencies between the two groups.  The multiple logistic regression data are shown in Table 2 , considering the risk factors (e.g., family history, smoking,\nand alcoholism) and the two polymorphisms studied in PCOS patients (n=88) and\ncontrols (n=81). It was evidenced that the family history is more frequent in\npatients with PCOS, smoking is more frequent in controls, and there are no\ndifferences in relation to alcoholism and in the distribution of the rs2010963 and\nrs833061 polymorphisms.

DISCUSSION  VEGF alterations characterize numerous pathologies, either with increased, decreased,\nor abnormal angiogenesis. Therefore, it has been suggested that these alterations\nmay be associated with the decreased, or lack of, ovulation rates and with the\nformation of many antral follicles in the PCOS ovaries. According to the literature,\nfurther studies are required to clarify the role of angiogenesis in PCOS and to\ndevelop new potential therapies  2 , 3  , such as bromocriptine, metformin, and melatonin  13 , 14 , 15  .  The VEGF is the main angiogenic factor that promotes endothelial cell proliferation\nand migration and vascular permeability  3  . Thus, genetic analysis in the VEGF gene may help clarify the pathogenesis of\nPCOS.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular study to investigate the\nassociation between rs2010963 and rs833061 polymorphisms and PCOS susceptibility in\nBrazilian women. With regard to VEGF, our group evaluated the polymorphisms\nrs3025039, rs1570360, and rs699947 and showed that the polymorphism rs1570360 is\nassociated with PCOS and that the T-G-C haplotype could be associated with\nprotective factors  16  .  Several VEGF SNPs are associated with various conditions in women, including endometriosis  17 , 18  , recurrent miscarriage  19  , and preeclampsia  20  . These results together suggest that VEGF SNP can contribute to the\npathogenesis of female reproductive diseases.  In the sample analyzed, the rs2010963 and rs833061 polymorphisms are not associated\nwith PCOS. The lack of significance in this study may be due to the sample size,\nsample stratification, and ethnic issues related to the Brazilian population.\nHowever, they have been extensively studied with conflicting results ( Table 3 )  9 , 10 , 12 , 21 \u2013 24  , probably due to different ethnicities. It is worth mentioning that PCOS is a\nmultifactorial disease and environmental factors and polymorphisms in genes other\nthan VEGF might play an important role in women\u2019s susceptibility to its\noccurrence.   Table 3.   Summary of the mains results of previous studies that investigated\nrs2010963 and rs833061 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of vascular\nendothelial growth factor gene in polycystic ovary syndrome.      Study  VEGF gene polymorphisms  Sample  Main results and/or conclusions      Bao et al.  9    rs1547651, rs1570360, rs2010963,\nrs3025020, rs3025039, rs699947, rs833061, rs833058, and\nrs833068  55 women with PCOS and 52 control\nsubjects.  VEGF levels in rs699947 (AA-major\nhomozygous), rs3025039 (CC-major homozygous), and rs833061 (TT &\nCC-major & minor homozygous) genotypes were significantly higher\nin PCOS. The study results evidently proved that the allelic\nvariants in genes may be a factor for PCOS and VEGF serum levels\nwith respect to few SNP variants only.    Huang et al.  10    rs2010963, and rs833061  118 women with PCOS and 130\ncontrols.  Our study shows for the first time that\nthe rs2010963 polymorphism may be associated with a risk of PCOS in\nNorthern Chinese women.    Almawi et al.  21    rs833052, rs1547651,\nrs699947, rs833061, rs1570360, rs2010963,\nrs25648, rs833068, rs833070, rs3025020, rs3025026, and\nrs3025039  382 women with PCOS, and 393 control\nsubjects.  Among the 12 tested VEGFA SNPs, minor\nallele frequency of only rs3025020 was significantly higher in PCOS\ncases than control women. Increased and reduced PCOS risk was seen\nwith rs3025020 and rs2010963 genotypes, respectively. Increases and\nreduction in VEGF levels were associated with rs3025020 and\nrs2010963, respectively. Our study also confirmed the association of\nCAACAGCGA haplotype with increased risk of PCOS.    Ben Salem et al.  22    rs699947, rs833061, rs1570360,\nrs833068, rs3025020, and rs3025039  118 PCOS patients and 150\ncontrols.  We observed 10 haplotypes in our\nstudied cohort where H1 (ACGG), H2 (ACAG), H7 (CTGG), and H8 (CTGA)\nwere the most frequent. We observed the association of the genotype\nCT of the SNP rs3025039 with PCOS phenotype.    Guruvaiah et al.  23    -460C/T and +405C/G  126 PCOS patients and 130\ncontrols.  The frequencies of +405G/G genotype\n(p=0.03) and +405G alleles (p=0.006) were significantly higher in\npatients compared to controls. Whereas the genotype and allele\nfrequencies of -460C/T SNP were not significantly different between\npatients and controls. Our findings suggest that the VEGF +405C/G\npolymorphism may constitute an inheritable risk factor for PCOS in\nSouth Indian women.    Vural et al.  12    -2578A/C, -460T/C, and\n+405C/G  137 patients with PCOS and 155\nhealthy women.  We did not find any evidence for\nassociation between PCOS and the three individual SNPs. The\nhaplotype -2578C/-460T/+405G was significantly overexpressed in the\nPCOS group in comparison with controls (p=0.019).    Lee et al.  24    -2488C>T, -634G>C, -7C>T, +3436G>C,\n+6112C>A, +6594C>T, +9374G>A, +9812C>T,\n+13125C>T, and +13553C>T  134 patients with PCOS and 100\nhealthy women as controls.  We concluded that one novel SNP at\n+9812 site, one known SNP at +13553 site, and one selected haplotype\nin the VEGF gene have a high possibility of\nsignificant associations with the pathogenesis of PCOS in a Korean\npopulation.      There are seven studies that investigated the polymorphisms rs2010963 and rs833061 of\nthe VEGF gene. Three studies did not confirm any association between PCOS and the\npolymorphisms investigated  17 , 19 , 20  , a result similar to that found in this study. In contrast, other studies\nfound an association of polymorphism rs2010963  17 , 22 , 23  and rs833061  10  with PCOS.  In relation to haplotype analysis, two studies showed a relationship between\nhaplotypes and PCOS  21 , 24  . However, there is no significant difference in the occurrence of the four\nhaplotypes between the controls and cases, in relation to the polymorphisms\nrs2010963 and rs833061  17  , which is in agreement with our results.  A meta-analysis of seven studies showed there is little association between PCOS risk\nand the VEGF gene polymorphisms rs2010963, rs833061, and rs699947 in the general\npopulations, whereas the genotype CC (rs2010963) might decrease the risk of PCOS\namong Asian women  8  . Another recent meta-analysis included 10 relevant case-control studies,\ninvolving 1347 PCOS cases and 1378 controls. The VEGF rs2010963 polymorphism was\nassociated with decreased PCOS risk in the whole population and the Asian populations  9  .  This study demonstrated that family history is more frequent in patients with PCOS.\nAccording to the literature, multiple familial and twin studies confirmed the role\nof genetics in the etiology of PCOS with high heritability of 70%  21  .  There are some limitations to our study. The serum levels of the VEGF are not\nmeasured. However, it is also worth mentioning that our study so far is the only one\nto evaluate these polymorphisms in the Brazilian population.    CONCLUSIONS  The PCOS patients have similar rates of VEGF polymorphisms rs2010963 and rs833061 on\nthe general population.",

            "content": "Study  VEGF gene polymorphisms  Sample  Main results and/or conclusions      Bao et al.  9    rs1547651, rs1570360, rs2010963,\nrs3025020, rs3025039, rs699947, rs833061, rs833058, and\nrs833068  55 women with PCOS and 52 control\nsubjects.  VEGF levels in rs699947 (AA-major\nhomozygous), rs3025039 (CC-major homozygous), and rs833061 (TT &\nCC-major & minor homozygous) genotypes were significantly higher\nin PCOS. The study results evidently proved that the allelic\nvariants in genes may be a factor for PCOS and VEGF serum levels\nwith respect to few SNP variants only.    Huang et al.  10    rs2010963, and rs833061  118 women with PCOS and 130\ncontrols.  Our study shows for the first time that\nthe rs2010963 polymorphism may be associated with a risk of PCOS in\nNorthern Chinese women.    Almawi et al.  21    rs833052, rs1547651,\nrs699947, rs833061, rs1570360, rs2010963,\nrs25648, rs833068, rs833070, rs3025020, rs3025026, and\nrs3025039  382 women with PCOS, and 393 control\nsubjects.  Among the 12 tested VEGFA SNPs, minor\nallele frequency of only rs3025020 was significantly higher in PCOS\ncases than control women. Increased and reduced PCOS risk was seen\nwith rs3025020 and rs2010963 genotypes, respectively. Increases and\nreduction in VEGF levels were associated with rs3025020 and\nrs2010963, respectively. Our study also confirmed the association of\nCAACAGCGA haplotype with increased risk of PCOS.    Ben Salem et al.  22    rs699947, rs833061, rs1570360,\nrs833068, rs3025020, and rs3025039  118 PCOS patients and 150\ncontrols.  We observed 10 haplotypes in our\nstudied cohort where H1 (ACGG), H2 (ACAG), H7 (CTGG), and H8 (CTGA)\nwere the most frequent. We observed the association of the genotype\nCT of the SNP rs3025039 with PCOS phenotype.    Guruvaiah et al.  23    -460C/T and +405C/G  126 PCOS patients and 130\ncontrols.  The frequencies of +405G/G genotype\n(p=0.03) and +405G alleles (p=0.006) were significantly higher in\npatients compared to controls. Whereas the genotype and allele\nfrequencies of -460C/T SNP were not significantly different between\npatients and controls. Our findings suggest that the VEGF +405C/G\npolymorphism may constitute an inheritable risk factor for PCOS in\nSouth Indian women.    Vural et al.  12    -2578A/C, -460T/C, and\n+405C/G  137 patients with PCOS and 155\nhealthy women.  We did not find any evidence for\nassociation between PCOS and the three individual SNPs. The\nhaplotype -2578C/-460T/+405G was significantly overexpressed in the\nPCOS group in comparison with controls (p=0.019).    Lee et al.  24    -2488C>T, -634G>C, -7C>T, +3436G>C,\n+6112C>A, +6594C>T, +9374G>A, +9812C>T,\n+13125C>T, and +13553C>T  134 patients with PCOS and 100\nhealthy women as controls.  We concluded that one novel SNP at\n+9812 site, one known SNP at +13553 site, and one selected haplotype\nin the VEGF gene have a high possibility of\nsignificant associations with the pathogenesis of PCOS in a Korean\npopulation."
