    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age with a prevalence that may be close to 18% [ 1 ]. It has adverse reproductive and metabolic implications [ 2 ], and it is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility [ 3 ]. The pathophysiology of PCOS is still poorly understood; however, several potential genetic susceptibility factors have been identified, including\u00a0mutations and polymorphisms on the genes involved in the gonadal axis, steroid metabolism, cardiovascular risk, and insulin resistance [ 4 ]. In the setting of assisted reproduction techniques (ART), infertile women with PCOS constitute a challenge for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) [ 5 ], and an influence of some polymorphic variations may be at play.  Estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), acting together, lead to an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone receptor ( FSHR ) expression in the granulosa cells contributing to the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles [ 6 ].  FSH is important for follicular development and oocyte maturation. Ovarian sensitivity or resistance to exogenous FSH is believed to be influenced by genetic variations related to FSH and its receptor [ 7 ]. The FSHR ,\u00a0encoded by a gene located in 2q, is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family [ 8 ]. Abnormal FSHR function may lead to arrested follicular development, resulting in amenorrhea and high FSH levels [ 9 ]. Mutations in the FSHR are rare, however, several polymorphisms have been identified [ 7 ]. Two variants in exon 10 have received particular attention. In codon 307, a substitution of adenine to guanine in the extracellular domain of the FSHR results in a change from threonine (Thr) to alanine (Ala) - FSHR rs6165 (c.919G>A, p.Thr307Ala). In codon 680, a substitution of adenine to guanine leads an asparaginase codon to be replaced by a serine codon - FSHR rs6166 (c.2039A>G, p.Asn680Ser) [ 10 ]. Both variants are in almost complete linkage disequilibrium [ 11 , 12 ]. An association between FSHR polymorphism and PCOS risk has been studied with conflicting results [ 4 ]. Valkenburg\u00a0et al. did not find an association between FSHR polymorphisms and disease risk\u00a0but do report an association with its phenotype and hormone levels [ 12 ]. There is also some data to support an association between the SS variant of the FSHR rs6166 polymorphism with FSH resistance [ 13 ] and potentially altered response to ovarian stimulation [ 11 ].  Estrogen is essential to trigger the cascade of events that culminates in ovulation as it is a positive regulator of the preovulatory gonadotropin surge [ 14 ]. There are data associating estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) gene polymorphisms with ovulatory defects [ 14 ] and a possible role in PCOS susceptibility has been suggested [ 15 ]. ESR1 , located on chromosome 6q25.1, has been reported to have two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron, at restriction enzyme sites: (1) Pvull c.453-397 T\u2009>\u2009C (rs2234693)\u00a0(\u2212397 TC, rs2234693, NM_000125.3:c.453-397 T\u2009>\u2009C) and (2) XbaI (\u2212351 AG, rs9340799, NM_000125.3:c.453-351A\u2009>\u2009G) [ 16 ].  Knowledge of genetic factors that may influence the ovarian response to COS may contribute to the development of pharmacogenetic approaches [ 17 ]. In this study, we genotyped the FSHR c.2039A>G (rs6166) polymorphism and one of the most common SNP in ESR1 , ESR1 Pvull\u00a0c.453-397 T\u2009>\u2009C (rs2234693), in a group of women with PCOS and a control group undergoing\u00a0in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. We aimed to investigate if these SNPs influence the risk and phenotype of PCOS in the Portuguese population. We also sought to investigate if either of these polymorphisms was associated with PCOS biochemical phenotype and with the result of COS.    Materials and methods  Patient selection  We carried out a retrospective observational study of women who underwent infertility treatment\u00a0in a tertiary fertility clinic between 2013 and 2019.  This study was designed, conducted, and reported following the principles of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. The Hospital Ethics Board granted ethical approval (internal reference number: 171-20), and all participants gave their written informed consent for blood sampling and genetic investigations for these specific targets.  The PCOS group (n = 88) and the control group (n = 80) were constituted of infertile patients undergoing the first cycle of IVF treatment. COS was performed with\u00a0gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol, using recombinant human FSH (rhFSH).  The diagnosis of PCOS was established based on the 2003 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Rotterdam criteria\u00a0[ 18 ]. The presence of PCOS was confirmed by vaginal ultrasound examination.  The control group included age and body mass index (BMI) matched women with regular menstrual cycles. Additionally, the controls were\u00a0infertile women with tubal obstruction with regular menstrual cycles, no clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and no polycystic ovaries. Patients with\u00a0male factor infertility, endometrial disease, or severe systemic illness were excluded from both groups.  Genotyping  Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from peripheral blood collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-coated tubes on day three of the follicular phase and stored at 4\u00b0C until DNA extraction.\u00a0Extraction of genomic\u00a0DNA\u00a0was performed using QIAamp\u00ae DNA Blood MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden,\u00a0Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\u00a0QIAamp\u00ae\u00a0DNA Blood Kits provide silica-membrane-based DNA purification from biological fluids (including blood samples). We optimized buffers lyse samples, stabilized nucleic acids, and enhanced selective DNA adsorption to the membrane. Alcohol was added and sample\u00a0lysates were loaded onto the spin column. Finally, wash buffers were added to remove impurities and purified DNA was then eluted in low-salt buffer. The quantity and purity of each eluted sample were assessed by NanoDrop TM 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  DNA amplification was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers to assess FSHR rs6166 (c.2039A>G) and ESR1 rs2234693 (Pvull c.453-397 T\u2009>\u2009C), as described in Table 1 . Specifically, PCR was carried out in a 0.2-mL PCR tube with a 25 \u03bcL reaction volume, containing 0.1 \u03bcL of template genomic DNA, 1.25 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA),\u00a00.2 \u00b5M deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (Invitrogen), 0.2 \u00b5M primer reverse, and 0.2 \u00b5M primer forward (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA);\u00a0the reaction volume was adjusted with nuclease-free water. The amplification reaction for each primer set was conducted in a programmable c1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Nuclease-free water was used instead of genomic DNA as a blank to check for\u00a0DNA contamination.

To determine the genotype for each sample, PCR products were incubated and digested with the respective restriction enzyme; PvuII (Invitrogen) and BseNI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for ESR1 rs2234693 (Pvull c.453-397 T > C) and FSHR rs6166 (c.2039A>G), respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Table 2 ). The samples were then run on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (Invitrogen) at 80 V for 75 minutes and visualized by ultraviolet transilluminator (DNA MiniBIS Pro, DNR Bio Imaging System, Neve Yamin, Israel).

Figure 1   ESR1 rs2234693 genotypes  The CC genotype is represented by one band of 1374 bp, the CT genotype is identified by three bands of 1374 bp, 936 bp, and 438 bp, and the TT genotype is represented by two bands of 936 bp and 438 bp.  ESR1:\u00a0estrogen receptor 1.     FSHR rs6166 leads to a change from A to G. BseNI digestion produces an uncleaved 520 bp fragment that indicates homozygosity for asparagine (Asn/Asn). In contrast, two fragments of 413 and 520 bp indicate heterozygosity (Asn/Ser). The presence of one fragment of 413 bp reveals homozygosity for serine (Ser/Ser), as represented in\u00a0Figure 2 , as previously described in the work of Kuijper and collaborators\u00a0[ 13 ].   Figure 2   FSHR rs6166 genotypes  The AA genotype is represented by one band of 520 bp, the SA genotype is identified by two bands of 520 bp and 413 bp, and the SS genotype is represented by one band of 413 bp.  FSHR:\u00a0follicle-stimulating hormone receptor.     Data collection  Clinical information of the patients was collected from the medical records. Collected data included age, BMI, antral follicle count (AFC), plasma concentrations of progesterone, testosterone, anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol in the third and 23rd day of the menstrual cycle, outcomes of the IVF treatment, follicle count in the day of ovulation induction, number and quality of oocytes retrieved, and the number of blastocysts obtained. Information on prior medical history and medication use was also scanned for each of the patients to properly evaluate the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria.  For the included patients, the results of the analysis of each of the polymorphisms were also inserted in our database.  Data analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and SNPStats. Statistical significance was assumed for p-value < 0.05. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was confirmed for both polymorphisms.  For continuous variables, when normal distribution was confirmed (through standardized asymmetry) and homogeneity of variances of variables was noted, Student's t (for two groups) or ANOVA (for \u2265 three groups) tests were used to compare groups. In cases where it was not possible to assume a normal distribution, Mann-Whitney U and\u00a0Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparison between two or >\u00a0two groups, respectively. The chi-square test was performed for categorical variables to test differences in the distribution of two independent variables. Fisher's exact test was used instead whenever expected frequencies below five occurred with enough frequency.  After verifying the required assumptions, linear regression was used whenever there was a need to confirm an independent effect of an independent variable on a continuous dependent variable.    Results  Sample characterization  Our sample was composed of 168 women, 88 of whom had PCOS. Women from the PCOS and control groups did not differ in\u00a0age.  A comparison between PCOS and non-PCOS subjects regarding baseline characteristics, baseline hormonal levels, follicle count, and the number of oocyte numbers obtained is summarized in\u00a0Table 3 .

However, the groups differed in baseline hormonal levels (FSH and LH on days three and 23 of the menstrual cycle\u00a0and estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone on day 23). As expected, the AMH, AFC, and follicle count on the day of ovulation induction\u00a0were higher in the PCOS group. Even though there was a higher number of oocytes obtained in the PCOS group, the oocyte quality was lower. A higher number of\u00a0degenerative or atretic oocytes was found in the PCOS group.  Evaluation of whether there is an association between FSHR and ESR1 SNPs and PCOS risk  The results of the\u00a0genotype distribution of FSHR rs6166 genotype and ESR1 rs2234693 are reported in\u00a0Table 4 . We did not identify statistically significant\u00a0differences in the distribution between PCOS patients and controls.

Patients with the SS variant of the FSHR polymorphism had higher FSH levels on the third\u00a0day of the menstrual cycle (p = 0.011). We did not find other statistically significant differences in biochemical and ultrasonographic parameters in relation to the FSHR or the ESR1 genotypes.

We then performed linear regression, with age, BMI, and SS vs remaining genotypes. The model was statistically significant for predicting cumulative rhFSH dose (p = 0.001), with the presence of the FSHR rs6166 SS variant being an independent predictor (B = 0.222, t = 2.349, p = 0.021). For ESR1 rs2234693, the CT genotype was associated with a numerically higher rhFSH dose, but without achieving statistical significance.  No differences were observed with any polymorphisms concerning FSH dose, AFC, metaphase II oocytes, low-quality oocytes (metaphase I and atretic), and blastocyst number.    Discussion  In this study, we evaluated women with and without PCOS. By study design, the groups with and without PCOS were homogeneous in relation to age and BMI. Nevertheless, and in agreement with what is described, these two groups had significant differences in hormonal patterns. PCOS was associated with elevated gonadotropins and testosterone, and lower estrogens and progesterone. These women also had higher antral follicle count and more oocytes obtained on average. However, there was no statistically significant difference in relation to the percentage of mature oocytes. After applying\u00a0IVF techniques, the number of blastocysts obtained was similar between the two groups.\u00a0These data suggest\u00a0that\u00a0even though PCOS women have an endocrine dysregulation that causes anovulatory infertility, a good response after COS is expected, which is in accordance with previously published data\u00a0[ 19 ].  Our first question was whether FSHR rs6166 and ESR1 rs2234693 were associated with PCOS risk.\u00a0We did not find statistically significant differences in the distribution of each of the genotypes of FSHR rs6166 and ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphisms, suggesting that in our population, neither of the studied polymorphisms is associated with PCOS risk.  Indeed, results from previous studies regarding the relationship between both FSHR and ERS1 polymorphisms and PCOS present conflicting data. In a group of adolescents in Turkey, Unsal et al. did not find a different distribution of several FSHR polymorphisms associated with PCOS [ 4 ]. Wu et al. also failed to find an association between the FSHR polymorphisms and PCOS in women in the north of China, but the authors did report an association with higher levels of FSH [ 8 ]. An absence of association was also reported in Thai [ 20 ] and in Sri Lankan women [ 21 ]. More recently Wan et al. also reported an absence of association between several FSHR polymorphisms, including rs6166, and PCOS risk in Asian women [ 22 ]. An association between FSHR rs6166, but not rs6165, was reported by Gu et al. in Korean women [ 23 ]. Conversely, in an Italian cohort, Dolfin et al. did find a relationship between the rs6165 variant and PCOS risk [ 24 ]. Kim et al. found a significant association between rs6165 and rs6166 FSHR polymorphisms and PCOS in South Korea [ 11 ].  Regarding ERS1 , the contribution of ERS1 genetic variants to PCOS is also controversial. In a study from Korea, Kim\u00a0et al. reported an association with the risk of PCOS\u00a0[ 25 ].\u00a0Jiao\u00a0et al. also found such an association in the Chinese population\u00a0[ 26 ]. Conversely, Silva et al.\u00a0[ 27 ], Valkenburg et al.\u00a0[ 12 ], and Mir et al. [ 28 ]\u00a0found no association with PCOS risk. A recent meta-analysis found no significant association between several ERS1 polymorphisms and PCOS risk, even taking ethnicity into account\u00a0[ 29 ].  It has also been hypothesized that even if there is no association between FSHR polymorphisms or ERS1 and disease risk, there may be an association with its phenotype and hormone levels [ 12 , 27 ]. As such, we aimed to understand whether the distinctive hormonal pattern observed in these patients could be attributed to FSHR rs6166 or ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphisms. The SS genotype of the FSHR rs6166 polymorphism was associated with higher FSH levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle. We found no other differences in evaluating the gonadal axes, AMH, or AFC between different FSHR rs6166 and ESR1 rs2234693 genotypes. It has previously been reported that the SS variant of the FSHR rs6166 polymorphism may be less sensitive to FSH associated with higher FSH levels [ 30 , 31 ]. Our findings support this theory.  There has been some research on the influence of the polymorphisms evaluated in this study on IVF outcomes. As such, we also sought to understand if FSHR and ESR1 SNPs influence immediate IVF outcomes in PCOS women. We did not find variations in oocyte quality or the number of blastocysts obtained in relation to these polymorphisms.\u00a0We did, however, find a need for higher rhFSH dose in women with the FSHR rs6166\u00a0S/S variant, which may indicate a tendency toward\u00a0FSH resistance in patients with these variants.\u00a0Some authors have reported differences in response to COS related to FSHR rs6166. Jun\u00a0et al. found a lower number of oocytes retrieved in association with the S/S variant\u00a0[ 32 ]. Behre\u00a0et al. reported lower FSHR sensitivity associated with this variant, but they also state that it can be overcome by increasing the rhFSH dose\u00a0[ 33 ]. Loutradis\u00a0et al.\u00a0found an association between the AS variant and more obtained follicles and oocytes\u00a0[ 34 ]. Regarding the ERS1 rs2234693 polymorphism, there are fewer studies. However, studies with Chinese\u00a0[ 6 ]\u00a0and Greek women\u00a0[ 35 ]\u00a0suggest that the variant is associated with worse IVF results, which we did not observe in our sample.  Controversial findings in this field\u00a0may be related to differences in study design and sample selection. As other authors have stated, the contribution of each gene in multifactorial diseases, such as PCOS, is small, and very large samples may be necessary to detect a small effect. Furthermore, there is the possibility of incomplete penetrance\u00a0and gene-gene interactions; therefore, studies of individual genes in each population may not reveal the general pattern\u00a0[ 31 ]. Nevertheless, it is possible that\u00a0due to genetic heterogeneity, the same polymorphism has distinct contributions to PCOS risk and phenotype across different populations. This adds another level of complexity when defining the genetic risk factors based on a complex disease.  Our study has some limitations, mainly the relatively small sample size and lack of data on the women in whom cycle cancelation was required. The fact that the population studied is composed exclusively of women referred for fertility treatments precludes the generalization of our conclusions to all Portuguese PCOS patients.\u00a0Additionally, controversial findings still exist when applying SNPs analysis in infertile populations, which may be related to the diverse populations and genotyping methods.    Conclusions  As far as we know, this is the first study evaluating the association between FSHR rs6166 and ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphisms and PCOS in the Portuguese population with infertility. Our data do not support an association between these polymorphisms and PCOS risk, phenotype, and immediate IVF outcomes. Furthermore, the ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphism was not associated with a difference in baseline hormone values \u200b\u200bor response to ovarian stimulation. Nevertheless, the SS genotype of the FSHR rs6166 polymorphism was associated with higher FSH levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle and also with a need for a higher cumulative dose of FSH in COS, which may reflect a lower sensitivity to FSH. Therefore, COS with higher doses of FSH may be more suitable in women with this genotype.",
