    "body": "Introduction and background  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) stands as one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders affecting individuals of reproductive age. Characterized by hormonal imbalances, irregular menstruation, and the presence of cysts on the ovaries, PCOS extends beyond its physiological manifestations, permeating into the psychosocial realm of those affected [ 1 ]. PCOS is a multifaceted health condition that transcends the confines of gynecological concerns. As an endocrine disorder, it manifests through disruptions in hormonal levels, most notably androgen excess, insulin resistance, and irregular ovulation. Clinically, the syndrome is diagnosed based on the Rotterdam criteria, which encompass hyperandrogenism, irregular menstrual cycles, and the presence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The physical consequences of PCOS\u00a0have been extensively documented, yet the effects on mental health and social well-being are equally profound [ 2 ].  While the physical symptoms of PCOS are often the primary focus of clinical attention, the psychosocial aspects of this syndrome play a pivotal role in the overall well-being of affected individuals. The invisible struggle that accompanies PCOS involves coping with societal misconceptions, facing stigmatization, and navigating the often complex interplay between physical and mental health. Recognizing and addressing these psychosocial dimensions is imperative for comprehensive, patient-centered care [ 3 ].  The purpose of this review is to delve into the psychosocial intricacies of PCOS, shedding light on the often-overlooked aspects that significantly impact the lives of those affected. By synthesizing existing literature, exploring the link between PCOS and mental health, and investigating the role of societal perceptions, this review aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the holistic implications of PCOS. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of incorporating psychosocial considerations into clinical practice, advocating for a more comprehensive and compassionate approach to PCOS care.    Review  Understanding PCOS  PCOS\u00a0is a complex condition diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries [ 1 , 4 , 5 ]. The condition is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive-aged women in the United States, affecting approximately 7% of female patients [ 5 ]. The exact etiology of PCOS is thought to emerge from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental traits, with evidence indicating a strong correlation between familial factors and the presence of PCOS [ 5 ].  Prevalence and Demographics  PCOS affects women's mental health and quality of life, with anxiety and depression being prevalent issues among patients [ 6 ]. Studies have shown that women with PCOS tend to experience mildly elevated anxiety and depression [ 6 ]. The condition is stigmatizing and affects a woman's identity, mental health, and quality of life [ 6 ]. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among women with PCOS ranges from 28% to 39% for anxiety and 11% to 25% for depression [ 6 ].  Physical Symptoms and Health Implications  The clinical presentation of PCOS\u00a0is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, contributing to its variable nature among affected individuals. One hallmark of PCOS is the presence of signs indicating hyperandrogenism, a condition marked by elevated levels of male hormones, particularly androgens. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS often involve the observation of hyperandrogenism along with additional factors, such as irregular menstrual cycles, the presence of ovarian cysts, and related reproductive concerns [ 5 ].  The physical manifestations of PCOS are wide-ranging and can be observed in various ways. Hirsutism, characterized by excessive hair growth, is a common manifestation resulting from elevated androgen levels. Another notable physical symptom is insulin resistance, a condition where cells exhibit reduced responsiveness to insulin, leading to metabolic disturbances and increased risk of other health issues, such as type 2 diabetes. Individuals with PCOS often experience acne, a skin condition. Additionally, irregular menstrual periods, including oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstrual periods) or amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods), are frequently observed [ 4 ]. The impact of PCOS extends beyond its immediate physical symptoms, influencing long-term health. Individuals with PCOS face an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to insulin resistance. Additionally, the syndrome is associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing high blood pressure. Importantly, PCOS poses a potential risk factor for endometrial cancer, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and comprehensive healthcare for individuals with this syndrome [ 4 ].  Role of Hormones in PCOS  The role of hormones in PCOS\u00a0is pivotal in understanding its pathogenesis. Altered luteinizing hormone (LH) action, insulin resistance, and a potential predisposition to hyperandrogenism have been identified as key components in the development of PCOS [ 5 ]. One proposed theory suggests that underlying insulin resistance plays a crucial role in exacerbating hyperandrogenism. This occurs through the suppression of sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis and an increase in adrenal and ovarian synthesis of androgens, ultimately leading to elevated androgen levels [ 5 ]. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are intricately linked to these hormonal imbalances, encompassing factors related to hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and the presence of polycystic ovaries. The condition not only manifests with physical symptoms but also significantly impacts women's mental health and overall quality of life. The prevalence of PCOS is notable, further underscoring the importance of understanding its hormonal underpinnings [ 5 ].\u00a0The interplay between these hormonal factors not only contributes to the characteristic symptoms that define PCOS but also poses long-term health implications. Recognizing the central role of hormones, especially insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions and treatment strategies aimed at addressing the hormonal imbalances that underlie the complex landscape of PCOS [ 5 ]. Table 1 describes the role of hormones in PCOS.   Table 1   Role of hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)      Hormone  Role in PCOS  Mechanism/relation    LH (luteinizing hormone)  Altered LH action is associated with PCOS pathogenesis.  Dysregulation of LH contributes to hormonal imbalances in PCOS.    Insulin  Insulin resistance is a key factor in PCOS development.  Underlying insulin resistance exacerbates hyperandrogenism and affects androgen synthesis.    Androgens  Hyperandrogenism is a characteristic feature of PCOS.  Increased adrenal and ovarian synthesis of androgens, influenced by insulin resistance.    SHBG (sex hormone\u2013binding globulin)  Suppression of SHBG synthesis is linked to PCOS.  Insulin resistance suppresses SHBG synthesis, contributing to elevated androgen levels.      The invisible struggle: the stigma surrounding PCOS  Social Misconceptions and Stereotypes  The stigmatization of PCOS often begins with prevalent social misconceptions and stereotypes that perpetuate a narrow understanding of this complex syndrome. Misguided beliefs surrounding PCOS contribute to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, such as the notion that it is solely a reproductive issue or that it is directly linked to lifestyle choices. These misconceptions not only hinder public awareness but also fuel the marginalization of individuals grappling with PCOS, making it essential to dismantle these unfounded beliefs for a more informed and empathetic societal perspective [ 7 ].  Impact of Cultural and Societal Norms  Cultural and societal norms further compound the invisible struggle experienced by those with PCOS. Different cultures may hold distinct views on fertility, body image, and gender roles, thereby influencing how PCOS is perceived within various communities. The pressure to conform to societal expectations regarding femininity and fertility can exacerbate the emotional toll on individuals with PCOS, leading to feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Understanding and addressing these cultural influences are crucial for fostering an environment that supports individuals affected by PCOS [ 8 ].  Challenges in Diagnosis and Recognition  The journey to a PCOS diagnosis is often riddled with challenges, contributing to the invisible nature of the struggle. Healthcare providers may encounter difficulties recognizing the syndrome due to its heterogeneous presentation and the absence of a definitive diagnostic test. This diagnostic uncertainty can lead to delayed identification and intervention, leaving individuals to grapple with symptoms and uncertainties. Addressing these challenges in the diagnostic process is pivotal for ensuring timely and accurate support for those navigating the complexities of PCOS [ 9 ].  The Need to Dispel Myths and Misinformation  A cornerstone in combating the stigma surrounding PCOS lies in the urgent need to dispel prevailing myths and misinformation. Myths perpetuated by outdated sources, social media, and even healthcare misconceptions contribute to a climate of misunderstanding. Common misconceptions, such as PCOS being solely a reproductive issue or a consequence of lifestyle choices, need to be debunked through accurate and accessible information. Empowering individuals with knowledge is crucial to dispelling myths and instrumental in fostering a sense of agency and control over their health [ 10 ].  Mental health impacts of PCOS  Depression and Anxiety  The intersection of PCOS and mental health is complex, with individuals often grappling with heightened risks of depression and anxiety. The hormonal imbalances characteristic of PCOS can contribute to mood disturbances, amplifying the risk of depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders. Beyond the physiological factors, the emotional toll of managing a chronic condition, coupled with societal pressures and potential fertility concerns, can further contribute to the heightened prevalence of depression and anxiety among those with PCOS. Recognizing and addressing these mental health implications is crucial for fostering a holistic approach to PCOS care [ 11 ]. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder [ 12 ]. Studies have shown that women with PCOS are more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of depression and experience worse symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 12 ]. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among women with PCOS ranges from 28% to 39% for anxiety and 11% to 25% for depression [ 6 ].  Body Image Issues and Self-Esteem  PCOS has profound effects on body image and self-esteem, as individuals may contend with physical symptoms such as weight gain, acne, and hirsutism. Societal beauty standards often exacerbate these challenges, perpetuating unrealistic expectations that can be particularly distressing for individuals with PCOS. The visible manifestations of the syndrome can lead to a negative self-perception and, in some cases, contribute to the development of eating disorders. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of PCOS on body image is essential for implementing supportive interventions that address both the physical and psychological aspects of well-being [ 13 ].  Relationship and Fertility Concerns  The psychosocial impact of PCOS extends to interpersonal relationships, with potential ramifications on both romantic and familial connections. Fertility concerns, a common worry for individuals with PCOS, can strain relationships and contribute to emotional distress. The challenges associated with fertility treatments, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding conception, can further intensify the strain on relationships. Acknowledging and addressing the emotional toll on both individuals and their partners is crucial for providing holistic support and fostering open communication within relationships affected by PCOS [ 14 ].  The Link Between Hormonal Fluctuations and Mood  Hormonal fluctuations in PCOS, particularly irregular menstrual cycles, have been identified as strong predictors of mental health issues, including anxiety and depression [ 15 ]. The condition's symptoms, such as body hair and menstrual problems, have been found to strongly predict anxiety, while obesity is associated with hostility [ 15 ]. PCOS has significant mental health implications, including an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, as well as challenges related to body image, self-esteem, relationships, and fertility. Understanding and addressing these impacts are crucial for providing comprehensive care to individuals with PCOS.  Unraveling stigma: strategies for awareness and education  Public Awareness Campaigns  Public awareness campaigns play a pivotal role in dismantling the stigma surrounding PCOS by disseminating accurate information and fostering understanding.
