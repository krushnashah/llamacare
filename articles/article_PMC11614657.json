    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder that impacts 8-13% of women in their reproductive years ( 1 , 2 ). It is characterized by various clinical manifestations, including hyperandrogenism, irregular menstruation, anovulation, infertility, and polycystic ovaries ( 3 , 4 ). PCOS patients face an elevated risk of developing various diseases ( 5 \u2013 7 ). Although the exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood, it is believed to result from a\u00a0complex interplay of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Research suggests that hyperandrogenemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress are key contributors to the pathophysiology of PCOS\u00a0( 8 , 9 ).  Oxidative stress plays an essential role in the development and progression of PCOS and its associated complications ( 10 , 11 ). Oxidative stress arises when the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) surpasses the body\u2019s ability to defend itself with antioxidants ( 12 , 13 ). Key components involved in defending against oxidative stress include the antioxidant molecule glutathione and the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase ( 14 , 15 ). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is a nuclear receptor involved in various biological processes, including mitochondrial oxidative reactions, fatty acid oxidation, and glucose metabolism ( 16 , 17 ). Research indicates that PPAR-\u03b3 enhances the expression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, thereby strengthening antioxidant defenses ( 18 , 19 ). Additionally, PPAR-\u03b3 has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in PCOS ( 20 , 21 ). These findings indicate that it could be a promising therapeutic target for treating PCOS.  Curcumin, a yellow polyphenol derived from the rhizomes of turmeric, a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties ( 22 ). The antioxidant capacity of curcumin is underscored by its role in upregulating the expression of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase ( 22 , 23 ). Although curcumin\u2019s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects are well-documented, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms provide therapeutic benefits for PCOS, a condition characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. The drugs commonly used to treat PCOS are often prescribed off-label and may carry potential side effects. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of curcumin in managing PCOS and to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of new strategies for the treatment of PCOS.    2  Materials and methods   2.1  Experimental animals and treatments  The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College (Approval No. 2124131621). Eighteen female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, aged 6 weeks and weighing 174 \u00b1 8 g, were kept at our laboratory animal center at a temperature of 22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The rats were free to get food and water. Following a one-week acclimatization period, the rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 6) and an experimental group (n = 12).  The experimental group was administered a daily subcutaneous injection of 60 mg/kg body weight of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) dissolved in 100 \u03bcl sesame oil for 21 days to induce a PCOS model according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and previously published studies ( 24 , 25 ). The control group was subcutaneously injected with the same amount of vehicle sesame oil. The successful establishment of the PCOS model was confirmed based on established criteria ( 26 ). Subsequently, the experimental group was further divided into two subgroups: the PCOS group (n = 6) and the PCOS-curcumin group (n = 6). The PCOS-curcumin group received a daily intragastric dose of 50 mg/kg body weight of curcumin powder (Product No. PHR2209, Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) suspended in 200\u03bcl purified water lasted for 21 days. The control PCOS rat group received 200\u03bcl purified water by gavage. The experimental group was administered DHEA continuously for another 21 days while treated with curcumin.    2.2  Estrous cycle determination  Vaginal smears were collected daily at 09:00 AM, air-dried on glass slides, and stained with 0.1% methylene blue (Sigma, Chengdu, China). The slides were evaluated under a microscope (BX41, Olympus), and images were captured. The phases of the estrous cycle were identified using vaginal cytology: a predominance of nucleated epithelial cells indicated the proestrus stage, the presence of mostly cornified squamous epithelial cells signified the estrus stage, a mix of cornified squamous epithelial cells and leukocytes characterized the metestrus stage, and a predominance of leukocytes marked the diestrus stage ( 26 ).    2.3  Morphological evaluation of ovaries  The mice were euthanized and the ovaries were carefully dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight, and then embedded in paraffin blocks. The paraffin blocks were cut into 4 \u03bcm thick serial sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to standard histological examination protocols. The morphology of ovaries and the number of follicular cysts were evaluated under a microscope.    2.4  Serum analysis  To avoid the impact of different estrous cycle stages on the levels of serum hormones, blood samples were collected at diestrus from the caudal veins of rats and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes to separate the serum. The serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) were measured using commercial ELISA kits purchased from Cusabio Technology LLC, the product numbers were CSB-E12654r, CSB-E06869r, CSB-E05110r, and CSB-E05100r, respectively. Each serum sample was tested in triplicates. Insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated by the formula of fasting insulin (FIns, \u03bcU/ml) \u00d7 fasting blood glucose (FBG, mmol/L)/22.5 as described in the previously published study ( 27 ).    2.5  Western blot analysis  Proteins were extracted from ovarian tissues, and their concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit (Beyotime Biotechnology Inc., Shanghai, China). Each well was loaded with 15 \u03bcg of protein, which was then separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1.5% skimmed milk for one hour, followed by incubation with rabbit recombinant primary antibodies of anti-PPAR-\u03b3 (1:1000 dilution, ab316981, Abcam, Shanghai, China) and anti-GAPDH (1:1000 dilution, ab181602, Abcam, Shanghai, China) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After three 15-minute washes with phosphate-buffered saline with tween-20 (PBST), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution, ab205718, Abcam, Shanghai, China) for 2 hours at room temperature. The protein bands on the PVDF membranes were then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China). The quantitation of the proteins was determined by Image Lab 6.0 software.    2.6  Oxidative stress index analyses  The mice were euthanized, and ovarian tissues were harvested for oxidative stress index analyses. Oxidative stress markers, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured using the Reactive Oxygen Species Detection Assay Kit (ab186027, Abcam, Shanghai, China) and Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (ab233471, Abcam, Shanghai, China), respectively. Antioxidant markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Glutathione (GSH), were assessed using the Superoxide Dismutase Activity Assay Kit (ab65354, Abcam, Shanghai, China), Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit (ab102530, Abcam, Shanghai, China), and Glutathione Assay Kit (ab65322, Abcam, Shanghai, China), respectively. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.    2.7  Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 33.0 software. An unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare differences between the two groups. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.     3  Results   3.1  DHEA induced the PCOS model in rats  Normal control rats exhibit regular sequential estrous cycles that include the proestrus stage, estrus stage, metestrus stage, and diestrus stage. However, DHEA-treated rats didn\u2019t exhibit regular sequential estrous cycles, their estrous cycles were disrupted and stayed in the diestrus phase most of the time (  Figure\u00a01A  ). Vaginal smears revealed a predominance of leukocytes, with few keratinized epithelial cells observed, indicating anovulation in DHEA-treated rats (  Figure\u00a01B  ). Pathological examination showed an increased number of follicles with cystic dilation in the DHEA-treated rats, whereas the control group displayed a normal ovarian morphology (  Figure\u00a01C  ).

(C) the ovarian morphology of normal rats and PCOS model rats.     Additionally, we assessed the serum levels of sex hormones. Compared to the control group, the DHEA-treated rats showed significantly elevated levels of estradiol ( p = 0.001), luteinizing hormone ( p = 0.0001), testosterone ( p = 0.0001), and an increased LH/FSH ratio ( p = 0.002). In contrast, progesterone levels ( p = 0.01) were notably decreased. However, the two groups have no statistical difference in follicle-stimulating hormone levels ( p = 0.2) (  Figure\u00a02  ). These findings suggested that we successfully established a PCOS rat model.   Figure\u00a02   The sex hormone changes of normal rats and PCOS model rats (Control group: n=6, DHEA group: n=12).

The findings indicated that curcumin significantly reduced serum levels of estradiol ( p = 0.02), luteinizing hormone ( p = 0.009), testosterone ( p = 0.003), and the LH/FSH ratio ( p = 0.008) in PCOS rats. However, curcumin significantly increased serum progesterone levels ( p = 0.01) in these rats. Additionally, curcumin alleviated insulin resistance in PCOS rats (  Figure\u00a03  ).

After the curcumin treatment, the PCOS rats showed multiple corpus luteum and no polycystic changes (  Figure\u00a04B  ). After the curcumin treatment, the number of follicular cysts decreased significantly in the PCOS rat model (  Figure\u00a04C  ). The estrous cycles of PCOS rats were disrupted and stayed in the diestrus stage most of the time (  Figure\u00a04D  ). However, curcumin treatment restored the normal estrus cycles (  Figure\u00a04E  ).

The results showed that PCOS rats exhibited significantly increased levels of oxidative indicators, including ROS and malondialdehyde, along with decreased levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione in ovarian tissues. However, treatment with curcumin in PCOS rats significantly reduced ROS ( p = 0.005) and malondialdehyde ( p = 0.004) levels while increasing superoxide dismutase ( p = 0.04), glutathione peroxidase ( p = 0.002), and glutathione ( p = 0.02) levels in ovarian tissues (  Figure\u00a05  ). Additionally, we observed that the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 was significantly decreased in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats, but curcumin treatment significantly upregulated PPAR-\u03b3 expression (  Figure\u00a05  ).

While medications such as letrozole, clomiphene, and metformin are commonly used to manage PCOS symptoms, it is important to note that these drugs are often prescribed off-label and may carry potential side effects ( 28 ). As a result, there has been significant interest in developing new and more effective treatments for PCOS. Recently, studies have reported that traditional Chinese medicine and food-derived ingredients, such as allium extracts, soy isoflavones, and crocetin, have emerged as promising effectiveness for PCOS management ( 29 , 30 ). These findings suggested that botanical ingredients have the potential for further advancements in PCOS treatment options.  Curcumin has been extensively studied for its diverse biological activities, including potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties ( 22 , 31 ). This study demonstrated that curcumin alleviated insulin resistance and significantly reduced serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), and the LH/FSH ratio in PCOS rats. Additionally, curcumin restored normal ovarian morphologies and estrous cycles in these PCOS rats. Previous studies suggested that oxidative stress is a key contributor to the development and progression of PCOS and its associated complications. The therapeutic effectiveness of curcumin in PCOS rats may be due to its antioxidant ability to reduce oxidative stress.  Previous research has identified curcumin as a potent antioxidant, with its antioxidant properties attributed to the hydroxyl group and methylene group within its \u03b2-diketone structure ( 22 ). Under normal physiological conditions, various antioxidants protect the body from the damaging effects of oxidative stress. Known antioxidants include glutathione, vitamin E, catalase, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase ( 32 ). However, during oxidative stress, the levels of these antioxidants are reduced. In our study, PCOS rats exhibited significantly increased levels of oxidative indicators, including ROS and malondialdehyde, along with decreased levels of antioxidants such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in ovarian tissues. These findings suggest that the PCOS rats were in a state of oxidative stress. Treatment with curcumin in PCOS rats significantly reduced the levels of ROS and malondialdehyde while increasing the levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in ovarian tissues. These findings demonstrate that curcumin has decreased oxidative stress in PCOS rats.  Curcumin mitigates oxidative stress by upregulating PPAR-\u03b3 expression, a nuclear receptor integral to the regulation of inflammation, glucose metabolism, and lipid balance ( 16 , 17 , 33 ). Our research demonstrated that PPAR-\u03b3 expression was significantly reduced in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats, but treatment with curcumin significantly upregulated PPAR-\u03b3 expression. The precise mechanisms by which curcumin upregulates PPAR-\u03b3 expression are still unclear. Two possible scenarios exist: curcumin may bind to a specific receptor, forming a complex that promotes PPAR-\u03b3 upregulation, or curcumin might act directly on transcription factors to promote gene expression of PPAR-\u03b3. Despite this uncertainty, many studies have linked curcumin\u2019s ability to reduce oxidative stress to PPAR-\u03b3 upregulation ( 34 , 35 ). Furthermore, recent research has shown that curcumin exerts antitumor effects in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway ( 36 ). Therefore, it is plausible to propose that curcumin reduces oxidative stress in PCOS rats by upregulating PPAR-\u03b3 expression and subsequently inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.  Previous studies have shown that curcumin can reduce serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels while alleviating insulin resistance in PCOS rat models ( 37 ). Our research builds on these findings by demonstrating that curcumin also normalizes the estrous cycles and restores ovarian morphologies in PCOS rats. Additionally, our study provides novel insights by highlighting the crucial role of PPAR-\u03b3 in mediating curcumin\u2019s therapeutic effects on PCOS.  The study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the therapeutic effects of curcumin on PCOS rats were investigated only in vivo , so further in vitro studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Second, the research was conducted using 6-week-old rats, which do not represent the entire reproductive age population; further studies involving rats of varying ages are needed to confirm these findings. Finally, since this research was conducted using a PCOS rat model, cautions are needed before generalizing the findings to humans. Further randomized clinical trials are required to validate these findings in human populations.    5  Conclusions  In summary, this study demonstrates that curcumin effectively restores ovarian morphologies, hormone levels, and estrous cycles in PCOS rats. The findings suggest that curcumin\u2019s therapeutic effects in PCOS may be linked to its ability to reduce oxidative stress in ovaries through the upregulation of PPAR-\u03b3. Curcumin shows promise as a potential drug for the treatment of PCOS. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to understand their underlying mechanisms.",
