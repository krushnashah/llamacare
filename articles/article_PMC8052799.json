    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as one of the most\nprevalent disorders of the endocrine system is among the\nleading causes of non-ovulatory infertility. It is also the\nmain common endocrine, metabolic, and genetic disorder characterized by an ovulation, polycystic ovary, and\nbiochemical and clinical signs of hyper androgenism ( 1 ).\nPCOS is associated with adrenal-pituitary-hypothalamic\ndysregulations and is observed in about 4 to 18% of women of fertility age ( 2 ).  PCOS women have higher levels of luteinizing hormone\n(LH), testosterone (T), cholesterol, and triglycerides but\nin contrast, they have lower levels of follicle stimulating\nhormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),\nand high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) ( 2 ). The most common complications of PCOS are non-ovulation, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and menstrual disorders,\nwhich can lead to infertility if remain untreated. In PCOS\nwomen, the functions of both insulin and its receptor are\nnormal; however the signaling cascade activated following the binding of insulin to its receptor, is impaired ( 3 ).\nFurthermore, apoptosis of granulosa cells, which is an essential process for the normal development of follicles,\nhas been highlighted in the pathogenesis of PCOS ( 4 ).  PCOS treatment includes medications such as medroxyprogesterone, cyproterone acetate, spironolactone,\nmetformin (MET), and birth control pills. MET as one\nof the drugs used in diabetes, has recently been applied\nto treat PCOS, as it improves menstruation and ovulation\npatterns within 2 to 3 months ( 5 ). In addition to chemical\ndrugs, many herbal/traditional remedies are now used to\nrelieve PCOS symptoms. Herbal and natural compounds have wide popularity because of their lower side effects,\nand greater compatibility with the body, as well as their\nextensive variety.  Bee pollen (BP) is a circular seed-like particle (2.5-250\n\u03bcm diameter) covered by a protective wall and contains\nsignificant amounts of proteins, lecithin, active enzymes,\nfolic acid, vitamins, especially B family, and other minerals. Bees combine small volumes of their saliva with pollens accumulated from plants, to produce bee bread. The\nproduct of this process is stored in corbiculae on the dorsal\ntibia. Based on plant species, pollens show variable morphological shapes. Furthermore, their color is variable from\nlight yellow to black. Regarding the size, pollens may be\nseen as grains of ten to hundreds of micrograms. The beneficial effects of this compound on prostate inflammation,\ncancer, chronic alcoholic disease, burn wounds, and depression have been recognized ( 6 ).  Various studies have shown that BP has many valuable effects in improving infertility,\nallergies, and obesity ( 7 - 9 ). BP is a potential source of natural antioxidants including\nvanillic, protocatechuic acid, gallic, and p-Coumaric acid as well as flavonoids such as\nhesperidin, rutin, kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, and isorametin ( 10 ). These\ncompounds have shown antioxidant activity by inactivating and removing free radicals and\nreactive oxygen species (ROS such as H 2 O 2, O 2 \u2022- and\n\u2022OH). Accordingly, \u0160ari\u0107 et al. ( 11 ) attributed the potent antioxidant effects of BP to its\nphenolic compounds such as quercetin, isorhamnetin, galangin, chrysin, and pinocembrin. In\nanother study, Sousa et al. ( 12 ) stated that anti-oxidative components of BP, especially\ncyanidine and kaempferol, inhibited CYPs, and protected Caco-2 enterocyte intestinal cells\nagainst tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)- induced oxidative stress. Given the aforementioned\nand unique properties of BP, and the fact that the effects of BP on PCOS have not been\ninvestigated yet, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of BP alone and in\ncombination with MET on sex hormone levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and expression\nof anti- and pro-apoptotic genes, in a rat model of PCOS.    Materials and Methods   Animals  In this animal experimental study, 54 mature female\nWistar rats (180-210 g) were maintained under standard\nlaboratory conditions (22-24\u00b0C and12-hour dark-light cycle) and they had free access to food and water ad libitum.\nRats were selected based on two to three regular estrous\nperiods during 8-10 days of vaginal smear evaluation\n( 13 ). BP was collected from beehives in East Azerbaijan\nprovince, Iran. It was dissolved in distilled water (DW)\n(5 g in 20 ml) by stirring for 2 hours. After filtration, the\nsuspension was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes\nand the supernatant was kept in the freezer until use. Before analysis, the suspension was thawed and dissolved\nin DW. Body weight was measured at the binging and the\nend of the experimental period. Also, all experimental\nprocedures in this study were reviewed and approved with\nthe Guidelines of the Ethical Committee for Research on\nLaboratory Animals at Kermanshah University and Medical Sciences (IR.KUMS.REC.1398.496).    Polycystic ovary syndrome induction  PCOS was induced by a single intramuscular injection\nof estradiol valerate (EV, 2 mg dissolved in 0.2 ml olive\noil) (Aburaihan, Iran). During the 60 days of the study,\nvaginal smears were obtained to determine abnormal estrous cycle and persistent vaginal cornification (PVC) and\nirregularity of the estrous cycle ( 14 ). Furthermore, to establish a PCOS diagnosis, 6 rats were selected randomly\nand the levels of E2 and T were measured.    Treatment groups  The rats were divided into 9 groups (n=6/group) as\nfollows: 1: Control, 2: PCOS (without intervention), 3-5:\nPCOS with BP at the doses of 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg,\n6: PCOS with MET (300 mg/kg) ( 15 ), and 7-9: PCOS\nwith MET 300 (mg/kg)+50, 100, or 200 mg/kg BP. All the\ntreatments were performed for 21 days by gavage ( 16 ).    Serum analysis  At the end of the study, rats were sacrificed under general anesthesia induced by 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10\nmg/kg xylazine (Alfasan, Warden-Holland) (intraperitoneally) ( 17 ). The blood samples were taken from the\nhearts and the serum was isolated (3000 rpm for 15 minutes) and stored at -20\u00b0C. Then, the levels of E2 and T\nwere measured using rat ELISA Kits (ZellBio, Germany,\nHistogenotech, testosterone: ZB-10259C, estradiol: ZB10176C). TAC of serum was measured by the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) method as explained in\nour previous studies ( 18 ).    Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  The right ovaries were removed and stored in liquid\nnitrogen for gene expression analysis. The ovarian tissue\n(30 mg) was used to extract total RNA by a kit protocol\n(BioFact kit, South Korea, Noavaranteb, PR101-050/\nPR101-100). The quality of the RNA was checked by\nNanoDrop spectrophotometers 2000c (Thermo Science,\nUSA) and determining the absorbance ratios of A260/\nA280 and A260/A230 nm. The DNA was synthesized\nusing the BioFact kit (BioFact RT Series, South Korea,\nNoavaranteb, BR63110-96). The reaction mixture was\nprepared in a net volume of 20 \u03bcL. The polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) master mix of SYBR Green I (TaKaRa,\nSouth Korea, Noavaranteb, DQ385-40H) was added to\nthe reactions tube (10 \u03bcL). Other constituents of the reaction mixture included forward (1 \u03bcL) and reverse (1\n\u03bcL) primers (400 nM), cDNA (1 \u03bcL), and ddH2O (7\n\u03bcL). The primers were designed using Gene Runner and\nPrimer Express software v.3.0 (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, USA) and blasted in NCBI ( Table 1 ). Realtime PCR thermal program consisted of an initial incubation at 70\u00b0C for 45 minutes. Then, 38 to 42 cycles\nwere considered [95\u00b0C for 30 seconds 60\u00b0C (annealing\nand extension) for 1 minutes]. Melting curve analysis\nwas carried out between 60 and 95\u00b0C (1\u00b0C increments)\nfor 5 s at each step.

Data analysis was done\nby SPSS-16 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nand data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The GraphPad\nPrism software package version 8 (Graph Pad Prism\nSoftware Inc., San Diego, California) was used to draw\ndata charts.

Sex hormones  PCOS induction by EV significantly increased the\nserum levels of E2 and T while their levels in the treatment\ngroups reduced (P<0.01). The E2 levels were significantly\nlower in all groups treated with 50 (P=0.01), 100\n(P=0.005) and 200 (P=0.001) mg/kg BP, and combination\nof 50 (P=0.005), 100 (P=0.003) and 200 (P=0.001) mg/\nkg of BP with MET compared to the PCOS group. E2\nreached the control level in the group treated with 50 mg/\nkg BP+MET. Although, the group treated with 200 mg/kg\nBP+MET showed a significant increase compared to the\ncontrol group (P=0.007, Fig.2A ).  While T level significantly increased in the PCOS group,\nit decreased by BP alone or in combination with MET\ndose-dependently (P<0.05). MET treatment reduced T\nlevel (P<0.01), but it did not reach the control level. The\ngroup treated with 50 mg/kg BP showed no significant\ndifference compared to the PCOS group (P=0.3), but the\ngroup treated with 100 (P=0.006) and 200 mg/kg (P=0.001)\nof BP had significant differences ( Fig.1B ). Furthermore, in\nrats treated with a combination of BP and MET, T level\nsignificantly decreased (P=0.001) and it reached the control\nlevel in 200 mg/kg+MET group ( Fig.2B ).

In all treated PCOS groups with BP or\nBP+MET, it significantly increased in a dose-dependent\nmanner (P<0.01). Its elevation did not reach the control\nlevels in the group treated with BP alone, but it was higher\nthan control in rats treated with combinations of MET\nand BP [(100 mg/kg (P=0.03), and 200 mg/kg (P=0.006)\ngroups]. TAC level also significantly increased in rats\ntreated with MET (P=0.03) ( Fig.3 ).    Genes expressions  The expression of Bax gene was significantly reduced in the PCOS group (P=0.001), it\nexpression significantly increased in the both BP-treated groups (P<0.001). The Bax\nexpression in the groups treated with 50 mg/kg BP+MET (P=0.002), 100 mg/kg BP+MET, 200\nmg/kg BP+MET, and MET alone was increased significantly compared to the PCOS group\n(P<0.001, Fig.4A ). The expression of Bcl-2 gene was significantly\nelevated in the PCOS group (P=0.007), it significantly decreased in the groups treated\nwith 100 mg/kg BP (P=0.007), 200 mg/kg BP (P=0.007), MET (P<0.01), and combination\nof MET and BP (50,100 and 200 mg/kg, P<0.01) compared to the PCOS group\n( Fig.4B ).

Discussion  BP alone and in combination with MET significantly reduced the levels of T, body weight and Bcl-2 gene expressions, and increased E2 and TAC significantly, as well\nas expressions of Bax , Caspase-3 , and Sirt-1 genes in the PCOS treated group. In this study, higher BP doses\nwere more effective. Changes in the levels of Bax , TAC, and T were\nsignificant for 100 and 200 mg/kg BP doses. Examining apoptotic markers and sex hormones\nindicated the beneficial effects of the 200 mg/kg BP.  Women with PCOS have abnormal androgen and\nE2 production, which depends on the extent of LH\nstimulation. BP exerts E2-like activity due to the presence\nof phytosterols such as P- and \u03b2-sitosterol ( 19 ). These\nare cholesterol-like compounds that can interfere with\ncholesterol uptake and therefore, reduce synthesis of\nandrogenic hormones, especially T ( 20 ). Steroid hormones\nproduced by ovaries act as autocrine factors and play an\nimportant role in controlling ovarian cell death. E2 acts as\nan key factor for the survival of both granulosa cells and\ncorpus luteum. Progesterone also maintains the survival\nof granulosa cells. Although the mechanism of action of\nsteroid hormones is not completely understood, they can\npartly act through inducing the production of BCL-2 ( 21 ).\nIncreased anti-apoptotic factors lead to the preservation\nof ovarian cysts and the progression of PCOS ( 22 ). In\nthis syndrome, high levels of estrogen prevent apoptosis,\nwhich is a feature of PCOS. In the intervention groups, BP\ntreatment reduced E2 levels and the expressions of antiapoptotic genes, while increased the expressions of proapoptotic genes, which subsequently can induce apoptosis\nin ovarian cysts and mitigate PCOS manifestations.  A mutation in the aromatase P450 enzyme can lead to\novarian dysfunction and increased androgens\u2019 levels as a\ntrigger factor for PCOS. The aromatase enzyme catalyzes\nE2 biosynthesis from androgens ( 23 ). \u03b2-sitosterol inhibits\nthe activity of cytochrome P450 in the microsomes of\nhuman liver, inhibiting the conversion of cholesterol to\npregnenolone and other steroid hormones ( 24 ). Malini\nand Vanithakumari ( 25 ) showed that \u03b2-sitosterol reduced\nthe production of cholesterol and gonadal steroids.\nConsistent with these studies, our results also suggested\nthat BP can reduce production of steroid hormones\nprobably by \u03b2-sitosterol. Body weight might be one of\nthe main clinical features of PCOS patients ( 26 ). In this\nstudy, it was observed that BP and MET reduce the weight\nof rats and ovaries.  BP is a phenolic-rich compounds with anti-androgenic\nproperties ( 27 ) and suppresses the binding of dehydrotestosterone to its receptor, leading to reduced T secretion.\nFlavonols are structurally similar to E2, so it is hypothesized\nthat these compounds may compete with androgens for\nbinding to receptors, affecting internal androgen levels.\nOther flavonols are apigenin and kaemferol; apigenin is\nan anti-androgenic compound with inhibitory effects on\ncytochrome P450 activity ( 28 ). It reduced T secretion in\nthe adrenal cortex ( 29 ). Apigenin is also present in BP\nwhich can explain anti-estrogenic effects ( 30 ) observed in\nthe present study.  In the study of Wang et al. ( 31 ), apigenin competitively\ninhibited the binding of flunitrazepamto the GABA receptor\nand reduced the LH secretion. Furthermore, researchers\nhave shown that kaempferol can promote E2-like activities\n( 27 ). It can inhibit the binding of E2 to alpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP), a serum estradiol-binding protein. The interaction\nof biological flavonoids with AFP can limit the availability\nof E2 for binding to target cells ( 32 ). In the present study,\ninhibition of E2 binding to AFP by BP ingredients, can\nexplain E2 reduction in PCOS rats. Monsefi et al. ( 33 ) also\nshowed that kaempferol available in Anethum graveolens\nreduced E2 level through binding to AFP.  BP also significantly increased TAC in the treatment\ngroups. Murri et al. ( 34 ) reported abnormal levels of\ncirculating markers of oxidative stress in women with\nPCOS proposing a role for these markers in PCOS\npathophysiology. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between\nROS production and antioxidant system activity. A\nvariety of female reproductive functions can be disturbed\nby the effect of oxidative mediators. The most important\nof such results is abnormal maturation of oocytes, as well\nas disturbances in ovulation ( 35 ). The normal growth of\nthe inner theca layer is essential for ovarian function.\nFree radicals and oxidative mediators can disrupt regular\ngrowth and induce apoptosis in this layer. In PCOS women,\na direct relationship has been shown between decreased\noxidative stress and increased oocyte maturation ( 36 ). So,\nantioxidants can help improving PCOS symptoms ( 10 ).  We also investigated the effect of BP on the gene expressions of anti-apoptotic\n( Bcl-2 ) and proapoptotic ( Bax and Caspase-3 ) markers. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to\ndate on the effects of BP on apoptosis of ovarian cells in PCOS. In this study, while\nanti-apoptotic genes were reduced, pro-apoptotic genes were increased in the PCOS group\nwhich was consistent with previous studies. Das et al. ( 37 ) reported that the expressions of\npro-apoptotic genes: including Bax were significantly reduced in PCOS\nwomen. On the other side, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly\nelevated in these patients indicating a low rate of apoptosis in their ovarian cysts.\nLikewise, Isobe and Yoshimura ( 38 ) showed that the expressions of caspase-3 and BAX was\nsignificantly reduced in bovine cystic ovarian disease.  In another report, Salvetti et al. ( 22 ) investigated the\nproliferation and apoptosis rates, as well as the levels of\nsome proteins (i.e. BAX, BCL-xL, BCL-w, and BCL-2)\ninvolved in these processes in different types of ovarian\nfollicles in PCOS rats. They asserted that the reduced\napoptosis in follicles of these rats can be involved in the\nformation and persistence of ovarian cysts. These findings\nindicate the roles of BCL-2 and BAX in apoptosis of\novarian granulosa cells in PCOS. In parallel, we also\nobserved decreased levels of apoptotic markers in ovaries\nin a rat model of PCOS induced by injection of EV.  During the development of the female reproductive system, apoptotic cell death shares a\nsubstantial role in the normal formation of ovarian follicles. Follicular granulosa cell\napoptosis occurs at childbearing age. These cells are the same cells affected in women with\nPCOS. BCL-2 inhibits apoptosis through suppressing the release of caspase-9 by reducing the\npermeability of the mitochondrial membrane. On the other hand, the pro-apoptotic BAX\ncounteracts the function of BCL-2 by facilitating the release of cytochrome c and other\napoptotic mediators from mitochondria through increasing the permeability of its outer\nmembrane. The balance of antiand pro-apoptotic mediators is the main regulator of apoptosis\nin granulosa cells during ovary development and atresia through suppressing caspase-3\nactivity. According to studies, targeting apoptotic pathways may be a new approach for\ntreating PCOS. In the present study, BP significantly increased apoptosis in granulosa\ncells. Our results showed that Sirt-1 expression significantly increased in\nthe BP-treated groups. Sirt-1 is an NADdependent histone deacetylase, which\ncan improve insulin sensitivity and insulin signal transduction pathways, in\ninsulin-sensitive organs and tissues. Decreased Sirt-1 expression may be\nrelated to the pathogenesis of diseases associated with insulin resistance ( 39 ).  Although the underlying causes of the disease remain\nunknown, it is believed that insulin resistance plays a key\nrole in the development of PCOS. Recent studies have\nshown that insulin receptors in skeletal muscles and skin\nfibroblasts are serine phosphorylated in at least 50% of\nwomen with PCOS. Serine phosphorylation regulates\nthe activity of P450. Its aberrant expression triggers\ninsulin resistance and induces elevation of Androgens.\nThis phenomenon, in turn, increases insulin level and\nAndrogen production within ovaries causing premature\novarian atresia and impair ovulation. MET is a drug used\nto treat non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This\ndrug decreases insulin and LH levels by suppressing\nhepatic gluconeogenesis and inducing peripheral glucose\nuptake ( 40 ).    Conclusion  BP exerts positive effects either individually or\nsynergistically with MET, on E2, T, TAC of serum, and\nexpression of apoptotic genes. BP increased apoptosis in\novarian cysts due to its phytoestrogenic properties. Higher\nBP doses were more advantageous in this study and\nproducedmore significant changes. Based on the presence\nof various antioxidants, phytoestrogens, and phenolic\ncompounds, BP could be used as a potential therapeutic\nagent to treat PCOS.",
