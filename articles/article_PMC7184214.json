    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a leading cause of infertility in women worldwide and is an endocrine disorder that affects 15\u201320% of the female population at reproductive age. It is caused by an imbalance in the female reproductive system, which manifests as an excess of androgen, irregular menstrual cycles, ovulatory dysfunction, hirsutism, subfertility, anovulatory infertility, polycystic ovary morphology, and weight gain. 1 , 2 , 3 First described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, 4 there is no solid evidence to indicate the cause of PCOS, but scientist believes that a high level of androgen and endogenous hormones could be the reason behind this disease. 5 In PCOS, oestrogen dominance can arise from hyperandrogenism. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 Research studies have revealed that women with PCOS have metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and genetics problems. 11 , 12 , 13 Ovarian function is affected by elevated luteinising hormone levels and hyperandrogenism, which leads to premature granulosa cell luteinisation and meiosis. Consequentially, the growth of antral follicles is arrested, and oocyte quality degrades. 14 , 15 Mild PCOS is associated with normal ovulation and hyperandrogenism. This can progress to full PCOS over time when progesterone biosynthesis is affected and follicular oestrogen is produced. 16 .  Current treatments for PCOS have substantial side-effects such as joint and muscle pain, and arthritis, which decreases the quality of life for patients, and there is no definite cure for this disease. 17 , 18 Furthermore, most of these treatments focused on managing the symptoms instead of curing the disease. 19 Therefore, there is a need to find effective treatment in natural products, which can have fewer side-effects. 20 , 21 In the last two decades, armed with extensive knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease, researchers worldwide have focused on identifying PCOS treatments from natural medicines.  Prunus dulcis is a dry fruit that is used by a diverse number of ethnic groups for various ailments. 22 People from 7000 BC have often used this as one of the key ingredients in traditional and alternative medicine. 23 It contains secondary metabolites, including polyphenolic compounds such as terpenes, tannins, and essential oils, 24 which have a variety of biological activities against inflammation, 25 atherosclerosis, 26 and oxidative damage. 27  Salvia hispenica is an oilseed plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. 28 The plant is native to Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, and Australia, 29 and contains many health-related substances such as phenolic compounds, dietary fibre, alpha-linolenic acid, vitamins, and proteins. 30 As S.\u00a0hispenica has a number of different secondary metabolites, it is known to have significant antimicrobial, 31 antioxidant, 32 anti-cancer, 33 and pro-neurological properties. 34 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica, as either single agents or in combination, have an effect against the PCOS induced by letrozole in a rat model. This report suggests that these compounds are effective treatments for PCOS with fewer side-effects and is an important milestone in the development of naturally-derived PCOS treatments.    Materials and Methods   Collection of materials  Good quality P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica were procured from a local Ayurvedic supplier in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh in February 2018.   Drugs and chemicals  Letrozole (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, India) and clomiphene citrate (Aventis, India) tablets were purchased from a local pharmacy in Rajahmundry.    Experimental animals  Virgin adult female Wistar albino rats (160\u2013200\u00a0g) were procured from the Sainath Agencies, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. The animals were housed and maintained under standard laboratory conditions: in controlled temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C), humidity (55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%), and a 12\u00a0h light/dark cycle. The animals had ad libitum access to a standard rat pellet diet and water. 35 , 36 The experiment protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee at GIET School of Pharmacy in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, India (GSP/IAEC/2017/03/03). All experimental animals were sacrificed using diethyl ether, and their ovaries were harvested.      Experimental method  Experimental animals that were induced to undergo PCOS by letrozole were fed P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica . Animals were initially divided into six groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06): a negative control, a positive control (placebo), a standard, and three treatment groups. Group 1 (negative control) was given daily oral doses of 1\u00a0mg/kg in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for 21 days. The remaining animals were administered with 1\u00a0mg/kg letrozole daily for 21 days to induce PCOS, 37 and were further divided into five groups. Group 2 rats were the positive control group and were administered with 40\u00a0g of placebo. Groups 3\u20135 were the treatment groups, with group 3 receiving an oral dose of S.\u00a0hispenica (40\u00a0g/day); group 4, an oral dose of P.\u00a0dulcis (40\u00a0g/day); and group 5, an oral combination of P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica (20\u00a0g each). A sixth group was also administered with an oral dose of clomiphene citrate at 1\u00a0mg/kg in 0.5% CMC (standard group). Other than group 1, all groups were treated with their respective treatments for 15 days (from day 22\u201336). The animals were anaesthetised and sacrificed with diethyl ether at the end of the experiment, and the organs were extracted to assess for various morphological, biochemical, histopathological investigations. 38   Morphological parameters   Body weight measurements  Animal body weight was measured by placing the animal on a weighing scale. The body weight of individual rats was recorded on day 1 and 37 as a difference in weight between these two days. 39    Ovarian weight measurements  The ovaries were removed after the rats were euthanised and dissected, and were washed thoroughly with 0.9% saline solution to remove the uterine tissue. The ovaries were then weighed with a weighing balance. 40    Biochemical analysis  Blood samples were collected from the experimental rats by retro-orbital puncture 24\u00a0h after the last dose of treatment and stored in Eppendorf tubes containing heparin sodium for further processing. The plasma samples for hormone assays were separated by centrifugation at 3000\u00a0rpm/min for 15\u00a0min and stored in a freezer at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. The oestradiol and testosterone levels were determined by a chemiluminescent immunoassay method using a commercially available kit (Siemens, New York, NY, USA, mean inter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.4% and 6.2%, respectively). To measure the plasma progesterone and cholesterol levels, we used a microparticle enzyme immunoassay and a method published by Azeez et\u00a0al., 41 using a commercially available kit (Court-Acount progesterone; Los Angles, California, USA, mean inter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 14.4% and 4.9%, respectively). All blood sample measurements were recorded twice: 21 days after letrozole induction (that is, on the 22nd day of the study) and 15 days following treatment with P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica (that is, on the 37th day of study). 42    Histopathological examinations  All rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment according to the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals as per Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) guidelines, and the ovaries were extracted, cleansed to remove fat, and weighed. Histopathological examination of these ovaries was carried out as per the standard procedure. Ovary sections were prepared from paraffin-embedded blocks and were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Light microscopy was used to examine these sections. 43    Statistical analysis  Results were statistically assessed by paired t-test and one-way ANOVA. The results of the treatment groups were compared to control and standard groups, respectively. 44 , 45      Results   Body weight  Animals were weighed at the beginning of, and upon completion of the experiment (on the 37th day of the experiment), and expressed as a difference in body weight between these two days. The body weights of experimental animals decreased significantly after single or combination treatment with P.\u00a0dulcis and/or S.\u00a0hispenica . The body weight results are summarized in Table\u00a01 . Table\u00a01 The body weight of experimental animals before and after administration of Prunus dulcis and Salvia hispenica.

Hormone profile  The experimental rats treated with P.\u00a0dulcis and/or S.\u00a0hispenica, and these rats produced testosterone and oestradiol within the normal ranges. Whereas, progesterone levels were lower in the letrozole-treated PCOS groups (groups 2\u20136) than in the negative control group. These natural products also affected the cholesterol level in these animals. The hormone levels of all animals tested are summarised in Table\u00a03 .

Statistical analysis-One way ANOVA.    Histopathological studies  Transverse sections of the left and right ovaries were prepared and were histopathologically studied. The ovaries extracted from the negative control group had healthy follicles at various stages of maturation and were surrounded by a thick ovarian stroma and corpus luteum ( Fig 1 A). Letrozole causes tissue damage, inducing the formation of free radicals, which lead to the development of polycystic ovaries in the experimental animals. In the positive control group, this is demonstrated by the appearance of multiple cystic follicles lined by a thin granulosa layer, follicular atresia, stromal hyperplasia, and vacuolated stroma ( Fig 1 B). Prunus dulcis treatment reversed some of these follicular changes, with smaller cysts and fewer pyknotic granulosa cells ( Fig 1 C). In rats treated with Salvia hispenica , the effect of letrozole was completely reversed, with ovaries that had healthy-looking follicles and stroma ( Fig 1 D). Interestingly, this morphological reversal correlated with that of progesterone and oestrogen levels, which also returned to normal ranges. These effects were comparable to those observed in the rats treated with the standard drug (clomiphene citrate), which is known to mask letrozole's effect ( Fig 1 E).     Discussion  This study was designed to identify the effect of P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica in the management of PCOS in rats. In this study, letrozole was used to induce PCOS in the experimental animals. Clomiphene citrate, which reverses letrozole's effect, was used as a marker to assess the effectiveness of the test compounds. Both letrozole and clomiphene citrate were prepared in 0.5% CMC and administered orally at a dose of 1\u00a0mg/kg as per published protocol. To induce PCOS, letrozole was administered to all rats for 21 days except those belonging to the negative control group (group 1). Group 2 animals were the positive controls for this experiment. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were given a daily dose of P.\u00a0dulcis (40\u00a0g/kg), S.\u00a0hispenica (40\u00a0g/kg), or a combination of both (20\u00a0g/kg each) respectively, for 15 days. Group 6 animals were treated with clomiphene citrate. After drug treatment, the body and ovarian weights, hormone levels, and the histopathological changes were measured from animals sacrificed on the 37th day of the experiment.  The results revealed that feeding rats with these natural compounds, either individually or in combination, significantly reduced the body weight of the experimental animals. The results revealed that feeding rats with these natural compounds reversed the effect of letrozole when PCOS was induced. This include a reduction of the body and ovarian weight gained from 199.83 \u00b1 4.55, 57.5067 \u00b1 1.1324 and 57.4583 \u00b1 1.0989. The rats that were treated with a combination of both S.\u00a0hispenica and P.\u00a0dulcis exhibited a reduction of 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\u00a0g in body weight, which was comparable to the clomiphene citrate-treated group. Furthermore, S.\u00a0hispenica (Group 3) or P.\u00a0dulcis (Group 4) treatments alone considerably increased the body weight of these rats by 14.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.97\u00a0g and 15.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.06\u00a0g, respectively. These results are summarised in Table\u00a01 .  Experimental animals were sacrificed on the 37th day of the experiment, and the left and right ovaries were extracted and weighed. The result showed that ovaries extracted from the combined-treatment animals did not form cysts, therefore the mean ovarian weight was 57.5067 \u00b1 1.1324 (left) and 57.4583 \u00b1 1.0989 (right). These values were similar to those of the negative control group. In animals that were treated with either compound, an ovarian mean weight of 58.7350 \u00b1 1.3951, 58.8217 \u00b1 1.2856 ( S.\u00a0hispenica ) and and 60.0033 \u00b1 1.2965, 60.1827 \u00b1 1.0246 ( P.\u00a0dulcis ) was observed. The weights of both ovaries are summarised in Table\u00a02 .  At the end of the study, hormone levels and histopathological changes were measured when the animals were sacrificed. In the letrozole-treated rats, both testosterone and oestradiol concentrations increased, whereas progesterone levels were reduced. Combination treatment with P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica restored hormone levels to normal in these animals because these products contained polyphenolic compounds. These plant products protect the ovaries from the harmful effects of letrozole, resulting in healthy ovarian stroma. Both hormone levels and histopathology of experimental animals are summarised in Table\u00a03 and Figure\u00a01 . Similar results were also obtained in studies conducted by other scientists, who found that P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica were responsible for alleviating ovarian dysfunction by improving metabolic and endocrine parameters in tested animals. 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 Because of these benefits, natural compounds should be considered as viable treatment options for PCOS and other emerging diseases. These natural compounds should be further researched to investigate their role in the management of PCOS and other hormone-related diseases caused by the modern lifestyle.

Figure\u00a01     Conclusion  Our study demonstrated that individual or combined treatment with P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica improves ovarian functions in letrozole-induced PCOS rats. Letrozole-induction is an accurate method to induce PCOS in experimental animals. These natural products contain polyphenolic compounds, which are the active ingredients to treat metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions. Therefore, hormone levels are restored in these experimental animals. Thus, P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica are promising agents for the management of PCOS and other metabolic disorders in women.    Recommendation  We recommend that further studies should be carried out on the therapeutic activities of P.\u00a0dulcis and S.\u00a0hispenica as we have shown that they have significant effects against metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions by restoring normal hormone levels without producing side-effects.
