    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of\nthe most common gynecological endocrinopathy\namong reproductive-aged women ( 1 , 2 ). The\nprevalence of PCOS have been reported from 2.2\nto 26% in different studies conducted in various\ncountries, depending on sampling method , the criteria\nused for its definition and the method used to\ndefine each criterion ( 1 - 3 ). The clinical and biochemical\nfeatures of PCOS may vary according\nto race, ethnicity and the diagnostic criteria used\n( 4 ). In a study by Tehrani et al. ( 3 ), the prevalence\nof PCOS in a community sample of Iranian population\nwas 7.1% using the National Institute of\nHealth (NIH) definition, 11.7% by the Androgen\nExcess Society (AES) criteria and 14.6% using the\nRotterdam consensus definition. The classic form\nof PCOS is characterized by chronic anovulation\n(oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), hyperandrogenism,\ninfertility, hirsutism, obesity and enlarged bilateral\novaries with cysts ( 5 - 7 ). The pathogenesis\nof PCOS is not fully understood, although genetic,\nmetabolic and neuroendocrine interactions as well\nas environmental factors were discussed elsewhere\n( 8 - 11 ). Alterations in several metabolic pathways\nsuch as steroid hormone regulation and insulin\nsignaling pathway abnormalities were discussed\nin the pathophysiology of PCOS ( 12 - 14 ). More\nthan 50 percent of women with PCOS are obese or\noverweight that may predispose them to metabolic\ndisorders ( 15 ).  The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is one type of\nendocrine disturbance that consists of insulin resistance,\ndyslipidemia, obesity, central adiposity,\nand hypertension that has been shown to be associated\nwith a two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular\ndisease and a five-fold increased risk of type\n2 diabetes ( 16 ). The prevalence of MetS in PCOS\nhas been studied in different populations ( 16 - 19 ).\nIn a study conducted in the USA showed that the\nprevalence of MetS in PCOS women was approximately\n43 to 46%, while for aged-matched women\nin the general population, it was nearly 2-fold\nhigher ( 16 ). However, the findings of several studies\nconducted in Iran regarding the prevalence of\nMetS in PCOS women were controversial ( 18 - 20 ).\nHosseinpanah et al. ( 18 ) showed that MetS was\nless frequent in patients with PCOS. However, in\nother studies, MetS was noted in younger PCOS\npatients in comparison with older PCOS women\n( 19 , 20 ). These controversial data indicate the need\nfor more investigation of MetS characteristics in\nPCOS patients in our population, as it may help in\nplanning screening strategies to prevent long-term\neffects ( 17 ). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate\nthe clinical and laboratory characteristics and\nmetabolic features of patients with PCOS in Rasht,\nNorth of Iran.    Materials and Methods  This prospective cross sectional study was conducted\non 215 PCOS women aged 15-35 years\nwho were referred to private and public gynecological\nendocrinology clinics, Rasht, north of Iran,\nfrom March 2010 to July 2012. The exclusion\ncriteria were as follows: lactating and pregnant\nwomen, previous history of ovarian surgery, use\nof steroid hormone drugs such as oral contraceptive\npill and progesterone for past 6 months, use\nof dyslipidemia drugs for last 3 months, and use of\nany medications known to affect glucose metabolism\nor BP. Furthermore women with following\nconditions were excluded: hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia,\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-\nproducing tumor, and Cushing\u2019s syndrome\nthat were diagnosed by physical examination and\nlaboratory testing using serum levels of thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), and\n17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17a-OHP). All patients\nprovided a written informed consent before entering\nthe study. The participants were then divided\ninto two groups of women with MetS (n=62) and\nwomen without MetS (n=153). The study protocol\nwas approved by the Ethics Committee of Guilan\nUniversity of medical sciences, Rasht, Iran.  The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam\n2003 criteria, in which any two of the following\nthree conditions need to be fulfilled for the\ninclusion: i. Oligo- and/or anovulation (i.e. less\nthan 9 menstrual periods in a year or menstrual\ncycles more than 35 days in length), ii. Clinical\nhyperandrogenism (i.e. acne or hirsutism; modified\nFerriman-Gallwey scores \u22658) or biochemical\nhyperandrogenism [i.e. free testosterone (FT)\n\u22657.0 pg/ml], and iii. Ultrasonographic findings of\npolycystic ovarian morphology (presence of \u226512\nfollicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter).\nBased on these criteria, four phenotypes\nwere formed as follows: type 1 including irregular\nmenstruation+PCO using ultrasonographic examination+hyperandrogenism (IM+PCO+HA), type\n2 including irregular menstruation+PCO using ultrasonographic\nexamination (IM+PCO), type 3 including\nirregular menstruation+hyperandrogenism\n(IM+HA) and type 4 including PCO using ultrasonographic\nexamination+hyperandrogenism (PCO+HA).  MetS was defined according to the Adult Treatment\nPanel III (ATP III) criteria as the co-occurrence\nof three or more of the following risk factors:\ni. Central obesity with waist circumference (WC)\n\u226588 cm in women, ii. Elevated systolic blood pressure\n(SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)\nof \u2265130/85 mmHg, iii. Impaired level of fasting\nblood sugar (FBS) \u2265110 mg/dL, iv. Elevated level\nof fasting serum triglycerides (Tg) \u2265150 mg/dL\nand v. Fasting high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\nlevel <50 mg/dL.  Anthropometric measurements included height\nin centimeters, weight in kilograms, and hip and\nwaist circumference in centimeters according to\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) categories.\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by the square of height in meters\n(kg/m 2 ). Underweight was defined as less than\n18.5 (normal range between 18.5 and 24.9), overweight\nbetween 25.0 and 29.9 and obese as 30.0 or\nhigher. Sitting blood pressure was measured after a\n5-minute rest using a standard sphygmomanometer.  After 12 hours fasting during days 3-5 of menstrual\ncycle, 10 cc of blood sample was obtained.\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing\nhormone (LH) levels were measured using\nAccess Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter,\nFullerton, California, USA); FT, dehydroepiandrosterone\nsulfate (DHEAS), and 17a-OHP levels\nusing radio-immunometric assay (RIA) kit (Siemens,\nUSA); as well as TSH level using a chemiluminescence\nimmunometric assay (Immulite 2000\nAnalyzer, CPC, USA). Also fasting blood sample\nwas used to measure FBS level using Hitachi\n7600 analyzer, Hitachi, Japan, while the levels of\ncholesterol (Chol), Tg, aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HDL, and\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured using\nenzymatic calorimetric method (Hitachi 7600).\nIn addition a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test\nwas measured.  Demographic variables including age, education,\noccupation, and inhabitant area; reproductive\ncharacteristics including parity, history of infertility,\ntype of menstrual irregularity such as oligomenorrhea,\namenorrhea, and menometrorrhagia; and\nfamily history of diabetes mellitus were collected.   Statistical analysis  All data were analyzed using the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS, SPSS\nInc., USA) software version 16. Continues data\nwere shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the\nnormality of continuous variable. Normal distribution\nof quantitative variables was analyzed by\ntwo-tailed independent t test and non-normally\ndistributed variables by Mann-Whitney U test.\nCategorical data were shown as number (percentage).\nFisher\u2019s exact tests and chi-square test were\nused to compare the groups. Statistical significance\nwas considered as P<0.05.     Results  Prevalence of MetS in women with PCOS was\n28.8%. In PCOS women of both groups (15-35\nyears of age), the mean age was 25.63 \u00b1 5.17. In\nthis study, 72 patients were single and 123 were\nmarried, but in the analysis of reproductive characteristic,\ninvestigators did not assess single patients.  Most of women (83.8%) lived in urban area.\nMajority (79.7%) of women were housewife and\nsome (38.4%) of women had a university degree.\nMean infertility duration was 36.50 \u00b1 41.26. About\n54.9, 10.6, and 39.3% of married patients showed\na history for infertility, abortion, and diabetes in\ntheir families, respectively. Twenty two percent\nof married women were multiparous. Oligomenorrhea\nwas reported in 85.1% of women. Except\nfamily history of diabetes (P=0.043), there were\nno significant differences regarding demographic\nand fertility characteristics between PCOS women\nwith MetS and without MetS ( Table 1 ).  The findings of both groups showed that the WC\nexceeded 88 cm in 72.6%, hypertension (SBP/\nDBP \u2265130/85 mm Hg) in 9.3%, FBS level was 110\nmg/dl or greater in 6%, Tg level was 150 mg/dl or\ngreater in 47%, and HDL level was less than 50\nmg/dl in 86%. Individual components of the MetS\nin two groups of PCOS women (with MetS and\nwithout MetS) are shown in table 2 .

Some laboratory findings including Tg, Chol,\nFBS, 2-hBS, AST, and ALT were significantly\ngreater in PCOS women with MetS than women\nwithout MetS. Also HDL and LH in women with\nMetS were significantly lower than women without\nMetS. In other laboratory findings, such as serum\nlevels of LDL, PRL, DHEAS, T, FSH, FSH/\nLH, 17OHP, and TSH, differences between two\ngroups were not significant ( Table 4 ).  Prevalence of MetS in PCO+HA phenotype was\nhighest, but this difference was not statistically\nsignificant among four PCOS subtypes ( Table 5 ).

Discussion  PCOS is one of the most important endocrine\ndiseases in women. Many PCOS patients with several\nmetabolic abnormalities are at increased risk\nof MetS. The prevalence of MetS differs in various\npopulations which is mainly due to definition\nof PCOS or MetS, sampling methods, selecting\ncontrols, as well as age, race and weight of participants.\nInsulin resistance (IR) plays a crucial role in\nthe pathophysiology of MetS. On the other hand,\nIR is well recognized to play a major role in the\netiology of PCOS ( 21 - 23 ).  As expressed in previous reports, the prevalence\nof MetS in patients with PCOS is higher than general\npopulation ( 16 , 18 , 24 ), but its prevalence is\nnot the same in different ethnic groups. Increased\nwaist circumferences, elevated Tg level and reduced\nHDL level, known as important components\nof MetS, are associated with genetic factors\nand lifestyle characteristics ( 16 , 24 ). The finding\nof an increased risk of MetS in PCOS women has\nraised further interest in identifying the predictors\nfor MetS in these women ( 25 ). This study examined\nthe prevalence and related factors of MetS in\nPCOS patients living in north of Iran.  In this study, the prevalence of MetS in PCOS\nwomen was 28.8%. This finding is higher than other\nstudies in Iran ( 4 , 18 , 24 ), but lower than studies\nin United States ( 26 , 27 ). Mehrabian et al. ( 4 )\nshowed that the prevalence of MetS were 24.9%\namong Iranian women diagnosed with different\nphenotypic subgroups of PCOS, based on the Rotterdam\ncriteria. Moini et al. ( 24 ) who conducted\na study in Tehran, Iran, reported that prevalence\nof MetS in PCOS women was 22.7%. In another\nlarge-scale population-based study in Tehran, the\nprevalence of MetS in PCOS subjects was 18.5%\n( 18 ). This different prevalence may be related to\npopulation characteristics, diagnostic criteria and\nsample size.  This study showed that values of WC, SBP, DBP,\nBMI, obesity, and ovarian size were significantly\ngreater in patients with MetS than patients without\nMetS. In a report by Mandrelle et al. ( 17 ), age and\ncentral obesity (waist-hip ratio/waist circumference)\nwere considered as better predictors of MetS\nin PCOS women as compared to other parameters\nincluding BMI in this group of women.  This study showed that the values of biochemical\nparameters such as Tg, Chol, FBS, 2h BS, AST,\nand ALT were significantly greater in patients with\nMetS than without MetS. Also HDL and LH levels\nin women with MetS were significantly lower than\nwomen without MetS. Soares et al. ( 16 ) reported\nthat the occurrence of low HDL was the most frequent\nindividual component of MetS among Brazilian\nwomen with PCOS, followed by increased\nserum Tg.  For study limitation, our findings may be influenced\nby the criteria, by which PCOS and MetS\nwere diagnosed. We used different equipment and\ndifferent assessors during our study period that may\naffect our assessment reliability. Also this study was\na cross sectional study with small sample size. So it\nis suggested to do more cohort or case control studies\nwith greater sample size in future.    Conclusion  Based on our findings, prevalence of MetS in\nPCOS women was 28.8% that was higher than\nrelated values of other studies conducted on both\nPCOS women and general population in Iran.\nAmong individual components of MetS, WC>88\ncm, HDL>50, and Tg \u2265150 were prevalent in more\nthan 88% of PCOS women. PCOS women are high risk population for MetS. The special strategies is\nrequired for prevention of MetS and its related\ncomplications in PCOS women.",
