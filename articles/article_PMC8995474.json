    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine-metabolic disorder characterized by hyperandrogenemia, ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovaries, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance ( 1 , 2 ), abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism ( 3 ). Depending on different diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of PCOS ranges from 8 to 13% ( 4 ). Epidemiological surveys suggest that PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women ( 5 ). However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of PCOS are unclear, and there are no general strategies or drugs available for the treatment of patients with PCOS ( 6 ). Recently, PCOS rats induced with letrozole and high-fat diet (HFD) showed a highly similar phenotype to that of human PCOS, providing an extremely suitable model for the study of PCOS ( 7 ). Follicular dysplasia is an important clinical characteristic of patients with PCOS ( 8 ). During follicular development, granulosa cells (GCs) play indispensable roles in oocyte differentiation and energy production, which causally affects steroidogenesis, ovulation, folliculogenesis, atresia and luteinization ( 9 ). Oocyte presents a low glycolytic rate and mainly relies on the cumulus cells to convert glucose into substrates such as pyruvate and lactate, which can be readily utilized ( 10 ). The glycolytic pathway in GCs accounts for a large proportion of glucose metabolism and provides sufficient ATP and metabolites for the oocyte. Consequently, GCs are considered to be essential components of follicular development and their energy metabolism has attracted more and more attention ( 9 , 11 ).  Currently, increasing attention has been paid to screen effective and applicable drug candidates from traditional Chinese medicine ( 12 ). Mogroside V (MV), extracted from Siraitia grosvenorii (Luo-Han-Guo, LHG), is a triterpenoid glycoside that possesses broad pharmacological properties including antioxidant, hypoglycemic action, relieving cough, reducing sputum and etc. ( 13 ). MV presents a remarkable ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 14 ). MV can also reverse the abnormal cytoskeleton, mitochondrial dysfunction and early apoptosis of oocytes to protect against the deterioration of oocyte quality via up-regulating the expression of sirtuin 1 ( 15 ). In addition, MV can promote the development of porcine oocytes ( 16 ). Yan et\u00a0al., demonstrated that MV protected porcine oocytes from lipopolysaccharide-induced meiotic defects ( 17 ). Recent studies also found that MV could alleviates oocyte meiotic defects and quality deterioration in benzo(a)pyrene-exposed mice ( 18 ).  To our best knowledge, the effects of MV on energy metabolism during follicular development and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, the study aims to evaluate the protective roles and possible underlying mechanisms of MV on ovarian dysfunction of a young-adult PCOS rat model induced by letrozole and HFD. The present study may provide a potential strategy for PCOS therapy.    Materials and Methods   Chemical and Reagents  Letrozole was purchased from Heng Rui Pharmaceutical Company (190605KG, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China). Mogroside V (50.42% mogroside V), prepared from fresh fruit of Siraitia grosvenorii , was a generous gift from Professor Xingwei Liang, who purchased from Guilin Layn Natural Ingredients Corp. (MOV04-18022504, Guilin, Guangxi, China). Carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) was purchased from Henan Wan Bang Industrial Co., Ltd. (Henan, China).

Wright\u2019s\u2013Giemsa Stain solution (G1020) and 20 \u00d7 Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit (DA1015) were purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). BCA Protein Assay Kit (CW0014S), eECL Western Blot Kit (CW0049M) and SDS-PAGE Gel Kit (CW0022S) were purchased from Beijing ComWin Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Trizol reagent (15596026 and 15596018) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA). Key resources of the study were also summarized in  Supplemental Tables S1, S2  . All primers were designed and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).    Animals and Induction of PCOS  Female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 30, 5 weeks old, 173.66 \u00b1 7.73\u00a0g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the University of South China (Hengyang, China). All animals were kept in standard environmental conditions (25\u00b0C, 12\u00a0h light/dark cycle) with free access to standard food pellets and water. After adaptive feeding for one week, the animals were randomly divided into the control group (n = 10) and the PCOS group (n = 20). The rats from the control group were fed with standard food pellets; the rats from PCOS group were orally administrated with letrozole (1 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1% (w/w) CMC) ( 7 ) and fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, consisting of 61.5% standard food, 12% lard, 5% sucrose, 5% milk powder, 5% peanut, 10% egg, 1% sesame oil, 0.5% salt) from 1 st to 30 th days. From 21 st to 30 th day, the estrous cycle was identified by vaginal smear. According to the estrous cycle, the female rats successively stayed in metestrus and diestrus stages were preliminarily considered as PCOS models. Then, the young-adult PCOS rats were further divided into the PCOS group and the PCOS + MV group (n = 10 for each group). Rats in the PCOS + MV group were administrated through an oral gavage with mogroside V (MV, 600 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl) from 31 st to 60 th days, and vaginal cytology was performed from 51 st to 60 th days. At the end of the treatment period, all rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (0.8 ml/100\u00a0g) before sacrifice. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of University of South China (No. SYXK2020-0002).    Vaginal Cytology  Vaginal smears were performed for 10 consecutive days at 13:00 from the 21 st day of modelling and initiation of MV administration, respectively. Briefly, the vagina was flushed with 25-30 \u03bcl saline (0.9% NaCl) for 2~3 times. The vaginal fluid (10-20 \u03bcl) was sampled onto the glass slides and air dried at room temperature. Then, the slides were stained with Wright\u2019s\u2013Giemsa Stain solution (G1020, Solarbio, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Finally, the estrous cycle including proestrus, estrous, metestrus and diestrus phases and changes of vaginal epithelial cells were evaluated according to the predominant cell type ( 19 , 20 ) under a light microscope (BX43, OLYMPUS, PA, USA).    Serum Collection and Measurement of Hormone Levels  Following 12\u2009h of fasting, blood collected from the tail vein was used to measure fasting blood glucose (FBG) with a Roche blood glucose meter (Roche diagnostic GmbH, Germany). All rats were weighed and anesthetized with 20% urethane, and the whole blood sample was collected by abdominal aortic puncture immediately. The serum was further isolated by centrifuging (2000\u00a0g) for 10\u00a0min at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, the levels of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone and insulin were determined with radioimmunoassay (Beijing North Institute of Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). In brief, the serum samples (FSH: 200 \u03bcL, LH: 200 \u03bcL, testosterone: 50 \u03bcl, Insulin: 100 \u03bcL) were incubated with corresponding labeled antibodies (FSH and LH: 4 \u00b0C for 20\u00a0h, testosterone: 37 \u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, insulin: 37 \u00b0C for 2\u00a0h). Then, an immune separation agent was added to remove the uncombined antigens by mixing and centrifuging at 3800 rpm for 15 mins. After that, the radioactivity of the compound was detected to measure the corresponding hormone levels. Formula (FBG \u00d7 insulin level)/22.5 was used to detect homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ( 21 ).    Morphological Analysis of Ovarian Tissues  The left ovaries of rats from each group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin after serial dehydration, then were sequentially sectioned with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The morphological changes of the ovarian tissues were checked and photographed using a light microscope (BX 43; Olympus, PA, USA). In addition, the number of corpora lutea was counted in one representative section taken from the middle of the ovary under 10 \u00d7 or 20 \u00d7 magnification according to previous studies ( 22 , 23 ).    Targeted Energy Metabolomics With Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  The right ovaries of rats from each group were sent to Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) to analyze the targeted energy metabolomics via LC-MS/MS. In brief, 100 mg ovarian tissues, 200 \u03bcl of ultra-pure water and 800 \u03bcl of methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) were first added into the Eppendorf tubes. Then, the samples were grounded by ultrasonic homogenizers, incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 60\u00a0min, and centrifuged at 13, 000 rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were harvested and dried with nitrogen, and the lyophilized powder was stored at -80 \u00b0C. The lyophilized samples were reconstituted by dissolving with 100 \u03bcl solvent mixture containing water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). The samples were vortexed for 1\u00a0min and centrifuged at 14, 000 rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, the supernatants were collected for LC-MS/MS analysis. A hierarchical clustering heatmap was produced to visualize the metabolites expression level using the OmicStudio tools. ( https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool/4 ).    Transcriptome Assay  RNA-seq library construction and RNA sequencing of ovaries (n = 4 rats per group) were performed by the Novogene Corporation (Beijing, China). Total RNA (3 \u03bcg) was used as the initial RNA for database construction. The NEBNext \u00ae Ultra TM RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) was employed to build the library. The Illumina platform was employed to sequence these libraries using a 150 bp paired-end strategy. Reads with adapter, reads with N (N means the base information cannot be determined) and low-quality reads (reads with Qphred \u2264 20 bases accounting for more than 50% of the read length) were mainly removed and filtered from the original data. The construction of the index of the reference genome and the comparison of clean reads at the mating end with the reference genome were both performed with HISA T2 v2.0.5.    Abundance Estimation and Differential Expression Analysis for Genes  Feature Counts were used to calculate the readings mapped to each gene ( 24 ). The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) was then calculated based on the length of the gene and the readings mapped to that gene were calculated. Differential expression analysis of two conditions/groups (three biological replicates per condition) was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.16.1). The resulting P -values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg\u2019s approach to control the false discovery rate ( 25 ). Genes with an adjusted P -value ( P adj) < 0.05 were assigned as differentially expressed genes (DEGs).    Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Enrichment Analysis of DEGs  GO enrichment analysis of DEGs was implemented by the cluster-Profiler R package. GO terms with a corrected P -value less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly enriched by DEGs. ClusterProfiler R package was used to test the statistical enrichment of DEGs in KEGG pathways ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ).    Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) Analysis  Total mRNA was extracted from ovarian tissues with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedure. RNA (2 \u03bcg) was reversely transcribed into cDNA by using TransScript \u00ae One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit. RT-qPCR was performed in 10 \u03bcl volume using 2 \u00d7 Universal SYBR Green Fast qPCR Mix kit and Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gapdh was used as the reference and gene expression levels were calculated using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method. The mRNA expression levels were calculated as relative expression to Gapdh . All the primers were summarized in  Table\u00a01  , and the Ct values were summarized in  Supplemental Table S3  .   Table\u00a01   Primer sequences used for the qRT-PCR analysis.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens with primary antibodies including polyclonal LDHA antibodies (1:300 dilution), HK2 antibodies (1:400 dilution) and PKM2 antibodies (1:500 dilution), respectively. The immunoreactive signals of proteins were visualized with 20 \u00d7 Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit. Finally, sections were observed and photographed with an Olympus DP70 digital camera mounted on a Leica DMR microscope.    Western Blotting  Western blotting (WB) assay was performed as described previously ( 26 ). Briefly, the protein concentration was detected by a BCA Protein Assay Kit. Briefly, 40 \u03bcg protein samples were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Meck Millipore, Merck & Co., Inc., NJ, USA). Then, transferred membranes were blocked by 5% skim milk for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The primary rabbit monoclonal antibodies including LDHA (1:1000 dilution), HK2 (1:1000 dilution), PKM2 (1:1000 dilution), and \u03b2-tubulin (1:3000 dilution) were respectively incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, and the incubation of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) was performed for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. \u03b2-tubulin was detected as a loading control. Finally, eECL was added, and the Tanon-5500 Chemiluminescence Imaging System was used to detect the chemiluminescence of protein bands. Finally, blotting images were quantified using Image J analysis software (JAVA image processing program, NIH, Bethesda, USA).    Statistical Analysis  Bioinformatics analysis was performed with the OmicStudio tools ( https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool ). For all the data results, intra-assay coefficient of variation was < 10%, and inter-assay coefficient of variation was < 15%. All data were shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Differences between multiple groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison test. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Prism, USA). A p -value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   Effects of MV on Body Weight and the Estrous Cycle of Young-Adult PCOS Rats  To identify the effects of MV, young-adult PCOS rat model was established, and the experimental design was shown in  Figure\u00a01A  . There was a remarkable increase in body weight of the rats after the treatment of HFD and letrozole (  Figure\u00a01B  and  Table\u00a02  ), and this increase was significantly reduced after MV administration (  Figure\u00a01C  and  Table\u00a02  ). Estrous disorder is one of the main characteristics of PCOS rats ( 27 , 28 ), so the effects of MV on the estrous cycle of young-adult PCOS rats were conducted. In the control group, the rats had a regular estrous cycle (4-5 days) including proestrus, estrous, metestrus and diestrus phases sequentially (  Figures\u00a01D, E  ), which is consistent with previous studies ( 19 , 20 , 29 ). In the proestrus phase, there were mainly small and round nucleated epithelial cells with greyish red nucleus and greyish cytoplasm (black arrows point), which were relatively uniform in appearance and size. Estrous phase was predominantly characterized with flat and anucleated keratinized epithelial cells showing as blue or purple-blue stacks or layers (red arrows point). However, in the metestrus phase, neutrophils and nuclear epithelial cells were the predominant compositions, and anucleated keratinized epithelial cells were occasionally observed. In the diestrus phase, there were almost full of neutrophils (  Figure\u00a01D  , blue arrows point). Compared with the controls group, young-adult PCOS rats showed disrupted estrous cycles with prolonged diestrus but shortened proestrus and estrous phases (  Figure\u00a01F  ). Intriguingly, the irregular estrous cycle was gradually returned to be normal after MV administration (  Figures\u00a01D\u2013F  ).

Effects of MV on Hormone Levels, Ovary Weight and Ovary Morphology  To reveal the underpinning mechanism of protective effects of MV administration on dysfunctional estrous cycle, we further evaluated the effects of MV treatment on the hormone levels, ovary weight and ovary morphology of young-adult PCOS rats. There were no significant differences in FBG among control, PCOS and PCOS-MV groups (  Figure\u00a02A  and  Table\u00a02  ). Compared with the control group, though obvious increase was found in the serum level of insulin, HOMA-IR and testosterone of PCOS group, MV treatment only overtly reduced the level of testosterone in the PCOS-MV group, even there was downtrend without statistical significance found in insulin level and HOMA-IR (  Figures\u00a02B-D  and  Table\u00a02  ). In addition, there were no statistical differences in the serum levels of LH, FSH and LH/FSH between control vs PCOS and PCOS vs PCOS-MV groups (  Figures\u00a02E\u2013G  ). The ovary weight of PCOS group significantly increased, while that of PCOS-MV group apparently decreased (  Figure\u00a02H  ). Moreover, to check the improvement of MV on the folliculogenesis and ovulation of young-adult PCOS rats, we analyzed histological morphology of ovary and counted the number of corpora lutea. Compared with the control group, multiple follicles with cystic expansion presented vacuolated and disorganized structure and only a few corpora lutea were found in the PCOS group. However, follicles at different stages and obviously increased numbers of corpus luteum were observed in the control and PCOS-MV groups (  Figures\u00a02I\u2013K  ). Interestingly, the MV administration recovered the thickness of granulosa cell layers (  Figures\u00a02I\u2013K  ).

Effects of MV on Energy Metabolism of the Ovary  Given the key roles of glycolysis in the development and mature of follicles ( 10 ), we mainly focused on the main metabolites of glycolysis including D-Glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, ATP and GTP (  Figure\u00a03A  , red fonts). Compared with the control group, the production of D-Glucose 6-phosphate, lactate, ATP and GTP in the PCOS group was significantly down-regulated excepting an obvious up-regulation in the production of pyruvate (  Figures\u00a03A\u2013F  ). MV administration markedly increased the levels of D-Glucose 6-phosphate, lactate, ATP and GTP, and inversely decreased the pyruvate level (  Figures\u00a03A\u2013F  ).

Effects of MV on the Transcriptome of Ovary  To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the recovery of MV administration on the development and energy metabolism of ovaries, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of ovarian tissues. There were respective 828 upregulated and 1359 downregulated genes in the PCOS group when compared with the control group ( 26 ). Compared to the PCOS group, 969 and 819 genes were respectively upregulated and downregulated in rats from the PCOS-MV group (  Figure\u00a04A  ), among which 583 of the 828 genes upregulated genes and 676 of 1359 downregulated in the PCOS group were significantly reversed after MV administration (  Figure\u00a04B  ). These reversed genes are considered as MV-responsive genes (  Figure\u00a04B  ). In addition, the DEGs were involved in metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (  Figure\u00a04C  ). Notably, MV administration restored these metabolism-related biological processes, which were dysregulated in young-adult PCOS rats (  Figure\u00a04D  ). The expression levels of several genes related to glycolysis such as LDHA, HK2 and PKM exhibited a reversed phase between the PCOS and PCOS-MV groups (  Figure\u00a04D  ). These results led to the speculation that MV may improve the glycolysis in the ovaries of young-adult PCOS rats.   Figure\u00a04   Transcriptome analysis of ovarian tissues.

MV Reversed the Decrease of LDHA, HK2 and PKM2 in Young-Adult PCOS Rats  ATP production originally relies on the levels of glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes, which play indispensable roles in controlling glycolysis rate ( 30 ). LDHA, HK2 and PKM2 are key rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis ( 31 \u2013 33 ), which regulates the energy supply of oocytes and GCs ( 34 ). Given the above-mentioned transcriptome profiling that shows the reversed expression profile of LDHA, HK2 and PKM between the PCOS and PCOS-MV groups (  Figure\u00a04D  ), we further detected the expression levels of the three glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression levels of Ldha , Pkm2 and Hk2 were significantly down-regulated, MV administration obviously increased the mRNA expression of Ldha , Pkm2 and Hk2 (  Figures\u00a05A\u2013C  ). WB analysis presented the expression of LDHA, HK2 and PKM2 were significantly down-regulated in the ovarian tissues of young-adult PCOS rats, which was significantly up-regulated after MV administration (  Figures\u00a05D\u2013G  ). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis further showed that LDHA, HK2 and PKM2 markedly decreased in the PCOS group as compared with the control group and recovered in the PCOS-MV group (  Figure\u00a05H  ).

Discussion  In this study, we established a young-adult PCOS rat model exhibiting characteristics of obesity, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries through the oral administration of letrozole and HFD and examined the roles of MV on the development of follicles and ovulation by intragastric administration of MV. MV is reported to promote in vitro maturation of oocytes ( 16 ). This study for the first time proved the therapeutic effects of MV on follicle development and ovulation in young-adult rats (about 10 weeks old) with PCOS in vivo by upregulating the expression of LDHA, HK2 and PKM2 to improve the energy supply of follicle development.  According to previous results, PCOS severely impaired female reproduction due to anovulation. In the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)- or letrozole-induced PCOS rats/mice, they all exhibited increased body weight and ovary weight, disrupted estrous cycle, reduction of corpus luteum, decreased thickness of granular layers and increased apoptosis of GCs ( 35 \u2013 38 ). In this study, letrozole- and HFD-induced young-adult PCOS rats showed almost identical reproductive dysfunctions. Inversely, MV administration restored the abnormal estrous cycle, decreased the body weight and ovary weight, recovered the number of corpus luteum and the thickness of granular layers. These results indicated that MV could effectively improve follicular development and ovulation in young-adult PCOS rats (  Figure\u00a06  ).

Owning to the low glycolytic activity of oocytes that preferentially make use of metabolic substrates from GCs for energy homeostasis ( 10 ), the energy production of folliculogenesis predominantly relied on glycolysis of GCs ( 39 ). Therefore, dysfunction of energy metabolism in GCs could causally lead to aberrantly follicular development. Pyruvate and lactate, products of glycolysis in GCs, are two main energy substrates that play vital roles during folliculogenesis ( 40 ). Normally, the level of lactate in follicular fluid would increase with the maturity and size of the developing follicle ( 41 ). Studies have shown that there were disorders of glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism in follicular fluids of PCOS patients ( 42 ). Herein, the production of D-Glucose 6-phosphate, lactate, ATP and GTP in young-adult PCOS rats decreased significantly, while the production of pyruvate increased markedly (  Figure\u00a03  ). These metabolic characteristics were highly similar to previous studies showing that Diane-35 combined with metformin treatment improved the ovulation in the PCOS rat model possibly via regulating glycolysis pathway ( 43 ). On the other hand, MV administration markedly increased the levels of D-Glucose 6-phosphate, lactate, ATP and GTP, and decreased the level of pyruvate. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed the dysregulated metabolism-related processes including glycolysis, but MV administration restored the abnormal glycolysis. Moreover, the expression profiles of three glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes (LDHA, HK2 and PKM2) between PCOS and PCOS-MV groups further confirmed that MV could improve the disrupted glycolysis in the ovarian tissues of young-adult PCOS rats. Consistently, previous studies also showed that resveratrol upregulated LDHA, HK2, and PKM2 in the PCOS rats ( 26 ). Overall, these results indicated that MV improved ovulation potentially through promoting the glycolysis pathway, HK2 and PKM2 promoted pyruvate production, and LDHA promoted glycolysis process by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate (  Figure\u00a06  ).  Although numerous factors are responsible for the occurrence of PCOS, androgen is thought to be the pivotal one ( 44 \u2013 46 ). Hyper-androgen could induce ovarian GC pyroptotic death and follicular dysfunction in PCOS mice ( 47 ), preventing oocytes from maturation and ovulation. The levels of testosterone were all significantly increased in PCOS models induced by different drugs ( 35 \u2013 38 ). In this study, obvious up-regulation of testosterone and thinness of granular layers were also found in young-adult PCOS rats induced by letrozole and HFD, and MV administration apparently reduced the level of testosterone to normal and recovered the thickness of the granular layers, showing high effectiveness of MV on the restoring of PCOS symptoms. In addition to the increase of testosterone level, there were significantly elevated levels of the LH and LH/FSH ratio in PCOS models induced by letrozole ( 27 , 37 , 43 , 48 ). However, the levels of LH and FSH or LH/FSH ratio were found to be no statistical differences in PCOS mice or rats induced by DHEA ( 35 , 49 ). Our results were considered consistent with the latter, and this could probably be due to the limited number of samples. Moreover, as a common endocrine disorder, PCOS caused metabolic dysregulation that increased the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) ( 27 , 50 ). PCOS was often associated with insulin resistance and defects in insulin secretion ( 51 , 52 ). Apparent abnormality of FBG, insulin level and HOMA-IR were found in different PCOS models ( 27 , 35 , 43 ). Furthermore, Zhang et\u00a0al., demonstrated that MV have the potential to improve the conditions of hyperglycemia and regulate the secretion of insulin in T2DM rats ( 53 ). Here, although the levels of FBG, insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly increased in young-adult PCOS rats, there was only a downward trend without statistical significance after MV administration, while underlying mechanisms need to be further studied.  The present study has several limitations. Firstly, the rats used in this study were limited to young-adult rats, while the age has a significant impact on the ovary development, thus, future studies should confirm our findings in the rats with wide ranges of ages. Secondly, the acclimation of only one week for this type of study may be not sufficient, and future studies should consider longer period for acclimation. Thirdly, chemical reagents used for anesthetizing the rats may affect hormone balance, and we should cautious when interpreting these results. Fourthly, the stage of estrous cycle was assessed for only 10 days in our study, which may not be sufficient during such dynamic period of female reproductive life, thus, future studies may extend the duration for monitoring the stage of estrous cycle.    Conclusion  In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MV effectively improved follicular development and ovulation of young-adult PCOS rats induced by letrozole and HFD through accelerating glycolysis pathway to generate more energy, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for the therapy of female infertility caused by PCOS.
