In 1949, Speert first proposed an association between EC and PCOS,  4  and several subsequent studies confirmed this association.  5  ,  6  Haoula et\u00a0al. undertook a meta\u2010analysis of five comparative studies, concluding that women with PCOS were approximately three times more likely to develop EC than those without.  7  In a population\u2010based case\u2013control study, Fearnley et\u00a0al. found that the risk of EC was four times higher in women aged under 50\u2009years with PCOS than in the control group.  8  The increased risk of EC in PCOS is mainly related to estrogen, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual cycle disorders, insulin resistance, and obesity.  9  However, there is no specific molecule that can predict high\u2010risk patients with EC or improve the prognosis of patients with PCOS.  Alqutami et\u00a0al. identified enrichment of the PI3K\u2010Akt pathway in both PCOS and EC through transcriptome analysis.  10  Akt is a downstream target of PI3K, and its phosphorylation promotes follicular cell proliferation, abnormal follicular development, and anovulatory conditions, leading to PCOS. Decreased p\u2010Akt expression results in weakened insulin signal transmission, reduced Glut4 expression, and impaired glucose uptake and utilization, resulting in IR. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is overexpressed and activated in various cancers.  11  Mat\u00e0 et\u00a0al.  12  found that overexpression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is the basis of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in patients with PCOS\u2010IR, directly linking this pathway to PCOS, IR, and EC. Shafiee et\u00a0al.  13  observed increased expression of insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101 (IGF1), a member of the insulin signaling pathway, in the endometrium of patients with PCOS and EC.  Recently, carbon metabolism has been proposed in the pathogenesis of PCOS and EC.  14  ,  15  Carbon metabolism refers to the biochemical processes involving the utilization, transformation, and circulation of carbon compounds in organisms. These processes are essential for energy production, cell component synthesis, and maintenance of cell functions. One\u2010carbon metabolism is the central metabolic pathway involved in synthesizing various amino acids, methyl donors, and nucleotides. This intricate process hinges on the transfer of a carbon unit from the serine amino acid, facilitated by diverse forms of the cofactor folic acid. The ultimate destination of this carbon unit includes nucleotides and methyl groups, which are crucial for protein, RNA, and DNA methylation. The meticulous regulation of single\u2010carbon metabolism is pivotal for normal physiological functions and pathological conditions associated with this pathway. Notably, in diseases such as cancer, the exploitation of these regulatory mechanisms significantly increases the demand for nucleotides.  16    Glucose metabolism, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, is the main process of carbon metabolism. The glycometabolic pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS and EC. The reprogramming of intracellular energy metabolism is a focal point in cancer research. Aerobic glycometabolism (also known as the Warburg effect) is the primary form of energy metabolism in cancer cells. Glycometabolism is believed to be the main energy source for EC.  17  However, the relationship between PCOS, EC, and glycometabolism remains unclear.  This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between the pathogenesis of PCOS and EC, identify DEGs in PCOS, predict outcomes and prognosis in EC, and reveal the role of the common pathway, glucose metabolism, in the carbon cycle between PCOS and EC. These findings could provide a new strategy for preventing EC in patients with PCOS and improving the prognosis of patients with EC.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  The overall design of the study is presented in Figure 1 .   FIGURE 1   Flowchart of this study. CON, control; EC, endometrial cancer; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; NC, negative control; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.     In simple terms, the differential genes were obtained from the PCOS dataset GSE226146 and the EC dataset GSE196033 in GEO, and the intersection was taken. The intersection genes were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the results were found to be enriched in the carbon metabolism pathway. At the same time, the PPI network was constructed, and the core genes were obtained by Cytoscape. The core genes were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analysis again, and the results were also enriched in the carbon metabolism pathway. These core genes were verified by the GEO database, TCGA database, and online database GEPIA2, and their diagnostic value was evaluated by ROC curves and survival curves. The final gene was further verified by human EC tissues and mouse ovarian tissues, and the effect of this gene on EC cell proliferation and migration was evaluated by cell experiments and the effect on glucose metabolism in carbon metabolism.   2.1  Datasets  Gene expression data were obtained from the GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) (microarray type). Search terms included \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d and \u201cendometrial cancer,\u201d limited to Homo sapiens . Data preprocessing included filling and elimination. The study included data from PCOS dataset GSE226146 and EC dataset GSE196033 from endometrial tissue, with subsequent analyses and model training. The GSE54250 dataset from PCOS blood samples, the endometrial tissue\u2010derived EC database TCGA, and the public dataset GEPIA2 were used for reverse verification. Data were normalized using the \u201cnormalizeBetweenArrays\u201d function in the Limma package.    2.2  Genes coexpressed by two gene sets  The \u201cLmfit\u201d function in the Limma package was used to fit the linear model of each gene in a given sequence.  18  A \u201ccomparison fitting\u201d function was used to calculate the estimated coefficients and standard errors. Genes with a p value less than 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Upregulated or downregulated genes in both PCOS and EC were defined as common DEGs.  Volcano maps were generated using the ggplot package to show DEGs in PCOS and EC. A Venn diagram was generated using the package \u201cggVennDiagram\u201d to show the common DEGs between PCOS and EC.    2.3  Functional classification and pathway enrichment of DEGs  We further explored the function of the PCOS and EC coexpressed genes using GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses with the \u201cGO plot\u201d package in R software. The GO analysis included cellular components, BPs, and molecular functions.  19      2.4  Establishment of PPI and identification of hub genes  The PPI network was established using STRING  20  to explore interactions among the shared genes identified earlier. Interactions with scores exceeding 0.4 were considered significant. The PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape software. Subsequently, key protein expression molecules were identified using the Cytoscape plug\u2010in MCODE. Selection criteria included degree truncation\u2009=\u20092, node score truncation\u2009=\u20090.2, and maximum depth\u2009=\u2009100. Following this, the cytoHubba plug\u2010in was used for evaluation, applying seven algorithms (MCC, MNC, EPC, Degree, BottleNeck, Closeness, Radiality). Genes with at least two recurrences were designated as hub genes. For the identified core genes, GO and KEGG analyses were carried out, and string graphs were generated. GeneMANIA ( http://www.genemania.org/ ) was used to explore intragene associations and construct coexpression networks.  21      2.5  Analysis of validation datasets  The R package was used to draw other publicly available datasets, and GSE54250 and TCGA were used to further verify the expression levels of hub genes in the two diseases. GEPIA2 was used to verify differentially expressed core genes. The ROC curves and the area under the ROC curve of GSE54250 and TCGA datasets were drawn (using https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/ ) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of hub genes in predicting PCOS and EC. The survival curve of patients with EC was drawn using GEPIA2 to predict their prognosis. The two\u2010sample t \u2010test was used to compare the difference in expression levels, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical significance is expressed as follows: * p <\u20090.05, ** p <\u20090.01, and ns, no statistical significance ( p >\u20090.05).    2.6  Establishment and treatment of PCOS mouse model  The animal research protocol was approved by the Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. We followed the modeling method of Do et\u00a0al.  22  Four\u2010week\u2010old female C57BL/6\u2009J mice were purchased from Shanghai Slake Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. The mice had free access to food and water and were housed in a temperature\u2010controlled room (22\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C) with a 12:12 light\u2009:\u2009dark cycle. After 1\u2009week of domestication, the mice were randomly divided into two groups. The PCOS animal model was established by s.c. injection of soybean oil dissolved in dehydroepiandrosterone (6\u2009mg/100\u2009g bodyweight) for 20\u2009days ( n =\u20095). The control group ( n =\u20095) was injected daily with a soybean oil culture medium. The mice in the PCOS group showed an ovarian cycle/irregular cycle. At the end of the study, the mice were killed, and ovariectomies were carried out for further analysis.    2.7  Patient and tissue samples  From August 2022 to September 2023, five paraffin\u2010embedded EC specimens and five normal specimens were obtained at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. All wax blocks were approved by the patients, informed consent was obtained, and a guarantee made that personal information would not be disclosed to others or other institutions. Additionally, five EC specimens and five paracancerous tissues were collected for real\u2010time fluorescence quantitative PCR verification. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (number: 2023\u2013608).    2.8  Real\u2010time quantitative PCR  Total RNA was extracted from mouse ovarian and human endometrial tissues using TRIzol reagent (BioSharp). RNA purity and concentration were determined by spectrophotometry. Reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis were performed using the PrimeScript RT kit with a gDNA eraser (Perfect Real Time; Takara), following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, qRT\u2010PCR was undertaken three times using specific primers to detect mRNA expression levels in uterine tissue. \u03b2\u2010Actin served as the endogenous control of mRNA. Quantitative expression analysis was carried out using a StepOne Plus real\u2010time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Real\u2010time fluorescence quantitative PCR was undertaken using qPCR SYBR Green Mix (Takara). The relative mRNA expression was calculated using the 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394 C t method. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1 .

The sections were then blocked with goat serum for 1\u2009h and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the anti\u2010PGD primary Ab (1:300; Proteintech) or HK2 (1:200; Proteintech). Following this, sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary Abs at room temperature for 60\u2009min. Immunoreactivity was visualized by staining with 3,3\u2010diaminobenzidine (DAB) at room temperature. Hematoxylin was used for slight counterstaining, and the sections were dehydrated and covered with a glass slide. Immunoreactivity was quantified using Image\u2010Pro Plus 6.0 software, and the mean optical density was measured in three to five randomly selected fields of view for each slice.    2.10  Cell culture and transfection  Different EC strains (hec\u20101a, Ishikawa) and normal control hESC cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Logarithmic\u2010phase cells have been used in various functional studies. To reduce PGD expression, PGD siRNA was transfected using Reebok's transfection kit, and each test was completed after 24\u2009h.    2.11  Western blot analysis  The hESC and EC cell lines were lysed in RIPA buffer (Meron Bio) containing 1\u2009\u03bcL/100\u2009\u03bcL protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (Meron Bio) for 10\u2009min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000  g  at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Total protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Meillunbio). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS\u2010PAGE and imprinted onto a PVDF membrane (Meillunbio). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the following primary Abs: rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010PGD (1:2000; Chinese Proteintech), HK2 (1:1000; Chinese Proteintech), and rabbit anti\u2010GAPDH polyclonal Ab (1:10000; Affinity) as a control, for quantitative protein level expression.    2.12  Immunofluorescence  Cells were seeded in 15\u2009mm confocal culture dishes (NEST), fixed with formaldehyde for 20\u2009min, and then fixed with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 for infiltration. After incubation with 5% donkey serum (Sorabio) for 30\u2009min, the cells were incubated with specific primary Ab Ki\u201067 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 14\u2009h and then incubated with donkey anti\u2010rabbit 488 (1:500; Smyrph) for 60\u2009min in the dark. Finally, the film was sealed for 15\u2009min with an antifluorescence quencher containing DAPI and photographed using a confocal microscope (Nikon).    2.13  Transwell migration experiment  Endometrial carcinoma cells were transfected with PGD siRNA, and 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 cells were seeded into the upper chamber of a Transwell. The cells were cultured in a medium with a concentration of 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 4 /100\u2009\u03bcL; DMEM/F 12 (600\u2009\u03bcL) containing 10% FBS was injected into the inferior vena cava. After incubation for 24\u2009h, the penetrating cells were preserved in 4% methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The cells were visualized using an inverted microscope (Nikon).    2.14  Determination of glucose content  Following the manufacturer's instructions, glucose content in the cells within 0\u201324\u2009h after PGD siRNA transfection was measured using a glucose oxidase kit (Applygen Technologies Inc.).    2.15  Quantification of lactate levels  An LA Assay Kit (BC2230; Solarbio) was used to determine the LA content of lactic acid in cell lysates. The reagent solution was reacted with the reduction reaction color solution for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. The lactic acid extracted from different treatment groups was transferred to a 96\u2010well plate, and absorbance at 570\u2009nm was determined. Each experiment was repeated three times.    2.16  Statistical analysis  R software (version 4.1.3) was used for all statistical analyses. The Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test was used for comparisons, and a ROC curve was constructed using the microbiome ( https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/ ). Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.4.0. Student's t \u2010test was used to compare two groups and a one\u2010way ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups. Statistical significance was set at * p <\u20090.05, ** p <\u20090.01, ** p <\u20090.001, **** p <\u20090.0001.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Differentially expressed genes common in PCOS and EC  After pretreatment, 5020 DEGs were identified in the PCOS group and 152 DEGs in the EC group. The DEGs were visualized using volcano plots (Figure 2A,B ) and heatmaps (Figure 2C,D ). Further screening and Venn diagram analysis revealed 10 upregulated and 21 downregulated genes common to both diseases (Figure 2E,F ).   FIGURE 2   Differential gene expression analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometrial cancer (EC) database. (A, B) Differentially expressed genes of PCOS are represented by heatmap and volcano map. Red represents increased expression, blue represents decreased expression.

The GO analysis (Figure 2G ) indicated involvement in purine nucleoside triphosphate metabolic processes, respiratory chain complexes, and electron transfer activities. The main enrichment pathways of KEGG include the HIF\u20101 signaling pathway, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and central carbon metabolism of cancer (Figure 2H ). The results showed that metabolism plays an important role in PCOS and EC, potentially contributing to the increased risk of EC in patients with PCOS.    3.3  Protein\u2013protein interaction network construction and identification of core genes in coexpressed genes  We constructed a PPI network using the online search tool for interacting genes (STRING) to determine genome interactions (Figure 3A ). Using Cytoscape for visual analysis based on the MCODE plug\u2010in, the most closely connected regions (24 nodes and 61 edges) in the PPI network were identified (Figure 3B ). According to the level of expression of these molecules, red represents increased expression, and green represents decreased expression, as shown in Figure 3C . Next, the top 15 hub genes including GAPDH , LDHA , PGK1 , HIF1A , HK2 , PGD , and TFRC were identified using the CytoHubbaqu plug\u2010in (Figure 3D ). The GO and KEGG functional analyses of these core genes revealed associations with ATP metabolism, purine nucleoside triphosphate metabolism, and pathways such as the HIF\u20101 signaling pathway, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and carbon metabolism. These results are displayed in GO and KEGG chord diagrams (Figure 3E\u2013G ). From these results, we infer that the pathogenesis of PCOS and EC is related to nucleic acid metabolism.   FIGURE 3   Protein\u2013protein interaction network analysis. (A) The protein interaction network between coexpressed molecules was constructed using the String database.

(E\u2013G) Selected core genes functionally enriched by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).       3.4  Evaluation and validation of core genes  To assess the role of the 15 hub genes in diagnosing PCOS and EC, we used the PCOS dataset GSE54250 and the EC dataset in TCGA. Subsequently, we verified the 15 hub genes and obtained six statistically significant results (Figure 4A,B ). These six differential genes were further validated using the GEPIA2 database, revealing five differential genes in EC with statistical significance (Figure 4C ). To further study the diagnostic role of these five genes, we constructed ROC curves using the microbiome, showing that the area under the ROC curves of these five differential genes exceeded 0.5 (Figure 5A,B ). Survival curves for these five genes in EC were drawn using GEPIA2, and the effects of these five core genes on EC prognosis were further explored. The results demonstrated differences in the survival curves of HK2 , PGD , and Smad3 (Figure 5C ). As the expression of PHGDH and NDUFS8 differed between PCOS and EC, they were excluded. Consequently, it can be inferred that increased HK2 and PGD expression and decreased Smad3 expression are pivotal in the diagnosis and prognosis of PCOS and EC.

First, because the endometrium of polycystic ovaries is difficult to obtain in clinical practice, we constructed a PCOS mouse model and used RT\u2010PCR to verify the expression of HK2 , PGD , and Smad3 in normal and PCOS ovarian tissues. The results showed that HK2 and PGD were statistically significant, while Smad3 expression was contrary to predictions (Figure 6A ). We used human EC endometrial tissue for RT\u2010PCR verification of HK2 , PGD , and Smad3 expression, revealing increased expression of HK2 and PGD and decreased expression of Smad3 , consistent with predictions (Figure 6B ). The results from both verifications intersected, confirming HK2 and PGD . Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of ovarian and endometrial tissues at the protein level demonstrated increased expression of HK2 and PGD (Figure 6C ).   FIGURE 6   Differential genes were further verified by experiments. (A) Gene expression differences of PGD , Smad3 , and HK2 in tissues were verified by real\u2010time quantitative PCR. (B) Expression differences of PGD and HK2 proteins in tissues were verified by immunohistochemistry. (C\u2013F) Expression of PGD and HK2 protein in cells was verified by western blot analysis. * p <\u20090.05, ** p <\u20090.01, *** p <\u20090.001, **** p <\u20090.0001. CON, control; EC, endometrial cancer; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.     To further study the effects of HK2 and PGD on the pathogenesis and prognosis of EC, we constructed a cell model of EC, extracted human endometrial cells, and monitored the expression of the surface marker, vimentin, using immunofluorescence. The expression of HK2 and PGD in normal endometrial cells and two EC cell lines (Ishikawa and HEC1A) was compared by western blotting. HK2 expression decreased in tumor cells, contrary to predictions, whereas PGD expression increased in tumor cells, with Ishikawa cells being more obvious. Therefore, PGD and Ishikawa cells were selected for subsequent experiments (Figure 6D\u2013F ).    3.6  Inhibition of  PGD  expression can reduce the proliferation and migration of EC cells  To study the effect and prognosis of PGD on tumor cells, we transfected PGD siRNA and detected PGD expression in each group using western blotting. The results revealed higher PGD expression in the Ishikawa and PGD +\u2009NC groups compared with normal human endometrial cells significantly decreasing after transfection with PGD siRNA (Figure 7A,B ). We detected the expression of Ki\u201067 after transfection to determine changes in the proliferative ability of tumor cells after transfection with siRNA. The proliferative ability of Ishikawa and Ishikawa + NC groups was significantly enhanced and decreased, respectively, after transfection (Figure 7C,D ). Enhanced tumor migration is also an important cause of tumor recurrence and systemic metastasis. Therefore, we assessed the migration ability of PGD siRNA after transfection using a Transwell assay. The results showed decreased migration ability of Ishikawa cells after transfection, indicating that PGD could have an important effect on EC prognosis (Figure 7E ).   FIGURE 7   Low expression of PGD can inhibit the migration and proliferation of endometrial cancer (EC) cells.

CON, control; IntDen/Area, intensity density/area; NC, negative control.       3.7  Inhibition of  PGD  reduces glucose consumption and lactate production in EC   To explore the effect of PGD inhibition on glycometabolism in EC cells, we measured the lactic acid content in each group after PGD inhibition and glucose content in the cell supernatant at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24\u2009h after the intervention. The results showed decreased lactic acid content and glucose consumption after PGD inhibition (Figure 7F,G ).     4  DISCUSSION  The risk of EC increases in patients with PCOS.  23  Barry et\u00a0al. undertook a meta\u2010analysis and discovered an increased risk of EC in women of all ages with PCOS; however, the risk of ovarian and breast cancers did not increase significantly. Nonetheless, the existing evidence is not compelling. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS, differences in related risk factors (particularly obesity), and selection bias in the study might have contributed to an exaggerated risk increase.  24  From the results of our study, an increase in PGD is a key factor in the increased prevalence of EC in patients with PCOS, impacting the progression and recurrence of EC. The mortality rate associated with EC remains high, and studying the pathogenesis of high\u2010risk EC in patients with PCOS can effectively reduce the incidence of EC at its source. Additionally, effective intervention in patients with PCOS can prolong their survival and improve their prognosis.   PGD is involved in catalyzing the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways and is closely related to energy metabolism. PGD plays a crucial role in various cancers; however, its specific molecular mechanism in cancer remains unclear.  25  Research on PGD in PCOS is limited, with few studies discussing the direct relationship between the two. However, some studies have investigated the pathogenesis of oxidative stress,  26  metabolic abnormalities,  27  and PCOS; PGD may be involved in these processes as a key enzyme related to redox balance and metabolism.  Traditionally, PGD has been considered an antioxidant enzyme. Its main biochemical functions include participating in the synthesis and metabolism of 5\u2010phosphate ribose in nucleotide synthesis and regenerating NADPH and glutathione, thereby detoxifying ROS. However, in recent years, there has been strong interest in the pro\u2010oxidation of ROS generated by PGD through NADPH oxidase (NOX). Nitrogen oxides generate ROS in phagocytes and play a role in killing micro\u2010organisms (i.e., cytotoxic effects). Nitric oxide\u2010derived ROS act as signaling molecules in many nonphagocytic cells to promote cell activity, a process known as cellular regulatory effects. PGD\u2010derived NADPH has substantial effects on cellular oxidative and nitrosative stress/injury responses, as well as cell growth and proliferation.  28    At the molecular level, PGD is involved in cancer\u2010related BP through multiple pathways. Its regulation is related to the imbalance of lncRNAs. For example, downregulation of the tumor suppressor lncRNA growth inhibition\u2010specific transcript 5 (GAS5) induces G 1 /S cell cycle progression by upregulating cell cycle\u2010related proteins.  29  ,  30  Simultaneously, the lncRNA protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P) regulates the growth and chemotherapy resistance of multiple myeloma by interacting with the sequence\u2010specific DNA\u2010binding protein c\u2010Myc, which is related to cancer growth and chemotherapy resistance.  31  Additionally, PGD promotes the formation of PGD dimers by interacting with the mitotic regulator polo\u2010like kinase 1 (Plk1), coordinating pentose phosphate pathway flux and cell cycle progression, thereby contributing to cancer cell proliferation.  28  Therefore, increased PGD expression in patients with PCOS may be an important reason for the increased risk of EC.  Metabolic syndrome is closely associated with aggressive EC. Patients with EC and metabolic syndrome showed higher proportions of grade 2\u20133, stage II\u2013IV, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic space infiltration, or deep myometrial infiltration compared with those without metabolic syndrome.  32  A prospective cohort study reported that metabolic syndrome was associated with poorer overall survival in patients with EC (hazard ratio 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.07\u20133.67).  33  These studies have shown that metabolic syndrome plays a crucial role in the epidemiological development of EC. Glycometabolism plays an important role in carbon metabolism in ECs. Glycometabolism is upregulated in cancer cells than in normal cells.  34  In PCOS, impaired glycometabolism and increased mitochondrial activity are associated with estrogen receptor \u03b1\u2010dependent endometrial hyperplasia, which may be an early marker of EC.  35  Additionally, PGD , a hub gene in PCOS and EC, can reduce the proliferation and migration of EC cells by inhibiting PGD and glycometabolism. Therefore, PGD is a potential target for regulating glucose metabolism and treating EC.  In conclusion, this study identified a hub gene through bioinformatics analysis and experimental research, aiding in the understanding of the pathophysiological processes of PCOS and EC. It also provides a potential target for the early diagnosis and treatment of PCOS and EC. However, our study has some limitations. We only studied the potential role of PGD in PCOS and EC and the role of glycometabolism in PGD and EC cells without delving into their specific mechanisms. Due to limited laboratory equipment, we could not directly reflect the role of the carbon cycle in PGD, PCOS, or EC through the oxygen consumption rate, which requires further exploration. Additionally, our findings were based on predictions and validations from public databases. Therefore, further clinical data are needed to verify whether an increase in PGD increases the risk of EC in patients with PCOS and whether survival rates are related to PGD .  This study clarified that PCOS and EC have 10 coexpressed upregulated genes and 21 coexpressed downregulated genes. Furthermore, increased PGD expression is a significant factor in the increased risk of EC in patients with PCOS. We found that glycometabolism in carbon metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS and EC, and that a decrease in PGD expression can reduce the proliferation and migration abilities of EC cells, which is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with EC.
