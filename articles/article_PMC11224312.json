    "abstract": "Screening for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in antenatal care is inadequate, largely owing to the lack of clarity around whether PCOS is an independent risk factor for pregnancy complications. This systematic review and meta-analysis include 104 studies and 106,690 pregnancies in women with and without PCOS from inception until 13th July 2022. We report that women with PCOS are younger and have higher body mass index (BMI) around conception and have greater gestational weight gain. The odds of miscarriage, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and cesarean section are higher in women with PCOS. The increased odds of adverse outcomes in PCOS remain significant when age and BMI are matched and when analyses are restricted to high-quality studies. This work informed the recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome, emphasizing that PCOS status should be captured in all women who are planning to, or have recently become pregnant to facilitate prevention of adverse outcomes and improve pregnancy outcomes. This meta-analysis demonstrates that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and cesarean section, independent of age and BMI. Early screening for PCOS can improve pregnancy outcomes and long-term health in women.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a lifelong condition and, with a prevalence of 5% to 13%, is the most prevalent endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age 1 . In adults, diagnosis is based on a minimum of two criteria of hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries 2 . Obesity is common in PCOS 3 and exacerbates intrinsic insulin resistance and the clinical manifestations of PCOS 4 . Anxiety, depression and poor quality of life are also more common in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS 5 . Affected women are also more likely to have anovulatory infertility 6 , requiring treatments such as assisted reproductive technology (ART) to conceive. While each of the metabolic, psychological, and reproductive features of PCOS is recognized in antenatal care guidelines as an independent risk factor for pregnancy complications, women with PCOS are not universally considered a high-risk group for pregnancy complications 7 .  In previous meta-analyses, women with PCOS were shown to have elevated odds of pregnancy complications. These include significantly higher odds of miscarriage, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, cesarean section 8 \u2013 12 , gestational weight gain 8 , and induction of labor 8 , compared with women without PCOS. Instrumental delivery was similar in women with and without PCOS 9 , 10 , while perinatal depression was an untapped area of research in this population 8 . Importantly, the increased odds of pregnancy complications in PCOS were influenced by PCOS diagnostic criteria, age, obesity, conception mode 8 , and quality of studies 8 , 9 , 11 .  While empirical evidence demonstrates that women with PCOS have higher odds of pregnancy complications, substantial clinical heterogeneity was reported in pooled analyses. Furthermore, subgroups and univariate or multivariate meta\u2010regression analyses had small numbers of studies, which were insufficient to obtain meaningful results 8 . In the context of the 2023 update of the International Evidence\u2010Based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 2 , we aimed to update our prior systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta\u2010regression 8 to determine the prevalence of pregnancy complications in women with and without PCOS. With an expanded data set, we also aimed to explore whether pregnancy outcomes in women with and without PCOS are affected by age, body mass index (BMI), conception with ART, or high-quality study design.    Results  The literature search identified 4595 articles published since 2017, of which 39 studies were included in the meta-analysis after full-text review. Agreements between the reviewers in the title and abstract screening and full-text screening were considered good and excellent, with kappa values of 0.72 and 0.94, respectively 13 . There were 77 studies in the 2017 meta-analysis, of which 65 studies were included (after removing those not meeting the updated eligibility criteria for PCOS diagnosis). Combining the new and previous articles, a total of 104 articles were included in the present systematic review (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram of study selection. This figure illustrates the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram detailing the study selection process. The diagram includes the number of records identified, screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the meta-analysis.   The outcomes were reported in 17384 women with PCOS and 89,306 women without PCOS (Supplementary Table 1 ). Fifty-two studies were conducted in Asia, 26 in Europe, 21 in America, two in Australia and New Zealand and two in Africa. One study recruited women with multiple pregnancies 14 . Six studies reported outcomes in women who took metformin after conception 15 \u2013 20 , and one study reported outcomes in women who had conceived after bariatric surgery 21 . Thirty-three studies reported outcomes in post-ART pregnancies 22 \u2013 54 , and four reported outcomes in pregnancies with GDM in women with and without PCOS 55 \u2013 58 . Sixteen studies had a high-quality design 18 , 25 , 36 , 48 , 56 , 59 \u2013 69 . Twenty-seven studies matched women with and without PCOS for age 17 \u2013 19 , 22 , 32 , 36 , 48 , 56 , 59 \u2013 64 , 66 \u2013 78 and 14 for age and BMI 36 , 48 , 56 , 60 \u2013 64 , 66 , 68 , 70 , 75 , 77 , 78 . No publication bias was found for any of the outcomes. The certainty of evidence for the outcomes was very low to moderate, mainly due to a high risk of bias, serious inconsistency, and serious indirectness. Further details are delineated in the Technical Report for the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 79 .  Overall, 69 studies reported age, and 58 studies reported BMI either at preconception or at early pregnancy. Women with PCOS were younger (MD: \u22120.63 years; 95% CI: \u22120.87, \u22120.39) and had a higher BMI (1.76\u2009kg/m 2 ; 1.44, 2.08) compared with women without PCOS. Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 16 , 17 , 20 or conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , lower age (\u22120.68 years; \u22120.93, \u22120.44) and higher BMI (1.68\u2009kg/m 2 ; 1.35, 2.00) remained significant in PCOS.

Gestational weight gain  Sixteen studies reported mean gestational weight gain in 755 women with PCOS and 1765 women without PCOS 41 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 64 , 71 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 80 \u2013 86 . Women with PCOS had higher gestational weight gain compared with women without PCOS (MD: 0.96\u2009kg; 95% CI: 0.01, 1.90). There were no studies in which women were taking metformin after conception. Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the MD of gestational weight gain in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time; however, studies published before 1999 ( n =\u20092) contributed to heterogeneity. Higher gestational weight gain was not retained in post-ART pregnancies 41 , prospective 56 , 58 , 75 , 83 \u2013 85 and high-quality studies 56 , 59 , 64 . Two studies reported gestational weight gain in pregnancies with GDM 56 , 58 ; gestational weight gain was higher in women with PCOS (1.81\u2009kg; 0.42, 3.19). In seven studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 56 , 59 , 64 , 71 , 74 , 75 , 77 and in four for both age and BMI 56 , 64 , 75 , 77 ; PCOS was associated with gestational weight gain in neither age-matched nor age- and BMI-matched studies.    Miscarriage  Forty-five studies reported miscarriage 20 \u2013 31 , 34 \u2013 39 , 42 \u2013 52 , 54 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 77 , 78 , 87 \u2013 95 ; one study was excluded from the meta-analysis because of overlapping participants 62 , leaving 9893 women with PCOS and 57411 women without PCOS. Miscarriage was defined as pregnancy loss within the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy (using serial ultrasound) in one study 34 or within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in seven studies 36 , 38 , 40 , 54 , 88 , 91 , 93 , birth prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy in two studies 38 , 77 , spontaneous pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy in three studies 24 , 25 , 43 , prior to 24 weeks of pregnancy in two studies 42 , 48 or prior to 28 weeks of pregnancy in one study 53 and pregnancy loss encompassing miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy in one study 44 . The remaining 27 studies did not provide a definition. The odds of miscarriage were higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.85). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 20 or conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , miscarriage remained higher in women with PCOS (1.53; 1.23, 1.92). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the odds of miscarriage in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time. The higher odds of miscarriage were retained in post-ART pregnancies 22 \u2013 29 , 31 , 34 \u2013 40 , 42 \u2013 52 , 54 , prospective 22 \u2013 24 , 27 , 31 , 34 , 35 , 37 \u2013 39 , 43 , 45 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 78 , 89 , 94 and high-quality studies 25 , 36 , 48 , 63 , 65 , 66 . In seven studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 22 , 36 , 48 , 63 , 66 , 77 , 78 , and in six, for both age and BMI 36 , 48 , 63 , 66 , 77 , 78 ; PCOS was associated with increased odds of miscarriage in age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies.    Gestational diabetes  Fifty-eight studies reported GDM in 10011 women with PCOS and 57041 women without PCOS 14 \u2013 21 , 25 , 32 , 33 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 49 , 53 , 59 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 \u2013 78 , 80 \u2013 83 , 88 , 92 , 94 \u2013 113 . Three studies were excluded from the meta-analysis because of overlapping participants 15 , 62 , 109 . Inconsistent definitions were provided for GDM across the studies. The odds of GDM were higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (OR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.95, 2.99). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 16 \u2013 20 or conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , the odds of GDM remained higher in PCOS (2.46; 1.99, 3.04). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the odds of GDM in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time. The higher odds of GDM were retained in post-ART pregnancies 25 , 32 , 33 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 49 , 53 , 95 , prospective 63 , 65 , 66 , 70 , 73 , 75 , 76 , 78 , 83 , 88 , 94 , 100 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 110 and high-quality studies 25 , 59 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 . In 14 studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 32 , 59 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 70 \u2013 78 and in seven for both age and BMI 63 , 66 , 68 , 72 , 73 , 77 , 78 ; PCOS was associated with increased odds of GDM in age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies.    Gestational hypertension  Forty-one studies reported gestational hypertension in 5978 women with PCOS and 32230 women without PCOS 17 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 32 , 41 , 49 , 56 \u2013 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 , 71 , 74 , 76 , 78 , 82 , 83 , 88 , 92 , 94 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 102 , 103 , 105 , 107 , 109 , 111 \u2013 115 . Two studies were excluded from the meta-analysis because of overlapping participants 62 , 109 . Gestational hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg in five studies 65 , 69 , 74 , 88 , 104 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg after 20 weeks of pregnancy in nine studies 18 , 59 , 66 , 76 , 78 , 81 , 83 , 103 , 113 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg at two occasions more than a day apart in one study 107 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg at two occasions more than six hours apart after 20 weeks of pregnancy in one study 114 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg at two occasions more than six hours apart after 20 weeks of pregnancy and normalized by four to six weeks postpartum in one study 60 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg at two occasions after 20 weeks of pregnancy or systolic blood pressure \u2265 150\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 100\u2009mmHg during labor in two studies 32 , 71 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg without proteinuria after 20 weeks of pregnancy in two studies 18 , 41 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg with or without proteinuria after 20 weeks of pregnancy in two studies 92 , 95 , systolic blood pressure \u2265 140\u2009mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90\u2009mmHg with or without proteinuria 68 in the third trimester in two studies 97 , and diastolic blood pressure > 90\u2009mmHg at two occasions over pregnancy in one study 98 . The remaining 22 studies did not provide a definition. The odds of gestational hypertension were higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.81, 2.69). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 17 , 18 , 20 , gestational hypertension remained higher in PCOS (2.22; 1.83, 2.70). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the odds of gestational hypertension in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time; however, two studies published before 2001 contributed to heterogeneity. The higher odds of gestational hypertension were retained in post-ART pregnancies 32 , 41 , 49 , 95 , prospective 56 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 76 , 78 , 83 , 88 , 94 , 102 , 105 , 107 and high-quality studies 56 , 59 \u2013 61 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 . Three studies reported gestational hypertension in pregnancies with GDM 56 \u2013 58 ; the odds of gestational hypertension were higher in women with PCOS (2.57; 1.71, 3.88). In 12 studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 32 , 56 , 59 \u2013 61 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 71 , 74 , 76 , 78 and in seven for both age and BMI 56 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 78 ; PCOS was associated with increased odds of gestational hypertension in age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies.    Pre-eclampsia  Thirty-seven studies reported pre-eclampsia in 4999 women with PCOS and 24660 women without PCOS 14 \u2013 16 , 20 , 21 , 32 , 41 , 55 \u2013 58 , 60 \u2013 63 , 66 , 69 , 71 , 74 , 77 , 78 , 81 \u2013 83 , 88 , 94 , 97 , 98 , 102 , 103 , 105 , 107 \u2013 109 , 112 , 113 , 116 . Three studies were excluded from the meta-analysis because of overlapping participants 15 , 62 , 109 . Pre-eclampsia was defined as gestational hypertension along with proteinuria in three studies 66 , 78 , 116 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria >2+ by urine stick in two studies 16 , 98 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria >300\u2009mg in 24\u2009h in thirteen studies 14 , 32 , 55 , 58 , 60 , 69 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 83 , 88 , 103 , 104 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria >300\u2009mg in 24\u2009h or \u22651+ by urine stick in one study 102 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction in two studies 41 , 113 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria >300\u2009mg in 24\u2009h or a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio of \u226530\u2009mg/mmol or when the hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets syndrome was present in one study 107 , gestational hypertension along with proteinuria 100\u2009mg/dL or >2+ in at least two random urine specimens collected six or more hours apart or >300\u2009mg in 24\u2009h and/or pathologic edema in three studies 71 , 81 , 115 . The remaining 22 studies did not provide a definition. The odds of pre-eclampsia were higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.87, 2.82). Sensitivity analysis showed that, after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 16 , 20 or conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , pre-eclampsia remained higher in PCOS (2.36; 1.93, 2.90). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested a diminishing magnitude in the odds of pre-eclampsia in women with and without PCOS over time.  The higher odds of pre-eclampsia were retained in post-ART pregnancies 32 , 41 and prospective 56 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 78 , 83 , 88 , 94 , 102 , 105 , 107 , 116 and high-quality studies 56 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 69 . Four studies reported pre-eclampsia in pregnancies with GDM 55 \u2013 58 ; the odds of pre-eclampsia were higher in women with PCOS (2.72; 1.77, 4.19). In 10 studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 32 , 56 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 71 , 74 , 77 , 78 and in seven for both age and BMI 56 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 77 , 78 ; PCOS was associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia in age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies.    Eclampsia  Two studies reported eclampsia in 46 women with PCOS and 246 women without PCOS 32 , 60 . One study reported no pregnancies affected by eclampsia 60 ; therefore, only one study 32 in post-ART pregnancies was used in the meta-analysis for generating the OR. The odds of eclampsia were similar in women with and without PCOS (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.44, 3.08). Participants in this study were not taking metformin after conception.    Induction of labor  Eight studies reported the induction of labor in 1029 women with PCOS and 10052 women without PCOS 14 , 21 , 56 , 82 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 107 . The odds of induction of labor were similar in women with and without PCOS (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.97, 2.70). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of a study in which women conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , the induction of labor was higher in the PCOS group (1.69; 1.01, 2.85). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the odds of induction of labor in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time; however, one study published before 2012 contributed to heterogeneity. No studies reported the induction of labor in post-ART pregnancies. The odds of induction of labor were higher in prospective studies 56 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 107 but similar in a single high-quality, age- and BMI-matched study that reported outcomes in pregnancies with GDM 56 .    Instrumental delivery  Ten studies reported instrumental delivery in 1517 women with PCOS and 8570 women without PCOS 21 , 56 , 62 , 66 , 72 , 98 , 103 , 105 , 111 , 116 . The odds of instrumental delivery were similar in women with and without PCOS (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.53). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of a study in which women conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , instrumental delivery remained similar in women with and without PCOS (1.17; 0.90, 1.52). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that the odds of instrumental delivery in women with and without PCOS did not substantially change over time. The odds of instrumental delivery were similar in prospective 56 , 62 , 66 , 105 , 116 and high-quality studies 56 , 66 , 88 . No studies reported instrumental delivery in post-ART pregnancies. Only one study reported instrumental delivery in pregnancies with GDM 56 , whereby the odds were similar in women with and without PCOS (1.35; 0.22, 8.41). In four studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for both age and BMI 56 , 66 , 72 , 88 , in which PCOS was not associated with instrumental delivery.    Cesarean section  Thirty-seven studies reported cesarean section in 3590 women with PCOS and 23017 women without PCOS 14 , 17 , 21 , 25 , 33 , 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 53 , 56 \u2013 59 , 62 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 71 , 74 , 78 , 82 , 85 , 86 , 94 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 102 \u2013 107 , 111 , 116 , 117 . The odds of cesarean section were higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.43). Sensitivity analysis showed that after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception 17 or conceived after bariatric surgery 21 , cesarean section remained higher in PCOS (1.23; 1.06, 1.44). Convergence could not be achieved during tau 2 estimation in random-effects cumulative meta-analysis. The higher odds of cesarean section were retained in prospective 38 , 56 , 58 , 62 , 63 , 66 , 78 , 85 , 94 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 116 , 117 and high-quality studies 25 , 56 , 59 , 62 , 63 , 66 , 68 but were not retained for post-ART pregnancies 25 , 33 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 53 . Three studies reported cesarean section in pregnancies with GDM 56 \u2013 58 , the odds of which were higher in women with PCOS (1.69; 1.19, 2.39). In nine studies, women with and without PCOS were matched for age 56 , 59 , 62 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 71 , 74 , 78 and in six for both age and BMI 56 , 62 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 78 ; PCOS was associated with increased odds of cesarean section in age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies.    Perinatal depression  One study reported perinatal depression in 3590 women with PCOS and 23017 women without PCOS 118 , with similar odds between groups (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.88). Participants in this study were not taking metformin after conception.    Meta-regression  Significant heterogeneity ( I 2 >\u200950%) was observed for studies reporting miscarriage, GDM, gestational hypertension, gestational weight gain, induction of labor and cesarean section. There was an insufficient number of studies (<10) for the induction of labor to perform meta\u2010regression.  Where reported (Table 2 ), age was lower in women with PCOS for miscarriage and GDM. However, BMI was higher in women with PCOS for miscarriage, GDM, gestational hypertension, gestational weight gain and cesarean section. In univariate meta\u2010regression, variation in age was associated with increased odds of miscarriage, with a one-year increase in age being associated with 32% higher odds of miscarriage. Age reduced the tau 2 value for miscarriage from 0.31 to 0.22, indicating that 29% of between-study variance may be attributable to age. However, variation in BMI across studies was not associated with increased odds of any of the outcomes in the meta\u2010regression.

Discussion  In this comprehensive systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta\u2010regression of 104 published articles in 17384 women with and 89306 women without PCOS, women with PCOS were younger, had higher BMI around conception and had higher gestational weight gain. They were more likely to experience pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, GDM, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, induction of labor, and cesarean section. Induction of labor became higher in PCOS in the sensitivity analysis, excluding women who conceived after bariatric surgery and in prospective studies. In sensitivity meta-analyses, PCOS remained associated with higher miscarriage, GDM, hypertension and pre-eclampsia in post-ART pregnancies, prospective and high-quality studies and age-matched and age- and BMI-matched studies. Cesarean section remained associated with PCOS in prospective and high-quality studies and age-matched and age- and BMI-matched studies, but it was not associated with PCOS in post-ART pregnancies.  Overweight and obesity affect approximately 70% of women in the United States and are increasing worldwide 119 . There is also a global increase in gestational weight gain above recommendations 120 , which is a key independent contributor to obesity in the female population. Suboptimal weight around conception and insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain are associated with adverse maternal and offspring outcomes 121 . Aging is associated with a higher weight and worsened pregnancy outcomes 122 . We found that women with PCOS conceive at a higher BMI compared with women without PCOS and have higher gestational weight gain. These were assessed only and for the first time in our previous systematic review and meta-analysis 8 and have been reaffirmed in these updated analyses. Mean differences in gestational weight gain did not have substantial variation over time. Women with PCOS were also younger. We were underpowered for the majority of the sensitivity analyses by age-matched or age- and BMI-matched studies. Our findings suggest that the higher gestational weight gain in PCOS is likely related to factors other than PCOS status, such as age and BMI. However, the higher odds of miscarriage, GDM, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and cesarean section are probably independent of age and BMI. The 2023 International Evidence\u2010based PCOS Guideline 2 recommends early lifestyle intervention in women with PCOS to manage weight and improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes. However, the association of PCOS with increased odds of miscarriage, GDM, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and cesarean section is probably independent of age and/or BMI.  Miscarriage affects 15.3% of confirmed pregnancies worldwide 123 . Here, we found that women with PCOS have 49-53% higher odds of miscarriage, and these increased odds were independent of time and ART and were retained in both prospective and high-quality studies. Age was a risk factor for increasing the odds of miscarriage independent of PCOS in univariate meta\u2010regression. Our findings of increased odds of miscarriage in PCOS and the association with age are consistent with prior literature 8 and are not reported in other systematic reviews 9 \u2013 12 . Here, we report for the first time that higher odds of miscarriage were observed in a younger population of women with PCOS. While ovulation rates improve in women with PCOS as they age, successful pregnancy and live births decrease with age 124 . This highlights that the odds of miscarriage would probably be even higher in PCOS if age was similar between the two groups. The magnitude for higher odds of miscarriage in PCOS decreased in post-ART pregnancies, but inconsistent with our original meta-analysis 8 , it remained higher in PCOS, with significant heterogeneity. However, the recent findings reported herein are based on a larger number of included studies and more accurate PCOS diagnosis and thus are likely more reliable.  Gestational diabetes affects up to 30% of pregnancies, depending on diagnostic criteria and ethnicity 125 . It is associated with increased rates of cesarean section, preterm labor, macrosomia, and large-for-gestational age offspring 126 and with increased maternal risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases later in life 127 . We found that PCOS is associated with 2-3-fold higher odds of GDM, and the increased odds were independent of time and ART and were retained in both prospective and high-quality studies. Where information was provided, women with PCOS were younger and had a higher BMI than women without PCOS. In those with PCOS, neither age nor BMI was associated with increased odds of GDM in the adjusted analysis, highlighting that the higher odds of GDM in PCOS are likely due to factors other than increased BMI. The magnitude for higher odds of GDM in PCOS decreased in post-ART pregnancies, but inconsistent with our prior meta-analysis 8 , it remained higher in PCOS. The attenuated odds are probably due to BMI restrictions for ART and poorer treatment outcomes in individuals with higher BMI 128 . Compared to the previous review, however, the validity of findings in this review is increased by the larger number of included studies and more accurate PCOS diagnosis. The 2023 International Evidence\u2010based PCOS Guideline recommends that women with PCOS are offered an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for early diagnosis and intervention, ideally at preconception; if not performed at preconception, at the first antenatal visit and then repeated at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy.  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affect 8.5-16.7% of pregnancies, depending on ethnicity 129 . Gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia are leading causes of pregnancy-related maternal mortality and are associated with 2-3-fold increases in long-term mortality from maternal cardiovascular disease 130 . We found that PCOS is associated with 2-3-fold higher odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, independent of ART, and this was retained in both prospective and high-quality studies. Over time, the odds of pre-eclampsia diminished but remained higher in PCOS. This could be due to later studies including younger women with PCOS 131 who are less likely to have chronic hypertension 132 . Where information was provided, women with PCOS were of similar age as women without PCOS and had higher BMI, with neither being associated with increased odds of gestational hypertension on meta\u2010regression. This highlights that the higher odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in PCOS were due to factors other than increased BMI. We confirm the findings of our previous meta-analysis 8 , which showed that the higher odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are likely independent of, but worsened by, GDM; however, we were underpowered for this sensitivity analysis. The higher odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in PCOS were retained in post-ART pregnancies. This is inconsistent with the findings of our previous meta-analysis 8 , although the results are likely more reliable in the present review given the larger number of studies included here. Based on these findings, the 2023 International Evidence\u2010based PCOS Guideline 2 has recommended monitoring of blood pressure in women with PCOS, ideally commencing in the preconception period.  Although spontaneous vaginal delivery is the most common type of delivery, the rates of induction of labor, instrumental delivery and cesarean section are increasing 133 . Induced and/or operative deliveries are indicated in high-risk pregnancies for mothers or offspring. The underlying conditions and the interventions may both increase the risk of hemorrhage, infection, and rehospitalization 134 . We found that women with PCOS have higher odds of cesarean section, which were retained in both prospective and high-quality studies. However, the odds were similar in post-ART pregnancies in women with and without PCOS. For the induction of labor and instrumental delivery, the odds were similar in women with and without PCOS, which may have been masked by the increased odds of cesarean section in women with PCOS. Our findings are consistent with the findings of a prior systematic review 8 . While the number of included studies was small, the higher odds of cesarean section appear to be independent of but worsened by GDM, which is consistent with our previous meta-analysis 8 .  The strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis are the inclusion of the largest number of observational studies and participants across five continents to date. We excluded less reliable diagnostic methods such as self-reported PCOS status and ICD codes, as these can introduce inaccuracies due to recall bias or misinterpretation of the diagnosis and the inherent variability in diagnostic criteria across medical organizations 135 , 136 . Coupled with the heterogeneous nature of PCOS presentations, these less reliable methods can increase the potential for misdiagnosis 137 , 138 , thus capturing those with more severe symptoms and/or those not meeting the diagnostic criteria and distorting the findings on pregnancy outcomes. For the first time, we reported the mean age and BMI corresponding to each outcome of interest and performed cumulative analyses to assess the potential impact of time on the outcomes. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of confounders, and we also performed meta\u2010regression to assess the impact of age and BMI where substantial heterogeneity was observed, a pioneering approach from our previous systematic review. The certainty of evidence was assessed for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach. A limitation of this review is the inclusion of studies that were published in English, which contributes to potential language bias since English studies are more likely to demonstrate positive findings. Other limitations include the unclear or inconsistent definitions for some of the outcomes; small number of studies for sensitivity analyses by age-matched, BMI-matched and high-quality studies; and the insufficient number of studies for meta-analyses on eclampsia and perinatal depression. Furthermore, 64.1% of the included studies were of moderate to high risk of bias mainly due to high confounding bias (57.7%) followed by high selection bias (31.7%); however, we conducted sensitivity analyses of high-quality studies that confirmed the overall findings for the majority of outcomes. As this was a meta-analysis of aggregate-level data, we could only explore confounding factors in relation to age, BMI, or post-ART populations; hence, other potentially important confounders could not be accounted for.  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that women with PCOS are more likely to experience pregnancy complications, which are independent of but likely exacerbated by increased age and BMI and by assisted conception. The increased odds for pregnancy complications were impacted by the quality of the studies. Women with PCOS are more likely to have pregnancy-related obesity, which could be both a risk factor for and a consequence of metabolic disorders in pregnancy. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 106690 pregnancies in women with and without PCOS directly informs the 2023 International Evidence\u2010based PCOS Guideline recommendation to consider PCOS as a risk factor for pregnancy complications in preconception and in antenatal care guidelines to enable timely screening, proper monitoring, and early intervention. Additional risk factors, such as age, BMI and ART, should be considered in women with PCOS. Individual patient data meta-analyses with sufficient statistical power are warranted to further investigate the impact of PCOS features and to clarify important confounders and sources of heterogeneity in the relationship between PCOS and pregnancy outcomes.    Methods   Search strategy and selection criteria  This systematic review and meta-analysis is an update of previously published systematic reviews 8 , 139 and was conducted in accordance with the Meta\u2010Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE) guidelines 140 . Given that the majority of studies on pregnancy outcomes in prospectively identified PCOS come from selected populations with a high-risk profile 141 , we did not prioritize the distinction between retrospective and prospective study designs; rather, our emphasis was on the overall quality of the studies. The protocol for the original review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42017067147). The methods and results of the previous search with the inclusion of publications up to the 4th of April 2017 have been previously published 8 , 139 . The search was limited to English language studies and updated (MBK) from 2017 to 13th of July 2022 through Medline, Medline in\u2010process, and other non\u2010indexed citations, EMBASE, and all EBM reviews, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, American College of Physicians Journal Club, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessments, The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. Bibliographies of recent and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched to identify additional studies. As was done previously, search terms included a broader number of outcomes, distributed to two systematic reviews and meta-analyses 8 , 139 .  Eligible studies included studies reporting observational data on gestational weight gain, miscarriage, GDM, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, induction of labor, instrumental delivery, cesarean section, and perinatal depression in women with and without PCOS. In a protocol amendment, we only included studies in which the criteria used for PCOS diagnosis fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria 136 . Pregnancy outcomes were accepted according to the primary studies\u2019 definitions.  Studies published in languages other than English; case reports, case series, editorials, scoping and narrative reviews; studies using self-reported or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for PCOS diagnosis; and studies not reporting the outcomes of interest in the two groups of PCOS versus non-PCOS were excluded.  Two reviewers (MBK, SH, or SS) independently screened studies by titles and abstracts and reviewed full texts for eligibility. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved through consensus or arbitration between reviewers. Studies identified through the new search were combined with those published before April 2017. Studies not meeting the new criteria needed for PCOS diagnosis were excluded (i.e., studies captured in the 2017 reviews 8 , 139 that used self-report or ICD for PCOS diagnosis were excluded from the current review).    Data analysis  Data extraction and quality appraisal were independently performed by the same reviewers. Using an a priori researcher\u2010developed data extraction form, data were extracted from each study. These included the author, year of publication, study design, study location, participant characteristics, and frequency/mean and standard deviation of outcomes per group. Participant characteristics included age, BMI, mode of conception, existing medical conditions, and medications used during pregnancy.  When participants were overlapping between multiple publications for the same outcome, data from the study with the largest sample size were included in the meta-analysis.  the risk of bias was independently assessed by two reviewers (MBK, SH, or SS) using the Newcastle\u2010Ottawa Scale (NOS) for non\u2010randomized studies for selection, comparability, and outcome ascertainment 142 . Studies were considered high-quality if they scored at least three stars in selection, one star in comparability, and two stars in outcome ascertainment. Studies with two stars in selection, a minimum of one star in comparability, and two stars in outcome ascertainment were considered fair quality. Studies meeting neither of these two thresholds were considered low quality.  We performed random-effects meta-analyses to generate pooled effect estimates, reported as the mean differences (MDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the association between PCOS status and pregnancy outcomes. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I\u00b2 statistic; I\u00b2 above 50% was deemed substantial heterogeneity 143 . Sensitivity analyses were performed, excluding studies in which participants were taking metformin after conception or conceived after bariatric surgery. Cumulative random-effects meta\u2010analyses based on Hedge\u2019s adjusted g and its 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 144 were performed to explore the effect of time (publication year) on the association of PCOS with each outcome of interest. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system 145 using Gradepro software 146 .  Sensitivity analyses of the outcomes by conception with ART (in vitro fertilization, in vitro maturation intracytoplasmic sperm injection, zygote intrafallopian transfer, and gamete intro-fallopian transfer) and prospective and high-quality studies as well as by age- and BMI-matched designs were also performed after exclusion of studies in which women were taking metformin after conception or conceived after bariatric surgery.  Restricted maximum likelihood (REML)\u2010based random effects meta\u2010regression was performed to explore the effects of variations in age and BMI on each outcome of interest if there were equal to or greater than 10 studies per coefficient. Effect sizes of age and BMI for individual studies were used in meta\u2010regression analyses. The percentage of between-study variance explained by the model (tau 2 ) was estimated using the Knapp\u2013Hartung modification. Normal distributions for mean values were checked using skewness\u2010kurtosis tests. As age and BMI were not both significant ( p <\u20090.01) for any of the outcomes on univariate meta\u2010regression analyses, multivariable meta\u2010regression could not be performed. Statistical significance was defined as two-sided P <\u2009\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 17 (StataCorp, 14 College Station, Texas, USA).
