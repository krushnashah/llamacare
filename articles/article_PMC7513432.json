    "body": "Introduction  Individuals with gender incongruence have been present\nthroughout history. In the last several decades, due to greater societal acceptance and\nincreased medical insurance coverage, more transgender individuals are seeking medical\ncare. Hormone treatment comprises a key part of the transition process for many\ntransgender individuals. As knowledge in this field evolves, questions arise about the\nrole of hormones in gender identity and expression.  Observations of individuals\nwith gene mutations affecting androgen metabolism suggest a possible relationship\nbetween hormone levels and gender identity. For example, in 5-alpha-reductase 2\ndeficiency, there is reduced conversion of testosterone to the more active hormone\ndihydrotestosterone [ 1 ]. Imperato-McGinley et al . described a cohort of\n46XY individuals with this disorder, most of whom were born with female or ambiguous\nexternal genitalia (but male internal urogenital tract), leading many to be reared as\ngirls [ 2 ]. After the onset of puberty, virilization occurs (the phallus enlarges and\ntestes descend). Seventeen out of eighteen of the children reared as girls in\nImperato-McGinley\u2019s cohort changed to male identity after puberty [ 2 ]. In another\ngenetic condition, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, precursors in the adrenal steroidogenesis\npathway are shunted towards androgen production ( Figure 1 ). Excess androgen exposure\nleads to ambiguous genitalia at birth in 46XX individuals which are associated with\nvariations in gender roles and behavior [ 3 , 4 ]. These findings will be discussed in more\ndetail later.  In this review, we explore the relationship between polycystic\novary syndrome (PCOS) and gender identity and expression. PCOS is a common endocrine\ndisorder of 46XX reproductive-age individuals who were assigned female at birth (AFAB).\nMost PCOS individuals have clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism. Because\nandrogens may affect gender identity as discussed earlier, we explored the PCOS\nliterature which examined a potential relationship between PCOS and gender\nincongruence.  We first discuss the pathogenesis of PCOS, its symptoms and\ntreatment. We then examine the literature which addresses the prevalence of PCOS in\nindividuals with gender incongruence and conversely, the prevalence of gender\nincongruence in those with PCOS. It is important to screen for PCOS because it is\nassociated with metabolic and fertility issues. We finally attempt to draw some\nconclusions regarding the relationship between PCOS and gender incongruence and propose\nfuture areas of investigation into this important topic.  Our use of the term\n\u201cgender incongruence\u201d draws from the descriptions provided by the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of\nDiseases (ICD) as a condition in which one\u2019s experienced or expressed gender is\npersistently incongruous with their gender assigned at birth. It is important to\nacknowledge, of course, that this condition is not a mental disorder or a disease. In\naddition, the DSM and ICD nomenclature has changed with each new edition \u2013 the condition\nwas termed \u201ctranssexualism\u201d and \u201cgender identity disorder of childhood\u201d in the ICD-10\nand \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d in the DSM-IV [ 5 , 6 ]. In the DSM-V (the most recent\nedition), it is termed \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d [ 7 ]. In the upcoming ICD-11, it will be named\n\u201cgender incongruence\u201d and will be moved out of the \u201cmental and behavioral disorders\u201d\nchapter into the \u201csexual health\u201d chapter in an effort to destigmatize gender variance\n[ 8 ]. The definitions for this condition have also evolved, though the DSM-IV and V both\nstipulate that clinical distress or impairment in functioning must be associated with\nthe incongruence between the expressed and natal gender [ 5 , 7 ]. In this review we will\nuse the term \u201cgender incongruence\u201d for general discussion. When addressing individual\nstudies, we will cite the nomenclature used by the authors.    PCOS:\nDiagnostic Criteria and Clinical Manifestations  PCOS affects 5% to 20% of\n46XX reproductive-age individuals [ 9 ]. Most consensus definitions characterize PCOS as a\ndisorder of chronic anovulation and either clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism with\nexclusion of other conditions with similar phenotypes ( e.g. 21-hydroxylase deficiency, androgen secreting tumors, Cushing\u2019s syndrome,\netc.).  Three sets of diagnostic criteria of PCOS exist. They were proposed by the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990, Rotterdam Consensus conference in 2003, and\nAndrogen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) in 2009. NIH criteria require the presence of\nmenstrual abnormalities (oligo- or anovulation) and either clinical or biochemical\nhyperandrogenism of ovarian origin [ 10 ]. Rotterdam criteria require the presence of two\nout of the three following features once other causes of hyperandrogenism have been\nexcluded: oligo- or amenorrhea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic\novary morphology on ultrasound [ 11 ]. AES criteria define PCOS as the presence of\nclinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation\nand/or polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound), and the exclusion of other\ndisorders [ 12 ].  Clinical manifestations vary among individuals with PCOS (Figure\n2). While not all individuals with PCOS have biochemical hyperandrogenism, the majority\ndo. Recent cohort studies examining individuals who have PCOS by the most widely used\ncriteria (Rotterdam 2003) estimate the prevalence of hyperandrogenemia to be 46% to 85%,\nwith most studies citing rates of >50% [ 13 - 17 ]. Clinical signs of hyperandrogenism\ninclude hirsutism, seborrhea, acne, and alopecia. Evidence of virilization, such as\nclitoromegaly, may be present in some cases. In addition, individuals may have chronic\nanovulation, presenting with infertility or menstrual irregularities such as\noligo/amenorrhea or dysfunctional uterine bleeding.  PCOS is also associated with\ninsulin resistance (commonly manifesting as acanthosis nigricans), impaired glucose\ntolerance, increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and visceral\nobesity ( Figure 2 ) [ 18 , 19 ]. Additionally, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and\nendometrial carcinoma has been observed in those with PCOS\n[ 20 , 21 ].    Genetics and Hormonal Abnormalities in PCOS  PCOS\nappears to be a complex genetic syndrome in which comorbid conditions and environmental\nfactors interact with genetic variants. Over 100 genes have been examined as potential\ncandidates for a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS but none has been shown to be the\nprimary driver of this condition [ 22 ].  Two main endocrine theories of PCOS have\nbeen proposed [ 23 ]. The central theory posits that there is an\nabnormally increased pulsatile secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from\nthe hypothalamus that causes a tonically increased secretion of LH instead of the usual\npulsatile pattern [ 24 ]. LH levels may also rise due to hyperandrogenism [ 25 ].\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is normal or decreased due to negative\nfeedback leading to increased LH:FSH ratio. The ovarian theory postulates that an alteration in the ovarian steroid synthesis pathway is responsible\nfor increased androgen production. For example, dysregulation of the enzyme cytochrome\nP450c17-alpha, which comprises 17-hydroxylase and 17/20 lyase activities, results in\nincreased production of testosterone precursors and ultimately increased circulating\ntestosterone levels [ 26 ].    Insulin Resistance and\nHyperinsulinemia  Insulin sensitivity is affected by many independent factors,\nincluding obesity, muscle mass, and site of body fat deposition (central vs peripheral).\nThe etiology of insulin resistance in PCOS is unclear, although abnormalities of insulin\nreceptor signaling have been reported [ 27 ]. Elevated circulating levels of free fatty\nacids (FFA) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) have also been reported in PCOS [ 28 , 29 ].\nIncreased FFA flux into liver decreases hepatic insulin extraction and produces\nhyperinsulinemia. TNF-\u03b1 produced by adipose tissue leads to insulin resistance and\ninhibition of the insulin receptor signaling cascade. Elevated serum insulin levels in\nPCOS result in excessive ovarian androgen production as well as ovarian growth and cyst\nformation [ 30 , 31 ].  The system of ovarian regulation by insulin, insulin-like\ngrowth factors (IGFs) and their receptors is complex [ 24 ]. Activation of alternative\ninsulin signaling pathways via type 1 IGF receptors (possibly up-regulated by\nhyperinsulinemia), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3)\nactivation help preserve ovarian sensitivity to insulin even in insulin resistant states\n[ 25 ]. The gonadotrophic activity of insulin includes direct stimulatory effects on\nsteroidogenic enzymes, synergism with FSH and LH, and enhancement of pituitary\nresponsiveness to GnRH. Insulin also suppresses hepatic production of sex hormone\nbinding globulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulatory levels of free steroid hormones\n[ 32 ]. Additionally, insulin increases expression of PPAR-\u03b3 whose activation affects\nsteroidogenesis [ 33 ]. These effects of insulin on ovaries can account for many PCOS\nfeatures in hyper-insulinemic insulin-resistant individuals and are important in\ndeveloping therapeutic strategies.    Treatment Options  There\nare numerous treatment modalities that should be tailored to the patient\u2019s specific\npresentations and concerns. Lifestyle changes improve multiple aspects of PCOS. A 5% to\n10% reduction in body weight can reduce insulin resistance, decrease circulating\nandrogens, restore ovulation, and increase pregnancy rates [ 34 ]. Exercise, even if it\ndoes not produce this degree of weight loss, results in improved menstrual regularity,\nincreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased hirsutism [ 35 - 37 ]. Insulin resistance can\nbe reduced also by insulin sensitizers such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs).\nMetformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases sensitivity of adipose tissue\nand muscle to insulin, resulting in reductions in insulin and androgen levels. Metformin\nalso improves menstrual regularity, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate [ 38 , 39 ]. TZDs,\nwhich activate PPAR-\u03b3, improve insulin sensitivity. As insulin levels fall, ovulation\nrates improve and SHBG levels rise. Improvement in androgen level and ovulation is\nsimilar to that seen with metformin [ 40 ]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor\nagonists reduce body weight and thus increase insulin sensitivity [ 25 ].  Oral\ncontraceptives (OCPs) regulate menstrual cycles and decrease androgen levels by\ninhibiting synthesis of GnRH at the hypothalamus. They also increase hepatic production\nof SHBG, thus decreasing circulating free androgen levels. Anti-androgen medications\nsuch as spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, finasteride, and flutamide may be used to\nreduce androgen levels and manifestations of hyperandrogenism [ 41 ].  Fertility\noptions in PCOS include the partial estrogen receptor antagonist clomiphene, which\ninterferes with the negative feedback of estrogen in the hypothalamus, resulting in\nincreased FSH secretion leading to follicular growth. Because of improved ovulation\nrates and cost-effectiveness, clomiphene is frequently used for ovulation induction\n[ 42 ]. However, recent studies indicate that letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor which\nblocks peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens, produces higher pregnancy and\nlive-birth rates than clomiphene, making it a leading candidate for first-line treatment\n[ 43 , 44 ]. Other fertility treatment options include exogenous gonadotrophin\nadministration, in vitro fertilization, and laparoscopic ovarian\ndrilling [ 34 ].    Prevalence of PCOS in Transgender\nPatients  Prior to the publication of the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, three\nstudies showed a wide range in prevalence (5%-91.7%) of PCOS in hormone-na\u00efve\ntransmasculine (TM) individuals [ 45 - 47 ]. Of note, reviewed studies used various\nterminology including \u201ctranssexual females to males\u201d or \u201cFTM\u201d to describe individuals\nAFAB who seek gender transition using testosterone. There was no indication that gender\nnonbinary individuals were included. We use the abbreviation TM when referring to the\nstudies\u2019 cohorts. In the earliest of these studies, Futterweit et al .\nfound that 5% of their cohort of 40 multiracial TM patients \u201cunequivocally\u201d had PCOS if\nthey met the criteria of having enlarged multifollicular ovaries (seen on pathology\nafter laparotomy) and at least one of the following two symptoms: hirsutism or\noligomenorrhea ( Table 1 ) [ 45 ]. Since these were very stringent criteria for definitively\ndiagnosing PCOS, the authors categorized 22.5% of their subjects as \u201cprobably\u201d having\nPCOS by the criteria of: \u201c(1) a combination of hirsutism and/or oligomenorrhea with a\nborderline or increased plasma testosterone level and/or a plasma LH/FSH ratio >2.0;\nand/or (2) ultrasonographic evidence of increased ovarian volume with multiple follicle\ncysts.\u201d Of note, 20% of their cohort would have met Rotterdam 2003 criteria for PCOS.\nThe rate of hirsutism in this cohort was 30%. In a subset of 29 patients who had total\ntestosterone measured, 31% had borderline (>80 ng/dl) or elevated (>100 ng/dl)\ncirculating testosterone levels. On average, TM individuals had higher total\ntestosterone levels than the control group of cis women.  A subsequent study in a\ngroup of 16 British TM patients found a PCOS prevalence of 43.8% using the criteria of\nirregular periods, hyperandrogenemia, and polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound\n[ 46 ]. Fifty percent of these individuals exhibited hirsutism. In a 1997 German study,\n83% of TM patients had hyperandrogenemia and 11 out of 12 met PCOS criteria defined as\nhaving two of the following signs/symptoms: irregular periods, hyperandrogenemia, and\npolycystic ovarian ultrasound appearance [ 47 ]. However, after cosyntropin stimulation\ntesting, 50% (n=6) of the TM patients were found to have non-classical congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), a condition which causes hyperandrogenism and irregular\nperiods. This raises the consideration that the prevalence of PCOS in earlier studies\nmay have been inflated by the presence of undiagnosed mimicking conditions such as\nNCCAH.  In a 2007 study of 69 Japanese TM transgender patients prior to gender\naffirming treatment, 58% had PCOS by Rotterdam criteria and 39% had hyperandrogenemia\n[ 48 ]. In this study, while patients with PCOS were more likely to have elevated androgen\nlevels (as expected) than those who did not have PCOS, hyperandrogenemia was also more\nprevalent in obese vs lean TM patients. When stratified by BMI, however, TM patients\nwith PCOS still had higher androgen levels than those without PCOS, confirming that PCOS\nis associated with hyperandrogenemia regardless of fat mass.  A more recent study\nfrom Germany explored the prevalence of PCOS (diagnosed by both the NIH 1990 and\nRotterdam 2003 criteria) in 61 hormone-na\u00efve TM individuals compared to 94 cis women\nwithout known medical disorders [ 49 ]. Vaginal ultrasound to assess for polycystic\novarian morphology was obtained in both groups. Hyperandrogenism was defined as a\nmodified Ferriman Galwey score of \u2265 6 or elevated circulating free testosterone \u2265 0.028\nnmol/liter. The Ferriman Galwey method is a semiquantitative assessment of hair growth\nin which higher grades indicate denser hair in more areas of the body [ 50 ]. Participants\nwere deemed anovulatory if their menstrual cycles were longer than 35 days or if\nmid-luteal phase progesterone was \u2264 4 ng/mL. Other androgen excess disorders such as\nNCCAH, androgen-secreting neoplasms, and hyperandrogenic insulin-resistant acanthosis\nnigricans were excluded (ACTH stimulation test and computed tomography of the adrenal\nglands were used to rule out the first two conditions). No difference was found in PCOS\nrates between TM individuals and controls \u2013 11.5% in TM individuals vs 9.6% in controls\nby NIH criteria (p=0.9) and 14.8% vs 12.8% by Rotterdam criteria (p=0.9). TM individuals\ndid have a greater prevalence of hyperandrogenemia compared to controls (44.3% vs 20.3%,\np=0.002) but there was no difference in hirsutism.  Thus, although earlier studies\nfound relatively high rates of PCOS in several international TM populations, diagnostic\ncriteria for PCOS varied and the presence of other androgen excess disorders may have\ncaused overestimation of PCOS prevalence. A more recent study using two widely accepted\ncriteria for PCOS, rigorous testing for PCOS components, and evaluations which ruled out\nsimilar disorders did not show a higher rate of PCOS in TM people. These studies,\nhowever, did show high rates of hyperandrogenism in TM\nindividuals.    Self-Perception and Gender Identity in PCOS\npatients  We also reviewed the literature to determine self-perceptions of\ngender roles, femininity, and the prevalence of gender incongruence in PCOS patients\ngiven that many have biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism. A study which used the\nAES criteria for PCOS did not find a difference in gender roles between adolescents with\nPCOS and cis female peers without PCOS [ 51 ]. Another small study showed that individuals\nAFAB who self-identified as being diagnosed with PCOS recalled less feminine behavior\nand less gender conformity in childhood compared to controls but no difference as\nadolescents and adults [ 52 ]. Qualitative studies report an alteration of the female\ngender scheme in adults with PCOS [ 53 - 55 ]. These studies examined self-reported\npersonality traits, attitudes, social roles, and behaviors associated with symptoms of\nPCOS. They did not assess for the presence of gender incongruence/dysphoria, which is a\ndistinct entity. The current DSM-V criteria for \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d specifies a marked\nincongruence between one\u2019s experienced/expressed gender and natal gender of 6 months or\nmore in duration, associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in\nfunctioning [ 7 ].  When the prevalence of \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d was studied in\nPCOS patients, there was no difference compared to control women after adjusting for\ncomorbidity with any psychiatric disorder [ 56 ]. In this large Swedish population study\n(24,385 PCOS patients), subjects were included if they had a diagnosis of PCOS by ICD-9\nor 10 and did not have a diagnosis of mimicking conditions such as congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (CAH), adrenal tumor, or Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Because participant selection\nwas made based on ICD coding, it is possible that some participants diagnosed with PCOS\nmay have been misclassified since entering a diagnostic code depends on the judgement of\nthe clinical provider. The mode and vigor of work-up for conditions that present\nsimilarly to PCOS may have varied in this population, leading to false positive\ndiagnosis of PCOS. Additionally, it is possible that patients who did in fact have PCOS\ndid not have the proper coding in their medical chart, leading to exclusion from the\nstudy.    Comparison to Another Disorder of Androgen Excess \u2013 Congenital\nAdrenal Hyperplasia  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is another condition\nin which 46XX individuals can be exposed to high levels of androgens. In this disorder,\nprecursors for cortisol and aldosterone are shunted towards androgen-synthesizing\npathways due to enzyme deficiencies ( Figure 1 ). Androgen exposure occurs in\nutero , often leading to genital virilization present at birth, whereas in\nPCOS hyperandrogenemia occurs after the onset of puberty. However, similar to PCOS,\nstudies suggest that gender roles and behavior in 46XX patients with CAH may differ from\nthose in the general 46XX population. Studies prior to the 1990s reported that in 46XX\nchildren with classical CAH, behaviors shift from female-typical towards male-typical in\nterms of juvenile play, clothing and style preference, athletic activity, career\ninterest, and adult sexual behavior [ 57 , 58 ]. Satisfaction with the female sex role was\nhigher in control children AFAB than in 46XX children with CAH [ 57 ]. However, those in\nthe latter group who thought it was preferable to be a boy did not believe that they\nwere assigned to the wrong gender. In a more recent study exploring gender development\nas a function of CAH severity, there was a greater degree of self-reported male-typical\nself-perception and behavior in 46XX individuals as the severity of the condition\nincreased [ 3 ].  In a 2003 study in which individuals AFAB who were 18 years old or\nyounger took part in a gender identity interview, 46XX children with CAH scored in\nbetween \u201ccontrol girls\u201d and \u201ctomboys\u201d on the spectrum from complete female-typical\nidentity to complete male-typical identity [ 4 ]. Age was not correlated with gender\nidentity in this study. The \u201ctomboy\u201d group was recruited through newspaper articles\nasking parents who perceive their daughters to be tomboys to enroll them in the study\n(investigators did not provide a definition of \u201ctomboy\u201d to parents). A 2014 study found\nthat compared to control children AFAB, 46XX children with CAH were more likely to show\ncross-gender identification as assessed by questions derived from part A of the\ndiagnostic criteria for \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d in the DSM-IV-TR [ 59 ]. This trend was\nindependent of gender role behavior. It is important to note that this study was not\ndesigned to diagnose gender incongruence in children and did not assess part D of the\nDSM-IV criteria for \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d which requires clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in functioning (retained in the current DSM-V as part B)\n[ 7 ].    Conclusions and Outlook  PCOS is a syndrome\ncharacterized by clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation\nmanifesting as irregular periods, and polycystic ovaries. Many individuals with PCOS\nexhibit insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia of unknown etiology, often related to\nobesity. A variety of symptom-driven therapeutic regimens is available. Future research\nmay allow improvement of therapy by identifying specific molecular variants in\nindividual patients.  The cardinal features of PCOS \u2013 hyperandrogenism (either\nclinical or biochemical) and irregular periods \u2013 may affect individuals\u2019 perceptions of\ntheir femininity, social roles, and behavior but current evidence does not clearly\nindicate that PCOS is associated with gender incongruence. Older studies using small\nconvenience samples showed that hormone-na\u00efve TM people had a higher prevalence of PCOS\nand hyperandrogenism than the general population.\u200b However, the diagnostic criteria for\nPCOS were not uniform in these studies and the presence of other androgen excess\ndisorders may have inflated the rates of PCOS. A more recent, larger study using\nestablished criteria for diagnosing PCOS did not show higher PCOS prevalence in TM\nindividuals. \u200bIn addition, although PCOS patients are less likely to identify with a\ntraditional feminine gender scheme compared to age-matched peers, the prevalence of\ngender incongruence in PCOS patients is not higher than in the general population.\nModerate androgen excess early in development (as seen in the genetic disorder CAH)\nappears to be associated with a higher risk of male-typical preferences and behavior,\nwhich is likely independent of its association with gender identity. Larger, systemic\nstudies with control groups using modern diagnostic criteria for gender incongruence are\nneeded to examine the association of early and late androgen exposure on gender\nidentity. CAH has been shown to be a good model of early androgen exposure. To identify\npatients with late androgen exposure, it is likely feasible to first identify PCOS\npatients and then recruit only those who have biochemical hyperandrogenism. Gender\nincongruence can then be studied in a cohort of people assigned female at birth who have\nelevated circulating androgen levels.",
