    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most important diseases related to the ovarian problems, affecting 6\u201315% of women of reproductive age [ 1 , 2 ]. PCOS involves a series of symptoms, such as weight gain, menstrual irregularities, ovulation disorder, etc., that are caused by excess androgen production. Furthermore, disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary\u2013gonadal axis, folliculogenesis, insulin production and sensitivity, hormone profile, and estrogen synthesis may result from increases in androgens [ 3 ].  Steroid hormones affect some ovarian functions via autocrine or paracrine pathways via estrogen receptors (ESRs) [ 4 ]. ESRs (ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2) are expressed in granulosa cells (GCs), and theca cells (TCs) in developing follicles [ 5 ]. ESR\u03b2 activation stimulates follicular growth, and reduces atresia [ 5 ]. In contrast, ESR\u03b1 activation inhibits the ovulation probably via affecting the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis and uterine growth. The expression levels of these receptors in the cumulus cells (CCs) of patients with PCOS are significantly lower than those of healthy controls [ 6 ]. Previous studies showed that epigenetic changes play a definite role in the steroidogenic activity in GCs and TCs of follicles [ 7 ].  Epigenome changes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, now play an important role in defining the etiology of PCOS [ 8 ]. DNA methylation is accomplished by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs), which are divided into three classes in mammals: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. The acetylation of histones is one of the main types of histone modifications that occur by the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes [ 9 ]. Epigenetic changes may lead to abnormal gene expression, thereby predisposing individuals to develop PCOS [ 10 ]. Pathways related to adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose control, and immunological function showed aberrant patterns in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscles of PCOS patients when DNA methylation and transcriptional patterns were analyzed [ 11 , 12 ]. Furthermore, such changes were reported in DNA methylation and transcriptional patterns of the ovary [ 13 ], GCs [ 14 ], CCs [ 7 ], and TCs [ 15 ] in PCOS patients. However, little is known about the effects of ovarian epigenetics modifications on the pathophysiology of PCOS and there is still no effective treatment for PCOS. Currently, using stem cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), was suggested as a novel promising therapy for the restoration of ovarian function, and the regulation of steroidogenesis in terms of their paracrine-induced anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic factors secreted by stem cells [ 16 ]. Reports show that transplantation of MSCs derived from the placenta [ 17 ], menstrual blood [ 18 ] and bone marrow [ 19 ] can improve ovarian structure, and function in a murine model of premature ovarian failure (POF) by inhibiting apoptosis and repairing DNA damage, resulting in germ cell protection [ 20 ].  Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ASC) are considered an ideal candidate in medicine in terms of their easy isolation, self-renewal ability, as well as their ability to differentiate and proliferate properly [ 21 ]. ASC secretes a range of growth factors, immunological regulators, and cytokines. Instead of developing into certain cells, they may also lessen free radicals by secreting antioxidant substances, which enhances ovarian function via their paracrine actions [ 21 ]. Besides, the potential risk of immune reactions and cancer development, has raised several safety concerns related to MSC\u2019s transplantation [ 22 ]. Thus, poor engraftment and insufficient viability of transplanted cells restrict their therapeutic efficacy [ 23 ]. Conditioned medium (CM) rich in various stem cell-derived secreted factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, lipids, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), regulatory miRNAs, secretomes, microvesicles, and exosomes were proposed as an alternative to MSCs, where applicable [ 24 \u2013 26 ]. The positive effects of these factors have been reported in the treatment of male and female infertility [ 27 \u2013 29 ]. Transplantation of MSCs, and MSC-CM into POF model ovaries has improved the microenvironment, ovarian reserve, and performance, as well as fertility rate by reducing apoptosis in GCs and ovarian interstitial fibrosis [ 30 ]. Furthermore, the in vitro maturation (IVM) rate of oocytes cultured in media containing ASC-conditioned medium (ASC-CM) was higher than that of ASC alone [ 31 ].  Since no data are available to compare the effects of ASC and ASC-CM transplantation in the PCOS model, we aimed to investigate the effects of ASC and ASC-CM transplantations on epigenetic alterations, folliculogenesis, and estrogenic activity in the ovaries of PCOS model Wistar rats.    Methods and materials   Animals and maintenance method  In this experimental study, adults (180\u2013220\u00a0g) female Wistar rats were purchased from the animal house of Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman, Iran. The experiments were performed with the permission of the ethics Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (approval number: IR.KMU.AH.REC.1400.195) and the animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (12/12\u00a0h cycle of light and dark; at 22- 25 \u25e6 C). After 10\u00a0days of acclimatization, a daily vaginal smear was prepared and only those animals that had at least two consecutive normal estrus cycles were included in the experiment [ 19 ].    Experimental design  Sixty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) group which received a 1% aqueous solution of CMC orally once daily (vehicle group, n =\u200910) and the PCOS groups, which received 1\u00a0mg/kg letrozole (Tehran, Iran) in 1% CMC orally once daily (PCOS group, n =\u200950) for 21\u00a0days [ 32 ]. After confirming the PCOS model, the animals in the PCOS group were divided into four subgroups: 1- Adipose mesenchymal stem cell receiving group (ASC, n =\u200910) that 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 passage 4 ASC suspended in 20\u00a0\u00b5l medium were transplanted into the ovaries of PCOS rat model [ 19 , 33 ], 2- ASC-conditioned medium group (ASC-CM, n =\u200910) which received 20\u00a0\u00b5l ASC-CM into the ovaries of PCOS rat model, 3- control group (CTRL, n =\u200910) and 4- sham group (Sham, n =\u200910) which received 20\u00a0\u00b5l culture medium and normal saline into the ovaries of PCOS rat model, respectively.  Vaginal smears were obtained daily from the 10 th day to the last day of the experiment for each group and the smears were evaluated under a light microscope (Olympus IX51, Japan) after staining with hematoxylin [ 34 ]. Four weeks after transplantation [ 19 ], the animals were deeply anaesthetized with 40\u00a0mg/kg ketamine and 4\u00a0mg/kg xylazine, the blood was taken from the left ventricle and the serum was separated from the blood sample by centrifugation at 3,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min, and kept refrigerated for serum estradiol measurement then the ovaries were immediately removed for the rest of the experiments.    Induction of PCOS model  To induce the PCOS model, female rats received 1\u00a0mg/kg letrozole dissolved in 1% CMC orally once a daily for 21\u00a0days (PCOS groups, N =\u200950). The CMC group received only 1% CMC (vehicle group, N =\u200910) [ 32 ]. The animals underwent daily vaginal smear examination to confirm PCOS. To check the prolongation of metestrus and diestrus phases was considered as the main sign of PCOS, then it was reinforced by positive intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and an increase in the number of ovarian cysts and decrease in the number of corpus luteum.    Glucose tolerance test  On the last day of the PCOS induction and treatment, the animals were fasted for 12\u201314\u00a0h (8\u00a0pm to 8 am). The next morning, their blood was taken from tail veins. In order to evaluate glucose tolerance, rats received an i.p dose of 2\u00a0g/kg glucose and their blood glucose was measured at different time points (30, 60 and 120\u00a0min) using a standard glucometer (CareSens, i-SENS, Inc, South Korea). The area under the glucose tolerance curve (AUC) was calculated during the 120-min sampling period [ 35 ].    Body weight and tissue sampling  The body weight of animals was recorded every week from the first day to the end of the treatment period using a digital scale (Sartorius, Japan). After the animals were sacrificed, the ovaries were collected, washed with normal saline, and the excess fat covering the ovaries was removed. Right ovaries were stored at\u2009\u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C for gene expression assays, while the left ovaries were weighed, and their length and width were measured using a digital caliper (Sartorius, Japan), and then fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for histomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was calculated as (ovary weight/body weight)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. Weight gain was also calculated as ([final weight \u2013 initial weight] /initial weight\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) [ 36 ].    Serum estradiol assay  Four weeks after transplantation, a blood sample was collected from the heart of the anesthetized animals in the diestrus phase at 8\u20139 AM. [ 37 ]. The samples were centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min. The serums were extracted and kept at -20 \u00baC until hormone analysis. 17-\u03b2 estradiol was measured using a specific kit (Monobind,\u00a0Inc., U.S.)and ELISA reader instrument. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of three replicates of each sample in a single assay was 8.1% and the inter-assay CV with analysis of the same samples ( n =\u20096) in two separate runs was 9.3%.    Ovarian follicle counts  The ovaries were dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and serially sectioned at 5-\u03bcm thickness. From every 10 serial sections, one section was selected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (eight sections from each rat). Folliculogenesis was investigated by determination of different types of follicles based on the following criteria: 1- primordial follicles: an oocyte surrounded by a layer of squamous follicular cells, 2- primary follicles: an oocyte surrounded by a layer of cuboidal GCs, 3- secondary follicles: an oocyte surrounded by several layers of cube-shaped GCs without cavities, 4- pre-antral follicle: an oocyte surrounded by several layers of cube-shaped GCs with several small cavities between the cells, 5- antral follicle: an oocyte surrounded CCs in a space filled with liquid and several layers of GCs, 6- pre-ovulatory follicle: an oocyte surrounded by CCs and a large cavity around the cumulus-oophores-complex (COC), 7- Ovarian cysts with large cavities surrounded by GCs and absence of a COC, and finally 8- corpus luteum, multilayered GCs and TCs in the periphery of the ovary [ 19 , 38 ].    Culture and identification of ASC and preparation of ASC-CM  ASC was obtained from a frozen cell batch in our laboratory at Afzalipour faculty of medical sciences, Kerman, Iran. Flow cytometry was used to characterize the mesenchymal origin of ASC by analyzing the expression of cell surface CD markers, namely CD34 \u2212 , CD45 \u2212 , CD90 + , and CD105 + . In addition, the ASC were differentiated into adipogenic (50\u00a0mg/ml indomethacin, 100\u00a0nM dexamethasone and 50\u00a0mg/ml ascorbic acid) and osteogenic (10\u00a0mM b-glycerophosphate, 10\u00a0nM dexamethasone and 50\u00a0mg/ml ascorbic acid) linage for 21\u00a0days. Half of the culture medium was refreshed every 3\u00a0days. Adipocyte-like cells and osteoblast-like cells were determined using Oil Red O and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively [ 39 ].  The harvested cells were cultured and expanded in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100\u00a0mg/mL of streptomycin and incubated at 37\u02daC with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Two days later, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium to remove debris [ 39 ].  To obtain the ASC\u2010CM, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 4 cells/cm 2 passages four to six were seeded in T75 tissue culture flask and after reaching to 80% to 90% confluence, the cells were washed three times with PBS. Then, they were incubated in a serum\u2010free DMEM culture medium for 48\u00a0h and the CM was collected, concentrated 10 times (10\u2009\u00d7) by centrifugation at 7500\u00a0rpm for 25\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C using 3\u2010kDa molecular weight (MW) cutoff filter units (Millipore; Burlington, MA), and then stored at\u2009\u2212\u200970\u00a0\u00b0C until use [ 40 ].    Transplantation and tracking of ASC  ASC (2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 at passage 4 to 6) were washed twice with PBS, pre-labeled with a red fluorescent dye; PKH26 (Sigma, US), suspended in 20\u00a0\u03bcl culture medium and then directly injected into the bilateral ovaries of ASC group ( n =\u20094) [ 19 ]. Four weeks after transplantation, paraffin-embedded sections were prepared and the labeled cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX71, Japan) [ 41 ].    Quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)  The mRNA expression levels of the main enzymes involved in the epigenetic modification (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC1 and HDAC2) and estrogen receptors (ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2) were evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from frozen right ovary using TRIzol (CINNAGEN, Iran) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol [ 42 ]. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA were determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo fisher scientific, Wilmington, DE, United States) and electrophoresis, respectively. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA (1\u00a0\u03bcg) by a thermocycler (BIOMETRA, Germany) using a reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. To evaluate the expression levels of the different genes, 1\u00a0\u03bcl of the synthesized cDNA and 6\u00a0\u03bcl SYBR green master mix (Genaxxon bioscience, Ulm, Germany) were used in a total reaction volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcl using a Light Cycler Real-Time PCR System (MIC, Queensland, Australia). The sequences of the specific primers used are listed in Table 1 . The relative expression of each gene was determined and normalized to the expression of housekeeping gene beta actin (\u03b2-actin), and calculated using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.

Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100, 95, 80, and 70). Then, antigen retrieval was performed in 0.01\u00a0M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and high microwave irradiation for 25\u00a0min, followed by endogenous peroxidase blocking using TBS/H 2 O 2 at room temperature for 30\u00a0min. The slides were washed three times in PBS-tween 20 (0.05%) for 5\u00a0min, and permeabilized in 0.5% triton for 10\u00a0min. Thereafter, they were incubated with a rat anti-5mC monoclonal antibody (RM231; cat.no. ab214727, Abcam, US, 1:40) and a rat anti-5hmC monoclonal antibody (RM236; cat.no. ab214728, Abcam, US, 1:40) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After three washes in PBS for 20\u00a0min, the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (cat.no. ab64261, Abcam, US, 1:40) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, the slides were incubated with 0.5\u00a0mg/ml diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride 2-hydrate (DAB, Boster bio-engineering, USA) for 5\u00a0min. After washing in PBS for 10\u00a0min, they were mounted and protein expression of 5mC and 5hmC was visualized using a light microscope (Nikon, Japan)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 magnification. The intensity of images were analyzed using ImageJ Fiji software (version 1.52; WS Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA) based on a validated protocol [ 43 ].    Western blot analysis of ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2 protein  Ovarian tissue of each sample (40\u00a0mg) was homogenized by lysis buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA and 0.1\u00a0mM EGTA) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and the supernatant was collected. We used the Bradford method to determine the protein concentration of the supernatant. Equal amounts of protein (10\u00a0\u00b5g) were incubated with a 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009gel loading buffer and separated at 10% SDS-PAGE for two hours, before transferring to PVDF membranes (Roche, West Sussex, UK). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T. Afterward, blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibodies including anti-ESR\u03b1, anti-ESR\u03b2 and anti-\u03b2-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA, 1:300). The membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, washed three times with TBS-T and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, USA) and exposed to X-ray films (Thermo Scientific). The gray value of each band was analyzed by gel image analysis software (ImageJ), then the ratio of the gray value of the target protein band to that of the internal reference protein band (\u03b2-actin) was calculated [ 44 , 45 ]. 0.5\u20140.7\u00a0mg/ml was used for assays.    Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 16.0) and GraphPad Prism (ver 8.0.1, Graph-Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) software. First, the normality of the variables was checked using the One-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test or the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and/or D\u2019Agostino & Pearson test. If the study parameters had a normal distribution, an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test was used (comparison between two experimental groups; PCOS and CMC groups) and the one-way ANOVA test (comparison between three or more experimental groups) followed by post hoc Tukey\u2019s or, otherwise the nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test were run. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used in timewise comparisons. Data were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM and P values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   PCOS rat model confirmation  To confirm the PCOS model, after the end of the 21-day treatment period, estrus cyclicity, ovarian histopathology, blood glucose levels at different times (0, 30, 60 and 120\u00a0min) and also AUC (glucose clearance rate as reflected by the area under IPGTT curves) were evaluated.  Analysis of vaginal smears showed that the CMC group had a regular estrus cycle for 4 to 5\u00a0days, so that 25.23% of animals in the CMC group were in the diestrus phase. meanwhile, a failure of estrus cyclicity, as a critical characteristic of the PCOS rat model, was observed in PCOS rats, so that they spent 87.96% of their estrus cycle in the diestrus phase (Fig. 1 .A, B). Fig. 1 PCOS rat model characteristics: A , B ; The pie charts refer to the proportions of the different stages of the estrus cycle: proestrus (P), estrus (E), metestrus/diestrus (M/D), A demonstrates a regular estrus cycle in the CMC group, and B ) an irregular estrus cycle, confirmed by an increase in the duration of metestrus and distrus phases in the PCOS group. Histopathological tests: C presence of multiple corpus luteum (CL) and follicles at different developmental stages in the CMC group (stars), D presence of cystic follicles (CF) in the PCOS group.

Repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test was used to analyze IPGTT data. unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test was used for AUC data analysis. Abbreviations: PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; CMC, Carboxymethylcellulose   Also, using histopathology evaluations, the corpus luteum and different developmental stages of follicles, which are indicative of folliculogenesis, were observed normally in the ovaries of the CMC group (Fig. 1 .C), whereas multiple cystic follicles along with no signs of corpus luteum formation or ovulation were found in the ovaries of PCOS rats (Fig. 1 .D).  Moreover, glucose concentration in the IPGTT was significantly different with time [F (2.257, 18.05)\u2009=\u200955.92, P <\u20090.0001] and group [F (1, 8)\u2009=\u200916.70, P =\u20090.0035]. Thirty minutes after glucose loading, the PCOS group had a higher blood glucose level in comparison with the CMC group ( P =\u20090.0113) (Fig. 1 .E). In addition, AUC was significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to the CMC group ( P =\u20090.0080) (Fig. 1 .F).    ASC characteristics  ASC propagated rapidly in vitro and was morphologically similar to fibroblast-like cells (Fig. 2 .a). ASC were multipotent cells, as indicated by their ability to differentiate into adipocytes (round lipid vacuoles visualized with oil red O stain) and osteoblasts (extra cellular matrix mineralization stained red with alizarin red) (Fig. 2 .b, c). ASC was positive for CD105 (74.10%), and CD90 (93.24%), and was negative for hematopoietic markers, namely, CD34 and CD45 (Fig. 2 .d).

Magnification,\u2009\u00d7\u2009100     The effects of ASC and ASC-CM on body weight and ovarian morphometric parameters in PCOS rat model  Animals' body weight was measured weekly for 8 weeks. The two-way repeated measure ANOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the effects of group and time on body weight [F (21, 140) = 3.006, P <0.0001]. Our results showed that the ASC-CM group had markedly lower body weight than the ASC group 8 weeks after treatment ( P = 0.0337; Fig. 4 ). Weight gain in the ASC-CM group was significantly decreased compared to the ASC ( P = 0.0001), Sham ( P = 0.0002), and CTRL ( P =0.0024) groups (Fig. 4 B).

Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. The body mass data were analyzed by a repeated measure two-way ANOVA (time, group) and Tukey\u2019s post hoc test and the body weight gain data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test. Abbreviations: CTRL, Control group; ASC, Adipose stem cell group; ASC-CM, Adipose stem cell-conditioned media group   Also, significant differences were observed in the ovary length and width among all groups, with the ovary length in the ASC-CM and ASC groups lower than the untreated groups (sham and CTRL groups) ( P =0.0156, P =0.0106). The ovary width in the ASC-CM and ASC groups also significantly ( P =0.0019, P =0.0090) was lower than the Sham group (Table 2 ). However, the ovary weight was higher in the ASC-CM group and significantly different in comparison to the ASC, Sham and CTRL groups ( P =0.0263, P =0.0006, P =0.0002) (Table 2 ).

As shown in Table 2 , treatment of PCOS animals with ASC and ASC-CM significantly increased GSI parameter in the ASC-CM and ASC groups compared to that of the Sham ( P =0.0040, P =0.0082) and CTRL groups ( P =0.0103, P =0.0207).    Serum estradiol assay  As is shown in Fig. 5 , a significant increase was detected in the serum estradiol level of the ASC-CM group compared to the sham ( P =\u20090.0002) and CTRL ( P =\u20090.0351) groups (Fig. 5 ).

Abbreviations: CTRL, Control group; ASC, Adipose stem cell group; ASC-CM, Adipose stem cell-conditioned media group     The Effects of ASC and ASC-CM on the follicular development in the PCOS rat model  As shown in Table 3 , no significant changes in the mean number of primordial, secondary and pre-ovulatory follicles were observed among groups, while the mean number of primary and pre-antral follicles in the ASC-CM group was significantly decreased in comparison to the Sham ( P <0.0001), and CTRL ( P =0.0002) groups. Moreover, the number of primary follicles in the ASC-CM group was significantly ( P =0.0059) less than that in the ASC group. Furthermore, the mean number of pre-antral follicles in the ASC and ASC-CM groups was less than the Sham ( P =0.0011 and P <0.0001, respectively), and CTRL ( P =0.0003 and P <0.0001, respectively) groups. In contrast, the mean number of antral follicles in the ASC-CM group was increased compared with the Sham and CTRL groups ( P =0.0121, P =0.0499). An important finding was a significant reduction of the number of atretic follicles in the ASC and ASC-CM rats compared to the Sham ( P =0.0031, P =0.0015) and CTRL ( P =0.0008, P =0.0004) groups. The number of corpus luteum in the ASC-CM group was significantly higher compared to the Sham ( P =0.0033), and CTRL ( P <0.0001) groups. In addition, the number of corpus luteum in the ASC group was significantly increased compared to the CTRL ( P =0.0173) group. Interestingly, ASC-CM treatment significantly decreased the number of ovarian cysts in comparison with the Sham ( P <0.0001), CTRL ( P =0.0006) and also ASC ( P =0.0041) groups (Table 3 ) (Fig 6 ).

An example of the images of the rats\u2019 estrus cycle is given in Fig. 7 . The estrus cycle disorders were appeared after letrozole administration for 21\u00a0days as almost all the PCOS rats were in metestrus and diestrus phases. Following 4\u00a0weeks of treatment, the data showed that compared with the ASC-CM and ASC groups, the Sham group displayed disrupted estrus cycles with longer time spent in the metestrus and diestrus phases ( P =\u20090.0015, P =\u20090.0048). Moreover, the proportion of proestrus stage in the ASC group significantly ( P =\u20090.0419) increased compared to the Sham group. Overall, after treatment with ASC and ASC-CM, there was an increase in the proportion of proestrus and estrus stages and a decrease in the proportion of diestrus /metestrus stages in the ASC and ASC-CM groups compared to the Sham group (Fig. 7 ).

Before the administration of glucose, a significant difference was found in the glucose level between the studied groups (Fig. 8 .A). Fasting blood sugar in the ASC group was significantly higher than the Sham ( P =\u20090.0037), CTRL ( P =\u20090.0044) and ASC-CM ( P =\u20090.0110) groups. Interestingly, thirty minutes after glucose loading, the ASC-CM group had a significantly ( P =\u20090.0154) lower glucose level than the Sham group. Furthermore, the ASC-CM group had a significantly ( P =\u20090.0138) lower AUC level compared to that of the Sham group (Fig. 8 .B).    The effects of ASC and ASC-CM on the expression level of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation regulators in the ovary of PCOS rat model  The fold change of the epigenetic modification enzymes DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC1, and HDAC2 in the right ovary was determined using qRT-PCR.

Overall, our data indicated that the highest expressions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 were found in the ASC-CM group rather than others (Fig. 10 .A, B).    The effects of ASC and ASC-CM on the expression level of estrogen receptors in the ovary of PCOS rat model  The impact of ASC and ASC-CM on the expression levels of key genes implicated the esteroidal actions; ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2 were examined in the right ovary. As shown in Fig. 11 , ASC-CM transplantation significantly increased the expression of ESR\u03b1 in the ASC-CM group compared to that of the sham ( P =\u20090.037), ASC and CTRL ( P =\u20090.05) (Fig. 11 .A). In parallel with this result, a significant increase in the mRNA expression of ESR\u03b2 was also evident in the ASC-CM group compared to the Sham ( P =\u20090.037) and CTRL ( P =\u20090.05) groups (Fig. 11 .B). In addition, a significant ( P =\u20090.037) overexpression of ESR\u03b2 was detected in the ASC group compared to the Sham group (Fig. 11 .B).

As shown in Fig. 12 .A and A\u1ffd, the ovary of rats in the ASC group displayed a significant increase in the protein expression level of 5mC in comparison to the CTRL group ( P =\u20090.0263). Notably, the protein level of 5hmC was significantly decreased in the ASC ( P =\u20090.0163) and ASC-CM ( P =\u20090.0258) groups versus the Sham group (Fig. 12 .B, B\u1ffd).

Previous studies showed that DNA hypomethylation occurs in various candidate genes implicated in PCOS pathogenesis [ 46 ]. Hence, we observed decreased expression of DNA methylation regulators including DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B in the ovarian tissue of untreated PCOS rats (sham and CTRL animals). Additionally, the PCOS ovaries showed a 5mC decrease in the genome methylation index and a 5hmC rise in the genome demethylation index. According to a prior research, PCOS women's GCs had 25% lower 5mC levels than the control group [ 47 ]. Therefore, a decline in the total content of DNA methylation and DNMT1 expression was observed in the oocytes of PCOS mouse model [ 48 ]. Sagvekar et al. [ 49 ] revealed that the downregulation of DNMT3A may contribute to DNA methylation changes in the GCs of PCOS women. Moreover, in line with DNA hypomethylation, we observed aberrant histone acetylation patterns in the untreated PCOS animals that are associated with epigenetic signature modification [ 50 ]. The PCOS mouse oocyte has been seen to have a reduction in HDAC1 expression, as well as a decrease in DNA and histone methylation. This phenomenon has been linked to elevated plasma androgen levels [ 48 ]. Thus, the PCOS animal model with prenatal testosterone exposure showed a significant decrease in HDAC3 gene expression in TCs of the ovary [ 15 ]. The changes in the PCOS ovaries might affect the expression level of important genes involved in PCOS pathogenesis. For example, reduced histone deacetylation [ 51 ] and DNA methylation [ 46 ] in PCOS patients can affect gene expression involved in androgen production, resulting in hyperandrogenism. DNA hypomethylation and reduced histone deacetylation can increase the expression of LH receptors in GCs and TCs [ 46 , 52 ], leading to higher P450C17a activity. P450C17a is a key enzyme in androgen synthesis, and an increase in its activity or expression promotes excessive androgen synthesis in the ovary [ 53 ]. Furthermore, since DNMT1 and HDAC1 are two critical genes for proper epigenetic modification and development, changes to these genes may impact the results of maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development in PCOS mice [ 54 ], ultimately leading to infertility. The expression of DNMTs and HDACs increased in the ovaries of treated PCOS rats, especially in those animals that received ASC-CM. Moreover, higher expression of 5mC and lower expression of 5hmC were observed in treated ovaries. It appears that microRNAs in exosome-derived MSCs may reprogram cells to repair damage and mediate protection by regulating the epigenetic process [ 55 ], so examining the exosomes in the CM may provide additional information. Furthermore, further research is necessary to validate the possibility that ASC-CM is linked to epigenetic modification-induced gene silencing in the promoter region of genes relevant to PCOS [ 56 , 57 ]. Totally, the upregulation of DNMTs, HDACs, along with higher levels of 5mC in the ASC and ASC-CM groups may be related to hypermethylation of some important genes that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PCOS which can control the side effects of PCOS [ 46 ].  Aberrant epigenetic status may alter the expression of genes involved in steroid synthesis, thereby affecting estrogen production, and ovarian function [ 12 , 58 , 59 ]. Estrogen may alter folliculogenesis by increasing the sensitivity of GCs to FSH and LH, promoting their proliferation in primary and pre-antral follicles, and modifying the production of progestins and cAMP [ 4 ]. This hormone mediates its effects via three types of receptors. The genomic pathway via ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2, and the non-genomic pathway via G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) [ 60 ]. Letrozole-induced PCOS rats were reported to downregulate ESR\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 mRNA expression, which could be involved in abnormal folliculogenesis in PCOS patients [ 4 , 61 , 62 ]. In alignment with the aforementioned results, our study revealed a significant decrease in the expression of estrogen receptors and serum estradiol levels in the untreated mice with PCOS. The inhibition of ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2 in the PCOS mouse model has resulted in ovarian cysts, hemorrhagic follicles, elevated androgen, and LH levels, as well as folliculogenesis and ovulatory failure [ 60 ]. However, after treatment of animals with ASC-CM, in our study, the expression of ESR\u03b1 and ESR\u03b2 genes and proteins increased, along with the serum estradiol level. These changes may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary\u2013gonadal (HPG) axis resulting in higher secretion of serum estradiol and improvement of ovarian function, leading to subsequent fertility in PCOS patients [ 6 ]. Thus, it was reported that ASC may suppress androgen production and stimulate steroidogenic gene expression in a PCOS rat model.[ 28 ].  Our results showed impaired folliculogenesis in the untreated PCOS rats, which was evident in a notable increase in the number of primary and pre-antral follicles, atretic, and cystic follicles as well as a decrease in the number of antral follicles and corpus luteum. These findings are consistent with prior reports in PCOS animal models [ 63 , 64 ]. These events were shown to be associated with an altered hormonal profile, such as ovarian androgen overproduction in PCOS animals leading to the stimulation of small follicles development and reduction of FSH secretion [ 65 , 66 ]. Tyndall et al. demonstrated that in immature rats, testosterone plays a pivotal role in GCs atresia, which leads to a reduction in the number of antral follicles [ 59 ]. However, ASC and ASC-CM transplantation improved folliculogenesis by maturation of greater numbers of small follicles without growing arrest, as well as improving the occurrence of ovulation by increasing the number of corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is the main source of progesterone secretion which is responsible for the regulation of reproductive cycles, as well as the preparation of uterus for conception [ 67 ]. As a result, an increase in corpus luteum numbers indicates that PCOS rats' ability to conceive may have improved. To help PCOS patients' ovaries heal, MSCs [ 63 ] and their exosome [ 68 ] may control follicular maturation, decrease GC apoptosis and promote their proliferation, as well as boost the production of growth factors [ 68 , 69 ]. MSC-CM has a notable capacity for suppression of androgen release and the regulation of steroidogenesis within in vitro and in vivo PCOS models [ 70 ]. Meanwhile, using ASCs and their CM have uncovered their potential to increase embryo development and oocyte maturation [ 31 ]. Secreted growth factor in CM could regulate signaling pathways associated with androgen synthesis via suppressing androgen production and downregulation of androgen-synthesizing gene expression [ 31 ]. Therefore, CMs enhance ovarian function through the modulation of epigenetic regulators [ 71 ]. Further investigations into these epigenetic mechanisms is necessary to fully understand and use these regenerative properties for clinical applications.  It has been shown that metabolic problems in PCOS humans and animal models are associated with ovarian function [ 72 ]. In line with earlier findings in PCOS patients [ 73 ] and animal models [ 74 ], our results revealed a substantial rise in the ovarian dimensions, body weight gain, longer diestrus phase, and increased glucose levels in PCOS rats. These changes can be attributed to letrozole-induced hormonal disorders and epigenetic modification [ 75 ]. Hormonal disturbances are in line with obesity [ 76 ], higher blood glucose levels and increased ovary dimensions [ 67 , 77 ], as well as irregular estrus cycle in the PCOS animal models [ 78 ]. Rajan et al. showed that the prolonged diestrus phase and increased body weight are related to increased testosterone concentration [ 79 ]. Furthermore, a significant improvement in the ovarian parameters, estrus cycle, and glucose levels was detected in the ASC-CM-treated rats, which is in agreement with the Jahan et al. reports [ 80 ]. Exosomes present in a conditioned media have the capacity to modulate sex hormone profiles [ 81 ], inflammation linked with obesity, and metabolic diseases [ 82 ]. Another possible mechanism involved in these positive effects of ASC-CM might be its ability to downregulate genes responsible for adiposity, and imbalance hormone profiling by modification of epigenetic regulators [ 56 , 81 ].  In conclusion, our study determined that changes in the 5mC and 5hmC protein levels along with alterations in the epigenetic regulators such as DNMTs and HDACs, as well as estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the reduction of serum estradiol levels are related to the PCOS pathogenesis which can be recovered via ASC and ASC-CM administration. Furthermore, by changing the expression of estrogen receptors in rats with PCOS, ASC-CM may restore steroid function and folliculogenesis. Additionally, it offers fresh proof of how DNMTs, HDACs, and ESR \u03b1 and \u03b2 are regulated during this process, which PCOS sufferers should research.
