    "abstract": "Introduction Validation assesses the acceptability, responsiveness, interpretability, and quality of any questionnaire in any specific population. This is done by correlation matrix evaluation of the proposed test tool with a previously well-validated assessment tool. The study objective is the dual-center assessment of the construct validity of the first health-related quality of life questionnaires for married and unmarried women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), i.e., PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, respectively. Materials and methods At two centers in Iraq, we enrolled 406 married women\u00a0and 362 unmarried women with PCOS to test for the construct validity of PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, respectively, from August 2019-August 2020 (after obtaining full results of reliability testing in our previous work). We used the comparable domains from the multiculturally validated questionnaire (World Health Organization Quality of Life [WHOQOL-BREF]) as a comparator to assess the construct validity of the domains of the final highly reliable questionnaire drafts of PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 which were obtained from our previous work. The enrolled women will respond to WHOQOL-BREF and either PCOSQoL-47 or PCOSQoL-42, according to their marital status. Pearson's parametric correlational coefficient compared the total scores of the matched domains in one of our questionnaires and WHOQOL-BREF at p\u22640.05. Values more than 0.3 denoted an important correlation between our test questionnaires and the well-validated WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. The inter-rater reliability between our questionnaires and the comparator was calculated by Cronbach's alpha level, inter-item, and intra-class correlations coefficients matrix. Results We obtained a good respondent-to-item ratio of approximately 9:1 for both questionnaires. We had a good response for the domains of our questionnaires and WHOQOL-BREF. The coping domain at PCOSQoL-42 showed the highest Pearson's coefficient value of (0.708), which indicates a strong and significant correlation between the two constructs at (p<0.001). Other domains of the PCOSQoL-42 showed moderate significant correlation coefficient values. The psychological and emotional status domain of PCOSQoL-47 showed a weak yet significant correlation with its corresponding domain of the WHOHRQOL-BREF. The other domains of the PCOSQoL-47 showed moderate significant correlation coefficient values >0.5. The PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47 showed high inter-rater reliability levels in measuring the requested construct or concept when we used Cronbach's alpha and inter-item correlation matrix assessment. Conclusion The individualized PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 for married and unmarried women with PCOS, respectively, represent the first reliable and valid HRQoL assessment tools for assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in those women with PCOS who use Arabic as a first or native language and address the sexual function as a separate domain.",
    "body": "Introduction  To measure whether the inferences and conclusions of any questionnaire or test score are suitable for what they were designed to measure, we used the term \"Validity\" [ 1 ]. Validation assesses the acceptability, responsiveness, interpretability, and quality of any questionnaire in any specific population [ 2 , 3 ]. There is a crossover between reliability and validity testing during the psychometric assessment of a questionnaire [ 1 ].  The construct validation is essential in testing the quality of questionnaires that deal with outcomes that are not directly observable, like health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Lack of construct validity between different measures of the questionnaire renders the questionnaire's results difficult to interpret, with the inability to draw inferences or associations from its responses\u00a0[ 4 ]. To test construct validity, the questionnaire of interest\u00a0and a preexisting well-validated test score or questionnaire are administered to the same group of individuals. Correlation matrix analysis is used to assess the different forms of association between different measures which have the same construct (concept) in a convergent or a divergent manner [ 5 ].  In our previous work [ 6 ], we discussed the psychometric analysis of the two newly developed HRQoL questionnaires for married and unmarried women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), i.e., PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, respectively. We described the item pool formation, content and face validity, applicability in a pilot study, and then test-retest reliability evaluation along with internal consistency. In this article, we will discuss the validation analysis through the construct validity testing of the two new questionnaires through a real-life study in premenopausal women with PCOS in two endocrinology centers in Iraq.    Materials and methods  This study had passed three phases to reach the final drafts of the questionnaire. The previous article [ 6 ] described the first two phases, in which all the psychometrics evaluation of the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 questionnaires for married and unmarried women with PCOS, respectively.  Phase 3: The second recruitment (August 2019-August 2020)  After the conclusion of the test-retest reliability analysis and internal consistency, we used the third draft to measure the HRQoL in the women with PCOS from the two groups (Tables 1 , 2 ), using the well-validated Arabic version of the WHOQOL-BREF [ 7 ] as a comparator for our questionnaires. A study group from two centers in Iraq performed the task of validity assessment for one year from August 2019-August 2020 (after obtaining full results of reliability testing in our previous work). These centers were Faiha Specialized Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolism Center (FDEMC), Basrah\u00a0and Thi-Qar Specialized Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolism Center (TDEMC), Thi-Qar.

E6  Felt a lack of satisfaction with your current role as a wife?      The same previous enrollment criteria were applied during this recruitment phase, with the ethical consent forms signed [ 6 ]. Each woman received two questionnaires forums simultaneously, i.e., (PCOSQoL-47 or PCOSQoL-42, with the WHOQOL-BREF). All women received a full description of the questionnaire items by their interviewing endocrinologist.  WHOQOL-BREF  The 26-item\u00a0WHOQOL-BREF is a cross-culturally validated, applicable generic questionnaire for assessing general healthy well-being [ 7 ]. It is not specific for assessing HRQoL in PCOS because of the heterogenic nature of the syndrome. The WHOQOL-BREF was used as a baseline or a comparator instrument to validate the questionnaires in different communities [ 8 - 11 ].  The WHOQOL-BREF has four domains of quality of life (QoL) - physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental - with the first two questions on overall QoL and general health. The questions reflected the respondent\u2019s feelings in the last two weeks. Each question is scored on a five-point Likert scale, 1 indicates maximum HRQoL impairment, and 5 indicates the least impairment [ 9 , 12 ].  Construct validity  We used the construct validity testing to evaluate the ability of the present questionnaires to measure a construct (concepts) [ 13 ], by comparing the equivalent domains in the two questionnaires, i.e., PCOSQoL-47 or PCOSQoL-42, with the WHOQOL-BREF. The analysis was done using Pearson\u2019s correlational analysis. A Likert scale measured the present questionnaire and the WHOQOL-BREF from 1 to 5. So, there was no need to create a specific syntax for the scores.  The first step in construct validity was to determine the corresponding similar domains that measure similar constructs and presumed statistically coherent outcomes from the two questionnaires, i.e., PCOSQoL-47 or PCOSQoL-42, and the WHOQOL-BREF (Table 3 ).   Table 3   The corresponding similar domains and items in the present questionnaires with WHOQOL-BREF.  a The psychological domain questions are items (3, 4, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 18), the physical health domain questions are items (5, 6, 7, 11, 19, and 26), and the social relationships domain questions are items (20, 21, and 22).

The questionnaires' data were captured directly on an already prepared IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) format by the interviewer. Then it was checked and compared by two other research members for consistency and accuracy of the data.  Pearson's correlational coefficient was used to compare the total score of the matched domains in our questionnaire and the WHOQOL-BREF and measured the significance level at a two-tailed significance of \u22640.05. The level of this coefficient determined the correlation between the two constructs where (0 - 0.19) very weak, (0.20 - 0.39) weak, (0.40 - 0.59) moderate, (0.60 - 0.79) strong, and (0.80 - 1.00) very strong. The inter-rater reliability between our questionnaires and the comparator was calculated by Cronbach's alpha level, inter-item, and intra-class correlations (ICC) coefficients matrix.  Management of Data  To achieve this goal, we enrolled all the women with PCOS from both groups who attended these two endocrine centers with a diagnosis of PCOS from August 2019 to August 2020, who fulfilled the enrollment criteria of the study, and consented for recruitment in the study [ 6 ].  There were 362 unmarried women with PCOS who responded to the PCOSQoL-42 and WHOQOL-BREF. There were 406 married women who responded to the PCOSQoL-47 and WHOQOL-BREF. All the responses were checked, registered, and calculated initially by two research members independently. The questionnaire paper and electronic forms for each woman from either group were numbered by the first author, where all other authors were blinded to, to achieve the responses' maximal anonymity.  The timeline, which was proposed initially by the authors to be a year period for construct validation analysis, determined the final sample size, the total number of 768 out of 913 women with PCOS (84.1%) who attended the two centers for management at a year period from August 2019 to August 2020. We excluded 145\u00a0women with PCOS from the study because they did not fulfill the enrollment criteria.  All the paper forums were sorted and stored according to registration numbers set by the first author, where they were ready to be retrieved on request from any respondent. All enrolled women were provided with a copy of their responses for their own to ensure transparency in dealing with their data. All women were told they would be free to withhold their consent at any time during the study till the time of final publication, and this would not affect by any way the level of medical care provided for them. No woman at all withheld her consent. There was no monetary incentive for the participants.  Ethical approval  All the study phases were in accordance with FDEMC ethical committee standards, from whom ethical approval was obtained for the study. The approval number was E43/3/2018. All enrolled women signed informed consent in Arabic before participating in the study.    Results  The construct validation of the third draft  To start validation analysis, we combined our already measured PCOSQoL questionnaires with the corresponding similar domains in the Arabic version of the WHOQOL-BREF as a comparator, which was shown in Tables 1 , 2 , 3 . We implemented a second recruitment study to include 362 unmarried and 406 married women with PCOS to respond to PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47, respectively, along with the WHOQOL-BREF at the same time. The sample size had a respondent-to-item ratio of approximately 9:1.  The general characteristics of both cohorts and their initial responses are described in Tables 4 , 5 .

The final versions of PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47 in Arabic are present as an appendix in our previous work [ 6 ].    Discussion  Both five-domains PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47 showed similar construct validity to that of the six-domain\u00a0PCOSQ-50 when measuring the ICC values [ 14 ]. However, we used the WHOQOL-BREF as a comparator [ 7 ], while they used Short-Form 36 (SF-36) [ 13 ]. Both WHOQOL-BREF and SF-36 are reliable and internationally validated to measure the QoL in general [ 7 , 15 ]. This might change the corresponding domains and items between our scales with WHOQOL-BREF and that of PCOSQ-50 with the SF-36.  All domains in our scales showed significant correlations with the corresponding domains of WHOQOL-BREF. Four domains from each scale showed a moderately\u00a0significant correlation; the coping domain of PCOSQoL-42 showed a strong or high correlation, and the psychological and emotional status domain\u00a0of PCOSQoL-47 showed a weak correlation, yet highly significant at a two-tailed significance level <0.001 (Table 6 ).  The internal consistency of both questionnaires measured by the Cronbach's alpha in (Table 7 ) showed that only the coping domain of PCOSQoL-42 had exceeded the 0.7. Other domains had an alpha value ranging from (0.423 - 0.697), which could be considered a minor limitation. Yet, other parameters like the inter-item correlation mean and ICC were acceptable and highly significant. The WHOQOL-BREF had insufficient sensitivity in measuring the impact of PCOS symptoms because of the heterogeneity of the PCOS symptomatology [ 12 ]. Again this benefited our study that these domains showed a high validity for those domains that did not achieve the requested alpha value of 0.7. This would necessitate the comparison with other more sensitive scales in the subsequent multicenter nationwide studies to have better validity.  The sample size for the construct validity evaluation could be a strength and limitation at the same time. Although there were no absolute rules for the sample size needed to validate a questionnaire [ 16 ], we aimed for a sample size of 500 respondents for each questionnaire to meet the (very good sample size) proposed by Comrey et al. [ 17 ] to achieve an item to a respondent ratio more than 10:1. But we achieved only a ratio of 8.6:1, which was acceptable [ 16 ]. This was caused by the 35% drop-down of the number of attendees to the endocrine centers due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, lockdown, and social distancing. The referral bias might be a limitation because the venue of the study represents two tertiary endocrine centers. We used a simple Arabic language with minimal use of ambiguous and medical terms to make the items more acceptable for women from both groups. We also avoided the words which might have different meanings and were confined to the original one-meaning words.    Conclusions  The individualized PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 for married and married and unmarried women with PCOS represent the first reliable and valid HRQoL assessment tools for assessing the HRQoL in those women with PCOS who use Arabic as a first or native language,  Validation of PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 in other local languages like Kurdish will be undertaken following this study. Validation in local languages should be undertaken to cover a more diverse population.  The questionnaire\u2019s longitudinal and discriminant validity also needs to be tested during treatment trials to test its sensitivity to the effect of interventions and change in our local population. This will enable us to use the questionnaire to measure the treatment effect on HRQoL\u00a0and to compare the effects on HRQoL from different interventions.",
