Changes in the morphology of the ovarian stroma are cardinal features of PCOS. The ovary is more fibrous and has more tunica and cortical and subcortical stroma.

    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex reproductive and metabolic disorder with multiple clinical symptoms including psychological consequences ( Teede et al. , 2010 ). The syndrome affects around 1 in 10 women, presenting with symptoms associated with excess androgen, reproductive dysfunction and metabolic complications such as insulin resistance, gestational diabetes, central adiposity, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidaemia and cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases among others ( Norman et al. , 2007 ; March et al. , 2010 ; Azziz et al. , 2016 ; Rodgers et al. , 2019 ; Stepto et al. , 2019 ; Berni et al. , 2021 ).  The aetiology of PCOS is not well established. However, a possible foetal predisposition has been observed in numerous studies over the past decades. For example, babies born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which causes elevated androgen exposure in foetal life, develop some of the features of PCOS in adulthood ( Barnes et al. , 1994 ). Androgen treatment of pregnant animals also produces a phenotype of PCOS features in the offspring ( Abbott et al. , 2006 ; Walters, 2016 ; Tata et al. , 2018 ; Risal et al. , 2019 ; Aflatounian et al. , 2020 ; Stener-Victorin et al. , 2020 ). More so, a low ponderal index (kg/m 3 ) of children at birth has also been associated with the risk of all three cardinal PCOS symptoms (menstrual dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries) in later life ( Davies et al. , 2012 ).  PCOS also has a genetic predisposition with large genome-wide association studies and familial microsatellite linkage studies having identified a number of loci associated with PCOS ( Legro et al. , 1998 ; Urbanek, 2007 ; Chen et al. , 2011 ; Goodarzi et al. , 2012 ; Shi et al. , 2012 ; Kosova and Urbanek, 2013 ; Louwers et al. , 2013 ). There are about 25 genes in or near these loci. We recently identified that PCOS candidate genes in these loci were not differentially expressed in adult human PCOS ovaries ( Liu et al. , 2020 ) but were dynamically expressed in developing human and bovine foetal ovaries ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ; Liu et al. , 2020 ). We concluded that expression of PCOS candidate genes in foetal ovaries if perturbed or dysregulated may underpin development of PCOS ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ; Liu et al. , 2020 ).  There are some other unique features of PCOS. PCOS ovaries not only have many antral follicles but they have an expanded and very fibrous stroma ( Stein and Leventhal, 1935 ; Hughesdon, 1982 ). During foetal development, the ovarian stroma is initially derived from stroma that penetrates into the ovarian primordium from the mesonephros during the first trimester ( Hummitzsch et al. , 2013 , 2015 , 2018 ). It expands the most during early gestation due to high levels of stromal cell replication ( Hartanti et al. , 2019 ; Hummitzsch et al. , 2019 ). The causes or consequences of expanded fibrous stroma in PCOS ovaries are still unknown. It is possible that either the stroma is altered in a peculiar way during development of the ovary to enable it to expand and become fibrous in later life or that the adult PCOS ovaries have just became fibrotic due to fibrosis. Fibrosis is usually a wound healing event where death of specialized cells occurs and replaced by stroma and collagen.  Growth of stroma in many organs is usually driven by the growth factor transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) ( Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 ). In adult tissues TGF\u03b2 stimulates replication and production and deposition of collagen in stroma, particularly in fibrotic tissues ( Verrecchia and Mauviel, 2004 ). In stroma, TGF\u03b2 activity is regulated by the extracellular matrix fibrillins ( Kielty et al. , 2002 ). Fibrillins achieve this by binding the latent TGF\u03b2 binding proteins (LTBPs). There are three fibrillin genes, four LTBPs, three TGF\u03b2s and three TGF\u03b2 receptors. We previously found that TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules (TGF\u03b2s, LTBPs, fibrillins and TGF\u03b2 receptors) are expressed in foetal ovaries ( Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 , 2019 ). Their levels of expression were either constant ( TGFB1 , TGFBR1 ), increasing ( TGFB2 , TGFB3 , TGFBR2 , TGFBR3 , LTBP1 , LTBP2 , LTBP3 , LTBP4 ) or decreasing ( FBN2 , FBN3 ) across gestation ( Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 , 2019 ). We also showed that TGF\u03b2 inhibited expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) and 3 PCOS candidate genes ( INSR , C8H9orf3 and RAD50 ) and stimulated expression of TGFB1I1 (transforming growth factor beta 1-induced transcript 1) in cultured foetal ovarian stroma cells ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ). This suggests that TGF\u03b2 signalling is dynamic during foetal ovarian development and could be an important part of the aetiology of PCOS, providing a link between the genetic basis and foetal predisposition to PCOS.  Circulating levels of TGF\u03b22 were found to be correlated with androgen levels in women ( Raja-Khan et al. , 2014 ) and skeletal muscles in adult women with PCOS have higher expression levels of genes controlled by TGF\u03b2 and they produce more collagens ( Stepto et al. , 2020 ). In adipose tissue of PCOS women, TGF\u03b21 was identified as the master upstream regulator ( Dumesic et al. , 2019 ). In order to further our knowledge of TGF\u03b2 and foetal ovary development, we examined the regulation of eight additional PCOS candidate genes and the expression of TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules during foetal ovary development using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis.    Materials and methods   Ethical approval for the study  Ethical approval was not required for this study, as foetuses and foetal ovaries were scavenged from animals being processed for human consumption and were not owned by the authors or their institutions. As such the University of Adelaide\u2019s Animal Ethics Committee only requires notification of this.    Collection of bovine foetal ovaries  For RNA-seq, foetal ovarian pairs across gestation (62\u2013276\u2009days, n\u2009=\u200919) were collected from pregnant Bos taurus cows at the abattoir of Midfield Meat International, Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia and were immediately frozen on dry ice on site and later stored in the laboratory at \u221280\u00b0C.  For TGF\u03b21 treatment, foetuses from pregnant B.  taurus cows were collected at local abattoirs (Thomas Foods International, Murray Bridge, SA, Australia and Strath Meats, Strathalbyn, SA, Australia) and transported on ice in Hank\u2019s balanced-salt solution (HBSS) with calcium and magnesium (HBSS +/+ ) to the laboratory. The gestational ages of all foetuses were estimated from the crown-rump length (CRL) ( Russe, 1983 ). Foetuses with a CRL <8\u2009cm underwent sex determination as previously reported by Hummitzsch et al. (2013) .    RNA extraction and RNA-seq  Using the Mo Bio Powerlyser 24 (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1\u2009ml Trizol \u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), whole foetal bovine ovaries were homogenized and RNA extracted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNase I (Promega/Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Tullamarine, VIC, Australia) was used to treat all samples. The RNA concentration and quality were then determined using the Experion\u2122 RNA StdSens Analysis kit and the Experion\u2122 Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Pty., Ltd., Gladesville, NSW, Australia). Of total RNA, 500\u2009ng/50\u2009\u00b5l per well (96-well plate) of each sample was used for RNA-seq.  RNA-seq based transcriptome profiling was performed at the SAHMRI Genomics Facility (SAHMRI, Adelaide, SA, Australia). Briefly, single-end poly A-selection mRNA libraries (\u223c35 M reads per sample) were created using the Nugen Universal Plus mRNA-Seq library kit from Tecan (Mannedorf, Switzerland) and sequenced with an Illumina Nextseq 500 using single read 75\u2009bp (v2.0) sequencing chemistry (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Two sequencing runs, with 10 samples per run, were performed and a sample (15/R43t, 135\u2009days gestational age) was used as internal control in both runs.    RNA-seq data analysis using Partek flow  The raw data containing FASTQ files were uploaded to Partek Flow \u00ae Software, version 8.0 (Partek Incorporated, St. Louis, MO, USA). All samples underwent a pre-alignment quality assessment and showed Phred Quality Scores larger than 30. The reads were aligned and annotated to the bovine genome ARS-UCD1.2 (bosTau9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_002263795.1/ ) using STAR 2.7.3a aligner (>97% alignment rate for all samples) and Partek E/M, respectively. The FASTQ files, normalised data and experimental information have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) ( Barrett et al. , 2009 ), accessible by accession number GSE178450 . The expression of TGF\u03b2s, LTBPs, fibrillins and TGF\u03b2 receptors were analysed using Partek Flow \u00ae Software (version 8.0). Scatter plots showing the expression patterns for fibrillins, LTBPs, TGF\u03b2s and TGF\u03b2 receptors across gestation were generated using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Pearson\u2019s correlation of the genes with gestational age as well as with each other were further analysed.    Treatment of bovine foetal fibroblasts with TGF\u03b21  Foetal fibroblasts (160\u2013198\u2009days, n\u2009=\u20096) were cultured and treated with 5\u2009ng/ml or 20\u2009ng/ml TGF\u03b21 (R&D Systems) as previously described by Bastian et al. (2016) . Briefly, bovine foetal fibroblasts were seeded at 30\u00a0000 cells/well in 24-well plates in DMEM/F12 medium containing 5% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 100\u2009IU/ml penicillin, 0.01% streptomycin sulfate (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 15140122) and 0.1% fungizone at 38.5\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . At 60\u201370% confluency, cells were treated with 5\u2009ng/ml or 20\u2009ng/ml of TGF\u03b21 for 18\u2009h in DMEM/F12 medium containing 1% foetal calf serum and then harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for analysis.    RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR  Bovine foetal fibroblasts were homogenized in 1\u2009ml Trizol \u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using the Mo Bio Powerlyser 24 (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNA extracted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions as reported previously ( Bastian et al. , 2016 ). Complementary DNA was then synthesized from 200\u2009ng of DNase-treated RNA using random hexamers (Sigma, Adelaide, SA, Australia) and 200 U Superscript Reverse Transcriptase III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ). Based on available RNA sequences in NCBI, PCR primers for eight newly discovered PCOS candidate genes ( ERBB3 , MAPRE1 , FDFT1 , NEIL2 , ARL14EP , PLGRKT , IRF1 and ZBTB16 ) were designed to span introns using Primer3 plus and Net primer software (PREMIER Biosoft Palo Alto, CA, USA) and primers are listed in Table\u00a0I . Primer combinations were tested as previously described ( Hummitzsch et al. , 2013 ; Liu et al. , 2020 ). The amplification conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, then 60\u00b0C for 60\u2009s for 40 cycles using Rotor Gene 6000 cycler (Q series, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Ct values were determined using Rotor Gene 6000 software at a threshold of 0.05 normalized fluorescent unit. Gene expression values were determined using 2 \u2212\u0394Ct method and ribosomal protein L32 ( RPL32 ) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A ( PPIA ) were used as housekeeping genes. The fold change of gene expression in foetal fibroblasts treated with the two different concentrations of TGF\u03b21 were presented as 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct data with the same housekeeping genes in 2 \u2212\u0394Ct method.

Scatter plots and columns were made using GraphPad Prism version 8.00 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). One-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post  hoc tests were conducted to compare the difference between the control and the TGF\u03b21 treatments of foetal fibroblasts.     Results   Expression of TGF\u03b2s, LTBPs, fibrillins, TGF\u03b2 receptors other molecules involved in TGF\u03b2 signalling  The expression of the TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules in foetal ovaries showed dynamic differences across gestation. The expression levels of most TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules significantly correlated with gestational age either positively ( LTBP1 , LTBP2 , LTBP3 , LTBP4 , FBN1 , TGFB2 , TGFB3 , TGFBR2 , TGFBR3 and TGFB1I1 ) or negatively ( FBN3 , TGFBR3L , TGFBI and TGFB1 ), while few showed no significant correlation with gestational age ( TGFBRAP1 , TGFBR1 and FBN2 ). Also, almost all the TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules, with the major exception being TGFBRAP1 , correlated either positively or negatively with each other ( Table\u00a0II ), consistent with there being a regulated network.   Table II   Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients (R) between TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules mRNA expression levels and gestational age (62\u2013276\u2009days, n\u2009=\u200919) in bovine foetal ovaries.              Positive and negative correlations are marked in pink and blue, respectively. The colour intensity corresponds with the strength of the correlation. P -values: a <0.05; b <0.01; c <0.001; d <0.0001.     The expression of all four LTBP genes increased across gestation ( Fig.\u00a01D\u2013G ). LTBP3 and LTBP4 expression levels plateaued at the second half of gestation or at the start of the third trimester, respectively. FBN1 expression ( Fig.\u00a01A ) increased across gestation and FBN3 decreased significantly across gestation ( Fig.\u00a01C ). FBN2 also increased slightly across gestation ( Fig.\u00a01B ).

Notably, TGFB1 expression decreased across gestation until about the end of the second trimester and gradually increased during the third semester. The expression patterns of TGFB2 and TGFB3 increased across gestation ( Fig.\u00a02B and C ). Although TGFB3 expression increased across gestation, the expression levels were variable in the third trimester ( Fig.\u00a02C ). The levels of TGFBR1 expression increased gradually until about the end of the second semester and decreased during the third semester. TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 expression both increased across gestation without any decline in the third trimester ( Fig.\u00a02E and F ).   Figure 2.

While TGFBR3L and TGFBI expression decreased across gestation ( Fig.\u00a03B and C ), expression of TGFB1I1 increased across gestation ( Fig.\u00a03D ). Expression of TGFBRAP1 was relatively constant across gestation ( Fig\u00a03A ).   Figure 3.

Regulation of PCOS candidate genes in foetal fibroblast  We also examined the effects of TGF\u03b21 on the PCOS genes in cultured foetal fibroblasts. Treatment with TGF\u03b21 had an effect on half of the eight genes ( ERBB3 , MAPRE1 , FDFT1 , NEIL2 , ARL14EP , PLGRKT , IRF1 and ZBTB16 ) studied. Significantly, TGF\u03b21 (20\u2009ng/ml) decreased the expression of ERBB3 ( Fig.\u00a04A ), NEIL2 , IRF1 and ZBTB16 ( Fig.\u00a04D, G and H ), with the latter three also decreased by treatment with 5\u2009ng/ml TGF\u03b21.

Fold changes of gene expression to the control groups are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (normalized to PPIA and RPL32 ).

Discussion  In this study, we explored the expression of TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules (TGF\u03b2s, LTBPs, fibrillins and TGF\u03b2 receptors and other associated proteins) in bovine foetal ovaries across gestation using RNA-seq analysis. We also analysed the effects of TGF\u03b21 in regulating expression of PCOS candidate genes in cultured bovine foetal ovarian fibroblasts. Our results indicate that TGF\u03b2 signalling pathways operating in the foetal ovary should be considered contenders for involvement in at least some aspects of the aetiology of PCOS, especially the development of polycystic ovaries.  The current theories on the aetiology of PCOS strongly implicate androgens or androgen signalling during foetal development ( Abbott et al. , 2006 ; Walters, 2016 ; Tata et al. , 2018 ; Risal et al. , 2019 ; Aflatounian et al. , 2020 ; Stener-Victorin et al. , 2020 ) and in particular androgen signalling in the brain ( Cox et al. , 2020 ). The question has remained what would stimulate or initiate enhanced androgen signalling in vivo . As far as we are aware, there are no environmental androgens, if anything, many are anti-androgens. Recently, it has been suggested that AMH, which is elevated in PCOS women during pregnancy by about 2-fold, could elevate the levels of androgens and hence initiate the PCOS phenotype in their offspring ( Tata et al. , 2018 ). However, AMH and androgens do not alter expression of any of the PCOS candidate genes in cultured foetal fibroblasts ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ; Liu et al. , unpublished results), but in contrast, TGF\u03b21 alters the expression of 7 out of 25 PCOS candidate genes as shown previously ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ) and in this study. Importantly, TGF\u03b2 also regulates the expression of AR and one of its cofactors, TGF\u03b21I1 ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ). Members of the TGF\u03b2 signalling pathways are operative before and when the AR is expressed in the foetal ovary. The concept that TGF\u03b2 is involved in PCOS not only links the foetal and genetic predispositions to PCOS but it specifically links to the ovarian morphology of PCOS ( Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 ). In adult tissues in general, TGF\u03b2 stimulates stromal fibroblast replication and collagen deposition but in foetal tissues, which do not scar in wound healing, it has the opposite effect ( Rolfe et al. , 2007 ; Rolfe and Grobbelaar, 2012 ). This has also been demonstrated in the foetal ovarian fibroblasts where TGF\u03b2 inhibited COL1A1 and COL3A1 expression (Liu et al. , unpublished results). TGF\u03b2 also inhibited expression of AR . Thus, we speculate that inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signalling in the foetal ovary is likely to increase androgen sensitivity and stromal activity and thus this mechanism could be part of the aetiology of PCOS. It is also possible that such mechanisms act in other organs affected by PCOS such as skeletal muscle where in PCOS women expression levels of genes controlled by TGF\u03b2 are elevated, including collagens ( Stepto et al. , 2020 ).  In this study, we found that most of TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules significantly correlated negatively or positively with gestational age similar to our previous studies of bovine foetal ovaries using qRT-PCR ( Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 , 2019 ; Hartanti et al. , 2019 ). The expression of TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules in foetal and adult ovaries have also been studied in various species now including human, goat, sheep, pig and cattle ( Chegini and Flanders, 1992 ; Nilsson et al. , 2003 ; Sriperumbudur et al. , 2010 ; Hatzirodos et al. , 2011 , 2019 ; Rodrigues et al. , 2014 ; Hartanti et al. , 2019 ). Stromal growth factors play significant roles in embryonic gonadal development via extracellular matrix contributing significantly to cell growth, differentiation and development ( Ingman and Robertson, 2002 ; Memon et al. , 2008 ). TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules are also known to contribute significantly to ovarian function in later life including follicle development ( Oliver, 2016 ), granulosa proliferation ( Dodson and Schomberg, 1987 ), differentiation of thecal-interstitial cells ( Magoffin et al. , 1989 ) and antral follicle growth and follicle selection ( Knight and Glister, 2006 ), among others.  The relationship between TGF\u03b2 and androgen signalling in general is complex as their regulation could be negative or positive depending on the various signals or environmental conditions ( Qi et al. , 2008 ). Although TGF\u03b2 is positively regulated by androgen in certain cancer cell lines ( Rosas et al. , 2021 ), TGF\u03b2 is known to inhibit androgen through interaction with Smad3 in different cells including thecal-interstitial cells, prostate and prostate epithelial cells ( Kyprianou and Isaacs, 1988 , 1989 ; Magoffin et al. , 1989 ; Chipuk et al. , 2002 ). Furthermore, studies focused on TGF\u03b21 deficiency in reproduction have received significant attention and have been reviewed in detail by Ingman and Robertson (2009) . TGF\u03b21 is a ligand of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily, which is essential in development and cell differentiation (Wu and Hill, 2009; Zinski et al. , 2018 ). In adult bovine ovaries, TGF\u03b21 protein was detected in the granulosa cells of early pre-antral and early antral follicles (1\u20132\u2009cm) but was not observed after these stages ( Nilsson et al. , 2003 ). TGFB1 null mice have perturbed hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis function, which results in reduction in LH levels, further resulting in reduced serum androstenedione and testosterone production in males and oestrous cycle abnormalities in female mice ( Ingman et al. , 2006 ; Ingman and Robertson, 2007 ). Notably, oocyte developmental incompetence due to a TGF\u03b21 deficient follicular environment has also been associated with the early embryo arrest in these mice ( Ingman et al. , 2006 ; Ingman and Robertson, 2009 ) . These observations further affirm the significance of TGF\u03b21 in ovarian functions and their possible association with PCOS.  Dysregulation of TGF\u03b2 signalling during foetal ovary development could involve a number of different members of the pathways and could vary across gestation. FBN3 , TGFBR3L , TGFBI and TGFB1 were highly expressed at the early stages of foetal ovary development and their levels significantly dropped as the ovary developed. It is during the early stages of ovarian development that stroma expansion predominantly occurs ( Hartanti et al. , 2019 ). Thus, these genes are mostly expressed when the stroma of the mesonephros, containing fibroblasts, fibres and capillaries, penetrates into the gonadal ridge resulting in the formation of the ovigerous cords containing the gonadal ridge epithelial like (GREL) cells and oogonia. TGFBR3L was recently shown to bind inhibin B and null mice were found to have elevated levels of FSH, antral follicles and corpora lutea ( Br\u00fbl\u00e9 et al. , 2021 ). TGFBI , previously named Beta Ig-H3 ( \u03b2ig-H3 ), has been studied over the past two decades. TGFBI is a secreted extracellular matrix protein, expressed in collagen-rich tissues in response to TGF\u03b2. TGFBI is known to play significant roles in numerous physiological processes such as morphogenesis, extracellular matrix interactions, cell adhesion/migration and angiogenesis required for development; however, its functional contribution is poorly understood ( Ferguson et al. , 2003 ; Thapa et al. , 2007 ). TGFBI polymorphisms have also been associated with levels of insulin and BMI ( Park et al. , 2005 ) and its roles in physiological and pathological conditions including diabetes and tumourigenesis have been reviewed ( Ween et al. , 2012 ). Recent studies have also shown that TGFBI regulates adipose angiogenesis and stimulates the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells ( Lee et al. , 2021 ).  During the later stages of ovary development, the expression of TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules such as TGFB2 , TGFB3 , LTBP1 , LTBP2 , LTBP3 , LTBP4 , FBN1 , TGFBR2 , TGFBR3 and TGFB1I1 increases. During this stage of ovary development, folliculogenesis and ovarian steroidogenesis occur and stroma beneath the surface epithelial basal lamina develops into the tunica albuginea in human and bovine ovaries ( Hummitzsch et al. , 2013 , 2019 ; Heeren et al. , 2015 ). Activation of some primordial follicles occurs leading to their development into primary and preantral follicles. LTBPs, whose genes are expressed the most during the third trimester, are well known for their ability to bind to FBN1 and FBN2 to modulate TGF\u03b2 availability. They also act as structural components of extracellular matrix ( Todorovic et al. , 2005 ) . Notably in adult bovine ovaries, TGF\u03b22 and TGF\u03b23 levels increase as follicles develop into large antral stage, while TGF\u03b21 levels decrease during this stage ( Nilsson et al. , 2003 ). TGFB1 and TGFBR3 were downregulated in cumulus cells isolated from matured metaphase II oocytes of PCOS women ( Haouzi et al. , 2012 ). TGFBR1 and TGFBR3 expression were dysregulated in ovaries of cows with cystic ovarian disease ( Matiller et al. , 2019 ). It is unclear if these dysregulations are of foetal origin given that TGFBR1 is expressed more in foetal fibroblasts than adult fibroblasts of the ovary (Liu et al. , unpublished results).   TGFB1I1 , also known as hic-5, is a transcription factor and a co-activator of the AR ( Fujimoto et al. , 1999 ). It regulates proliferation and apoptosis via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway ( Sha et al. , 2020 ) and suppresses cell migration and invasion by inhibition of the TGF\u03b2 pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( Ruan et al. , 2020 ). Also, expression of TGFB1I1 is increased in the presence of TGF\u03b21 ( Hartanti et al. , 2020 ). TGFB1I1 was also among the TGF\u03b2 signalling molecules downregulated in cumulus cells isolated from matured metaphase II oocytes of PCOS women ( Haouzi et al. , 2012 ).  In conclusion, we consider the following data support the hypothesis that altered TGF\u03b2 signalling could be involved in the foetal predisposition to PCOS or at least in the development of polycystic ovaries: (i) TGF\u03b2 is linked to the development of fibrous stroma, which is a hallmark of polycystic ovaries, (ii) in foetal ovarian fibroblasts TGF\u03b21 can regulate seven genes genetically associated with PCOS, (iii) in foetal ovarian fibroblasts TGF\u03b21 can alter the expression of AR and an AR cofactor and androgen signalling has been shown to be very likely involved in the foetal development of an adult PCOS phenotype, (iv) in foetal ovarian fibroblasts TGF\u03b21 can regulate expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 thus regulating collagen synthesis and (v) many of the components of TGF\u03b2 signalling are dynamically expressed in foetal ovaries across gestation as are the PCOS candidate genes. The implications of these findings for the function of other organ systems associated with PCOS, like the skeletal muscle, should also be explored.
