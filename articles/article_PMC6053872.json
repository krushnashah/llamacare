The PCOSQOL scale represents\naspects of quality of life important to women with PCOS and may be more\nsensitive for use in the clinical and research settings.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or polycystic ovarian syndrome, is the most common\nendocrine disorder amongst women of reproductive age ( Franks, 1995 ) affecting approximately\n6.5\u2009per cent of women ( Asuncion\net al., 2000 ; Azziz et\nal., 2004 ). It is the most prevalent cause of anovulatory infertility\n( Gorry et al., 2006 ).\nOther symptoms include hirsutism (the growth of excess hair), insulin resistance,\nobesity ( Goudas and Dumesic,\n1997 ), acne ( Coffey et\nal., 2006 ) and hair loss ( Elsenbruch et al., 2003 ). Women with PCOS\nare also more likely to experience depression and anxiety ( Himelein and Thatcher, 2006 ) at increased\nlevels compared to women without PCOS ( Deeks et al., 2011 ).  PCOS negatively impacts quality of life (QoL) ( Brady et al., 2009 ; Coffey and Mason, 2003 ). Yet McCook et al. (2005) suggest that the psychological implications of PCOS are underestimated and have been\nlargely ignored. While PCOS has a negative impact on QoL, the manifestation of this\nimpact varies across the globe. In Turkish women with PCOS, A\u00e7maz et al. (2013) found that an irregular\nmenstrual cycle and hirsutism had the largest impact on QoL. In Iran, menstrual\nirregularities and infertility were the most common QoL concerns ( Bazarganipour et al., 2013 )\nfollowed by hirsutism, weight, emotion concerns and acne. For Brazilian women with\nPCOS, body weight and infertility had the largest negative impact on QoL ( Benetti-Pinto et al., 2015 ).\nThis research demonstrates the negative impact of PCOS on QoL, how this condition\nimpacts QoL and how the condition manifests differently across the globe. A\ndisease-specific scale, therefore, which measures QoL concerns as defined by women\nwith PCOS in the United Kingdom is needed to reflect those domains of QoL which are\nimportant to this population.  At present, the PCOSQ, a 26-item questionnaire, developed in the United States ( Cronin et al., 1998 ) is the\nmost popular QoL measure used in research involving women with PCOS. McGee (2004) suggests that\ndisease-specific measures should focus on the most important aspects of QoL for\nindividuals with the condition. However, as the PCOSQ pertains mostly to physical\nsymptoms, it overlooks many of the aspects of QoL raised by women with PCOS in the\nqualitative literature ( Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002 ; Williams et al., 2014 , 2015 ). Indeed, the 2012\nAmsterdam ESHRE/ASRM workshop argued that QoL research in women with PCOS has been\nhampered by the existence of only one validated disease-specific questionnaire. More\nrecently, Barry et al.\n(2017) suggested that a more sensitive measure of QoL for women with PCOS\nmay be needed for QoL research in this condition. This suggests that research in the\narea of PCOS could benefit from the availability of a more sensitive PCOS QoL\nscale.  Recent qualitative literature also supports the notion that the PCOSQ does not\nreflect QoL, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (WHOQOL Group, 1994)\nand women with the condition ( Snyder, 2006 ; Williams et al., 2014 , 2015 ). The WHOQOL Group (1994) proposes that there\nare six domains of QoL: physical health, psychological health, level of\nindependence, social relationships, and environment and\nspirituality/religion/personal beliefs. The PCOSQ includes five subscales: emotions,\nbody hair, infertility, weight and menstrual problems; as four of these subscales\nfocus on physical aspects of the condition, it suggests that the PCOSQ is concerned\nmore with the physical impact of PCOS than psychological, social or environmental\naspects ( The WHOQOL Group,\n1994 ). Indeed, Malik-Aslam et al. (2010) suggest that QoL measures should represent\nthose areas of importance to women with the condition. We contend that a QoL measure\nwhich represents those domains of QoL that women with the condition consider\nimportant, and which are reflective of the domains proposed by the WHO should be\ndeveloped to address these concerns.  While the PCOSQ has demonstrated some validity ( Guyatt et al., 2004 ; Jones et al., 2004 ), due to a limited\npopulation used during development and validation, the utility of the scale is\npotentially limited. Specifically, the PCOSQ was developed using patients who\nrepresented only two phenotypes of PCOS, excluding two other phenotypes of PCOS\nrecognised by the current recommended ( National Institutes of Health (NIH), 2012 )\ndiagnostic criteria in the United Kingdom ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus\nWorkshop Group, 2004 ). Specifically, women who present with polycystic\novaries combined with either oligo or anovulation, or indeed, clinical or\nbiochemical signs of hyperandrogenism ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus\nWorkshop Group, 2004 ) were excluded in its development and later\nvalidations ( Guyatt et al.,\n2004 ; Jones et al.,\n2004 ). The perspectives of these women with different symptom profiles,\ntherefore, would not have been considered when developing items for the scale. This\nfurther suggests that aspects of PCOS which impact QoL and are important to women\nwith the condition may have been excluded from the development of the scale. This is\na possible reason for the later critique of the PCOSQ as a measure of symptom-bother\nwhich may exclude important issues for women with PCOS that can impact on QoL ( Malik-Aslam et al., 2010 ).\nA PCOS QoL scale developed to represent all phenotypes of PCOS in a UK population\ncould help to overcome the concerns raised by the ESHRE/ASRM ( The Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored 3rd PCOS\nConsensus Workshop Group, 2012 ) with regard to the limitations of only\none PCOSQOL measure. This article, therefore, details the development and initial\nvalidity testing of the PCOSQOL, a PCOS-specific QoL measure which encompasses areas\nof QoL defined as important by women with the condition.    Methods   Participants and procedure  According to the scale development guidelines ( DeVellis, 2012 ; Streiner and Norman, 2008 ), this scale\ndevelopment took place over four phases, each using distinct participant\nsamples: phase I \u2013 item generation (n\u2009=\u200918 participants), phase II \u2013 scale\nreduction and reliability (n\u2009=\u2009298), phase III \u2013 scale validity and re-test\nreliability (n\u2009=\u2009308) and phase IV \u2013 further validation (n\u2009=\u2009108). Participants\n18\u2009years old and above, who lived in the United Kingdom, had English as a first\nlanguage and experienced the symptoms of PCOS were recruited through UK PCOS\ngroups on Facebook. Participants were not excluded if they experienced co-morbid\nconditions. In phase II, a total of 298 participants, aged 18\u201351\n( M age\u2009=\u200929.54; standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20096.26) years,\ncompleted the prototype PCOSQOL scale. To assess the construct and\ndiscriminative validity, and reliability of the reduced item PCOSQOL, in phase\nIII a second large sample (n\u2009=\u2009308; M age\u2009=\u200929.88; SD =\u20096.90) of participants was recruited. Ninety of these\nparticipants completed the test re-test of the PCOSQOL. To further validate the\nPCOSQOL, in phase IV a third sample of participants was recruited, whose age\nranged from 19 to 49\u2009years ( M age\u2009=\u200930.52; SD =\u20096.51). The participant characteristics from phase II to IV\nof development can be found in Table 1 .   Table 1.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983 ) is a\n14-item scale with seven items for each subscale (Depression/Anxiety) and\neach item is scored from zero to three. Items include \u2018I get sudden feelings\nof panic\u2019 and \u2018I feel cheerful\u2019. The subscales for HADS have demonstrated\ngood internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.80 for the Anxiety\nsubscale and 0.76 for the Depression subscale ( Mykletun et al., 2001 ). Within this\nsample (Phase III), the subscales for HADS demonstrated similar internal\nconsistency with Cronbach\u2019s alphas of 0.72 for the Anxiety subscale and 0.78\nfor the Depression subscale.    WHOQOL-BREF  WHOQOL-BREF ( The WHOQOL\nGroup, 1998 ) has 22 items and uses a 5-point Likert-type scale.\nIt contains four subscales, including Physical Health, Psychological,\nEnvironment and Social Relationships. Questions include issues regarding\nnegative feelings, ability to perform daily activities, capacity to work and\npersonal relationships. Cronbach\u2019s alphas for the scale have been found to\nbe good for three domains: Physical (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.82), Psychological (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.81) and\nEnvironment (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.80) but marginal (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.68) for Social Relationships\n[49]. Cronbach\u2019s alphas for this sample (Phase IV) on the WHOQOL-BREF\ndomains were similar: Physical (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.86), Psychological (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.85),\nEnvironment (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.78) and Social Relationships (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.70).    PCOSQ  PCOSQ ( Cronin et al.,\n1998 ) is a disease-specific QoL measure for women with PCOS. It\nhas 26 items and uses a 7-point Likert-type scale. Questions focus on issues\nconcerning growth of visible hair, infertility problems and feelings of\ndepression. The PCOSQ has five domains: Emotions (eight items), Body Hair\n(five items), Weight (five items), Infertility problems (four items) and\nMenstrual problems (four items). Cronbach\u2019s alpha were above 0.7 when the\nPCOSQ was validated ( Jones et al., 2004 ).     Ethical approval  Ethical approval was obtained from the Psychology Research Ethics Committee at\nthe University of Derby (06012-SW) and all participants gave written informed\nconsent before participating. All data were anonymous, however, participants in\nphase III were asked to provide their email address if they were happy to\ncomplete the test\u2013retest 3\u2009weeks later in order to check the consistency of the\nPCOSQOL over time.    Statistical analysis  Data analyses were conducted using SPSS v22 ( IBM Corp., 2013 ). The factor structure\nwas tested using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Principal axis factoring was\nemployed using a direct oblimin rotation. The internal consistency of the scale\nwas assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Due to aspects of the data violating\nassumptions for parametric tests, Spearman\u2019s correlations were conducted between\nscale scores to assess construct validity. Independent t-tests, however, were\nperformed to assess the discriminative validity of the PCOSQOL by comparing\ndemographic data and condition characteristics.     Results   Phase I: item generation  Scale items were developed from qualitative research exploring QoL in women with\nPCOS (see Williams,\nSheffield and Knibb, 2014 ; 2015 ) and a comprehensive review of the\nliterature. Items were reviewed by an expert panel (n\u2009=\u20095) of PCOS healthcare\nprofessionals and psychologists specialising in disease-specific scale\ndevelopment ( DeVellis,\n2012 ). This resulted in the prototype PCOS QoL (PCOSQOL) scale which\nconsisted of 62-items using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from \u2018Does Not\nApply\u2019 (p. 7) to \u2018Usually\u2019 (p. 1). As such, lower scores represent a decreased\nQoL. Example items included: \u2018Felt under pressure to have a child\u2019 and \u2018Felt\ndepressed about how PCOS has impacted your life\u2019.    Phase II: scale reduction and reliability   Item analysis and reduction  Items in the prototype scale were analysed for frequency, means and\ncorrelations. Analysis of items\u2019 means ( DeVellis, 2012 ) resulted in the\nremoval of five items with item means below 2 (1.78 to 1.92). Two of these\nremoved items related to weight, \u2018Felt under pressure to lose weight\u2019 and\n\u2018Had negative thoughts about your weight\u2019. One item related to the symptom\nof acne, \u2018Felt depressed because of the spots on your face\u2019 was also\nremoved. All items significantly correlated with at least one other item;\nsignificant correlations ranged from 0.14 to 0.79. This resulted in 57 items\nbeing retained.    EFA  An EFA was then run on the data collected (n\u2009=\u2009298). Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin\nmeasure (KMO\u2009=\u2009.906) indicated that sampling adequacy was met. Initially,\nusing eigenvalues above 1 as criteria for factor extraction, 12 factors were\nextracted. However, the scree plot was ambiguous and showed inflexions that\nwould justify retaining either two or four factors. Four factors had\neigenvalues over 2; therefore, the analysis was rerun specifying the\nextraction of four factors and coefficients below 0.45 were suppressed\n( Comrey and Lee,\n1992 ). Of the remaining 57 items, 35 had factor loadings of at\nleast 0.45 and each item loaded onto one factor only. As a result 35 items\nwere retained. After inspection of items loading onto each factor, subscales\nwere labelled: Impact of PCOS, Infertility, Hirsutism and Mood. None of the\nitems relating to bodyweight loaded onto a factor. The results for the\nfactor analysis can be seen in Table 2 .   Table 2.   Factor analysis and Cronbach\u2019s alphas for PCOS-QOL and its\nsubscales.

Phase III: scale validity and re-test reliability  After initial item reduction (detailed above) the 35-item PCOSQOL was\nre-administered to a new sample of women with PCOS (n\u2009=\u2009308) in order to test\ncross-sectional validity of the revised scale.   Cross-sectional validity and correlations   HADS  Spearman\u2019s correlation was run to determine the relationship between the\nPCOSQOL, its subscales and the HADS subscales. The results indicated\nthat women with PCOS with greater levels of anxiety and depression had\npoorer QoL ( Table\n3 ).   Table 3.

EFA  DeVellis\n(2012) states that if data from different samples of\nindividuals on different occasions produce essentially identical factor\nsolutions using exploratory approaches, then the likelihood of those\nresults being a \u2018quirk\u2019 is small. Accordingly, as a part of initial\nvalidation, a second EFA was run on the revised 35-item PCOSQOL\n(n\u2009=\u2009308; KMO\u2009=\u2009.93). Principal axis factoring was employed using a\ndirect oblimin rotation and missing values were excluded pairwise. The\nscree plot supported a four-factor structure. Coefficients below 0.45\nwere suppressed ( Comrey and Lee, 1992 ). The factor analysis showed that all\n35 items loaded onto the same factors as the EFA conducted during\ninitial scale reduction and reliability testing. Cronbach\u2019s alphas for\nthis sample were found to be excellent for the overall scale (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.95)\n( George and\nMallery, 2003 ) and the four subscales; Impact of PCOS,\nInfertility, Hirsutism and Mood (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.95, \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.95, \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.97 and \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.89,\nrespectively).    Test\u2013re-test reliability  A total of 90 of 308 (29%) participants completed a test re-test of the\nPCOSQOL after 3\u2009weeks. Correlational analyses were used to examine the\nrelationship between the 35-item PCOSQOL and the test re-test data.\nResults indicated a strong, positive relationship between the total\nscores of the reduced item PCOSQOL and the test\u2013retest data (missing\ndata excluded pairwise), which was statistically significant\n( rs (57)\u2009=\u2009.90, p\u2009<\u2009.001 BCa confidence interval\n(CI) [.817, .948]). Mean scores were 105.67\n( SD =\u200937.32) for the PCOSQOL and 112.44\n( SD =\u200938.41) for the re-test. This difference\nsuggests that QoL was improved for the participants at the re-test\npoint. This was confirmed by a paired samples t-test which revealed a\nsignificant difference between initial scores of QoL and the re-test,\nt(57)\u2009=\u22122.10, p\u2009<\u20090.05. At re-test, Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the overall\nscale was excellent (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.95) ( George and Mallery, 2003 ) as\nwell as for the four subscales: Impact of PCOS (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.96), Infertility\n(\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.96), Hirsutism (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.97) and Mood (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.89), indicating good\ninternal consistency for each of the subscales.    Discriminative validity  Independent t-tests revealed a significant difference in scores of QoL on\nthe PCOSQOL between those participants who experience symptoms of\ninfertility (t(213)\u2009=\u20091.22, p\u2009<\u20090.001), excess hair (t(213)\u2009=\u20095.10,\np\u2009<\u2009.001), excess weight (t(213)\u2009=\u20093.66, p\u2009<\u2009.001), alopecia\n(t(213)\u2009=\u20092.60, p\u2009<\u2009.05), skin tags (t(213)\u2009=\u20093.45, p\u2009<\u2009.001),\nmood swings (t(213)\u2009=\u20095.53, p\u2009<\u2009.001) or had received a clinical\ndiagnosis of depression (t(205)\u2009=\u2003\u22122.14, p\u2009<\u2009.05) compared to women\nwho had not. There was also a significant lower QoL score for those\nwomen who were trying to conceive compared to those who were not\n(t(193)\u2009=\u2003\u22126.48, p\u2009<\u2009.001).      Phase IV: further validation  To further initial assessments of cross-sectional validity of the PCOSQOL, an\nadditional sample of 108 women with PCOS were recruited.   WHOQOL-BREF  Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between\nthe subscales of the WHOQOL-BREF (Physical Health, Psychological Health,\nSocial Relationships and Environment) and the PCOSQOL (Impact of PCOS,\nInfertility, Hirsutism and Mood). Correlation analyses revealed positive\nsignificant relationships between the PCOSQOL subscales of Impact of PCOS\nand Mood and all the WHOQOL subscales. The PCOSQOL Hirsutism subscale had\npositive weak to moderate correlations with three of the WHOQOL subscales:\nPsychological, Social Relationships and Environment domains. The PCOSQOL\nsubscale demonstrated a significant weak, positive relationship with the\nWHOQOL subscales, Psychological and Environmental QoL ( Table 3 ).    PCOSQ  Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between\nthe PCOSQOL total score and the PCOSQ total score and the subscales of each\nscale ( Table 3 ).\nAll subscales of the PCOSQ correlated with at least one subscale of the\nPCOSQOL except, the PCOSQ subscale of Menstrual Problems that did not\ncorrelate with the total score of the PCOSQOL or its subscales.      Discussion  This article detailed the development and preliminary validation of a PCOS\ndisease-specific QoL scale which would be a more sensitive measure of QoL as defined\nby women with the condition in the United Kingdom. Development resulted in a 35-item\nscale with four subscales: Impact of PCOS, Infertility, Hirsutism and Mood.\nCronbach\u2019s alpha for the overall scale and for each sub-scale was excellent.\nPreliminary validation testing was positive, the scale demonstrated good test\nre-test reliability, demonstrating a robust factor structure and high internal\nconsistency of factor structures.  Items for the PCOSQOL were developed from qualitative findings of previous\nqualitative research ( Williams\net al., 2014 , 2015 ), expert opinion, and from a comprehensive literature review as\nrecommended by Malik-Aslam et\nal. (2010) . As a result, the PCOSQOL includes items which are reflective\nof the psychological, social and environment domains which are important for a QoL\nmeasure ( The WHOQOL Group,\n1994 ). As such, the PCOSQOL may go some way to answering the call for a\nmore sensitive PCOS QoL measure ( Barry et al., 2017 ) that addresses those aspects of QoL important to\nwomen with PCOS ( Malik-Aslam et\nal., 2010 ).  The PCOSQOL includes items reflective of concerns of women with PCOS including the\nimpact of PCOS on feminine identity; the negative impact of PCOS on family and\nfriends; and the feeling of being under pressure to have children. Interestingly,\nitems pertaining to the spirituality/religion/personal belief domain ( The WHOQOL Group, 1994 )\nwere not endorsed by participants in the item reduction phase of the PCOSQOL, nor\nwere any items pertaining to the symptom of the weight. These items therefore were\nnot included in the final 35-item scale. Arguably then, the PCOSQOL does not capture\nevery aspect of QoL as defined by The WHOQOL Group (1994) but includes those\nitems that are reflective of aspects of QoL that are deemed most important to women\nwith PCOS in the United Kingdom ( Fayers and Machin, 2007 ; Osborne et al., 2014 ). This begins to\naddress the differences in QoL noted in global populations of women with PCOS ( A\u00e7maz et al., 2013 ; Bazarganipour et al., 2013 ; Benetti-Pinto et al.,\n2015 ); however, further validation of the PCOSQOL in a UK sample is\nnecessary to assess the utility of the measure.  Recruitment for this study via online Facebook support groups allowed for a large\nsample suitable for scale development. However, recruitment this way limited the\ncontrol over the characteristics of the participant population ( Coulson, 2015 ). For\nexample, although women self-reported that they had received a clinical diagnosis of\nPCOS, it was not possible to verify this. It is also unclear what diagnostic\ncriteria were applied to participants at the time of diagnosis, for example the\nRotterdam Criteria ( The\nRotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ) or\nthe NIH 1991 criteria ( Zawadski\nand Dunaif, 1992 ). To mediate this, participants reported the symptoms\nthey experienced, these included polycystic ovaries, weight gain and hirsutism,\namong others, and suggests that the large sample of participants represented all\nphenotypes of PCOS as detailed in the Rotterdam Criteria ( The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus\nWorkshop Group, 2004 ). Nevertheless, further validation of the PCOSQOL\nwithin a clinical population is necessary to provide more evidence as to the utility\nof this disease-specific measure which would afford hypothesis testing by\nConfirmatory Factory Analysis (confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)).  This article details the development and preliminary validation of the PCOSQOL. While\nfurther validation is necessary (Nunnally, 1978; Streiner and Norman, 2008 ), research has\nproposed the need for a more sensitive QoL measure for women with PCOS ( Barry et al., 2017 ) that\naddresses the psychological impact of the condition on QoL ( Malik-Aslam et al., 2010 ). The PCOSQOL is a\ndisease-specific QoL measure for women with PCOS that explores the impact of the\ncondition on aspects of QoL deemed important by women with PCOS ( Fayers and Machin, 2007 ; Osborne et al.,\n2014 ). This includes psychological, environmental and social domains ( The WHOQOL Group, 1994 ) in\naddition to items reflecting the impact of symptoms. The 35-item PCOSQOL provides a\nresponse to the issues raised by the 2012 Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM group with regard to\nthe limitation of having only one PCOS QoL measure. It demonstrates promising\ninitial validity and reliability in a large non-clinical sample of women with PCOS\nin the UK.",
