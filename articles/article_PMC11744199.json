    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an enigmatic\nendocrinopathy that has a significant impact on the\nlife quality of reproductive aged women. PCOS affects between 2.2 and 26 % of women worldwide ( 1 ).\nIn the Indian population, the prevalence varies from\n3.7 to 22.5% depending on ethnicity and diagnostic\ncriteria ( 2 ). The various phenotypic forms of PCOS\nbegin when a girl steps into her adolescent age. Several traits may evolve during this pubertal transition,\nwhich limits many findings as temporary stabilises\nin later adolescence. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of developing complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, infertility and endometrial hyperplasia\n( 3 ). In addition, it also causes anxiety and depression\nwhich lead to impaired quality of life. Hence, it is\ncrucial to identify high-risk individuals and obtain an\nearly diagnosis to avoid early and later consequences\nof the syndrome.  The pathogenesis of PCOS is very complex and multifactorial including environmental and\ngenetic factors. The elevated inflammatory markers in women with PCOS indicate the role of\nchronic low-grade inflammation ( 4 ). The monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1\n( MCP-1 ) or C-C motif chemokine 2 ( CCL2 ) is one of the\nimportant chemotactic factors for monocytes. The MCP-1 gene is located in\nchromosome 17q11.2 and its protein is formed of 99 amino acids and weighed 13kDa ( 5 ). The\ngenetic variation in the distal regulatory region of the MCP-1 gene (2518\nA/G or rs1024611) influences the expression of the MCP-1 protein. In inflammatory diseases,\nthe homozygous G allele showed an association with high-level protein production ( 6 ). The\nMCP-1 promoter variations A/G and G/G have been reported significantly in various disease\nconditions like myocardial infarction ( 7 ), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus\nnephritis ( 8 ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( 9 ), diabetic foot ulcers ( 10 ), pulmonary tuberculosis\n( 11 ), primary myelofibrosis ( 12 ), promyelocytic leukaemia ( 13 ) and Crohn\u2019s disease ( 14 ) and\nage-related macular degeneration (AMD) ( 15 ) have been reported. Regarding PCOS, a study of\nthe South Korean population reported a significant association of the A allele of MCP-1 (rs1024611) with PCOS ( 16 ). The cause of PCOS may differ depending\non ethnicity and dominant allele differences. As there is no available published data on the\nassociation of the MCP-1 polymorphism in PCOS patients in the Indian\npopulation, we designed the present study.    Materials and Methods  The entire study protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Jubilee Mission Medical\nCollege and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, India\n(47/20/IEC/JMMC&RI); all participants signed a written\nconsent form.   Study subjects  In this case-control study, a total of 1118 women aged\nbetween 15 to 35 years of age participated. Based on the\nRotterdam criteria ( 17 ) 538 were PCOS cases and the\nremaining were non-PCOS. From January 2021 to May\n2022 all patients were consecutively recruited from the\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute (JMMC &\nRI), Thrissur, Kerala, India.    Exclusion criteria for the experimental studies  We excluded all cases with a history of hormonal\ntreatment and contraception within the past 6 months,\npregnancy and the first year of delivery as well as patients with an androgen-secreting ovarian/adrenal tumour, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) or those\nwho are taking antiepileptics, antipsychotics or corticosteroids.    Inclusion criteria for the experimental studies  Among the participants with PCOS (538 cases), we further selected 202 patients based on their paternal and/or\nmaternal inheritance as well as the severity of symptoms\nusing a questionnaire, to get maximum genetic predisposition. These patients exhibited PCOS from menarche\nonwards or showed high severity of symptoms. As a control group, normoandrogenic, consenting, post-pubertal\nand premenopausal women with regular menstrual cycles\nwho were identified as non-PCOS women by clinical or\nbiochemical examination were included (580 cases). Using the same questionnaire, 122 age-matched participants\nwho were non-PCOS in their paternal and maternal relatives up to the second degree of relation, were recruited as\nexperimental controls to minimize genetic predisposition\n( Fig .1 ).   Fig 1   Schematic representation of sampling procedure. PCOS; Polycystic\novary syndrome.     Peripheral blood samples were collected in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainer for biochemical assays and genetic study and stored at -20\u00b0C\nuntil use. Genomic DNA was isolated from the patients\nand control subjects by using the QIAamp DNA Blood\nMini Kit (51104, Qiagen, Germany), and the concentra tion was assessed by a Qubit fluorometer 2.0 (Q32866,\nLife Technologies, CA, USA).    Genotyping  To analyse the association of -2518 A>G (rs1024611) of the MCP-1 gene\nwith PCOS, polymerase chain reaction-fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was\nperformed on all samples. The primers used to amplify the genomic DNA included, forward\nprimer: 5\u00b4-CCG AGA TGT TCC CAG CAC AG- 3\u00b4 and reverse primer: 5\u00b4-CTG CTT TGC TTG TGC CTC\nTT3\u00b4 ( 16 ). The PCR was performed in the total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcL containing 100ng\ngenomic DNA, 1x EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix (RR310, Takara Bio USA, Inc.) and 0.3\npicomoles of each oligonucleotide primer. The PCR cycle condition consisted of an initial\ndenaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 minute, 65\u00b0C\nfor 25 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 45 seconds and the final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nSubsequently, RFLP was done in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL. Ten \u03bcL of PCR product was\ndigested with the 1 \u03bcL PvuII restriction endonuclease (from Proteus\nvulgaris ) (R0151S, Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania)\nwith 2 \u03bcL of the buffer (rCutSmart Buffer). After 1 hour of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the\ncleaved products were size-fractionated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis for 2 hours with\nethidium bromide detection ( Fig .2 ). Samples showing a single 930 bp fragment were assigned\nas homozygous genotype AA, samples with 708 bp and 222 bp fragments as GG homozygous, and\nthose with three fragments (930 bp, 708 bp, and 222 bp) as heterozygous genotype AG. As\npart of the quality control measurement, random samples were sent for Sanger sequencing\nand reconfirmed with PCR-RFLP for each of the three genotypes ( Fig .3 ).

Statistical analysis  The frequency distributions of different parameters,\nsuch as genotypes and alleles were analysed by the Chisquare test. An unpaired t test was applied to compare\nthe mean of continuous variables (IBM SPSS version 26,\nUSA). We performed the chi-square test and odds ratios\n(OR) [confidence intervals (CI,95%)] using online tools\nlike SISA and MedCalc. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results  PCOS patients were recruited as per the 2003 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM consensus ( 17 ). The patients were\nidentified by ultrasonography, hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea conditions. Women with PCOS showed a\nsignificantly high body weight, body mass index (BMI)\nand obesity as compared to our control subjects. Patients\ndiagnosed with PCOS from menarche onwards or with\nhigher severity of symptoms were only included in the\ngenetic study (n=202). Among the other clinical parameters, infertility and abortion were also shown significant\nassociations with PCOS incidences, but the count of participants in these categories was observed as disproportional ( Table 1 ).  In our study, PCOS patients had much greater rates of\nreproductive difficulties such as infertility and abortions\nthan controls. Obesity (BMI \u226525) was identified in 120\nPCOS patients (59%) and 22% of the control group. During the clinical observation, one proband, 37 fathers, 8 mothers and 66 first-degree relatives of the proband were\naffected by CVD.  The distribution and association of alleles and genotypes of MCP-1 polymorphism among the study subjects are presented in Table 2. We observed a similar\ndistribution of A and G alleles between the women with\nPCOS and the control group (P=0.081). The analysis of\nthe MCP-1 gene polymorphism (rs1024611) showed no\nsignificant association with a higher risk for the development of PCOS.

In our study, obesity (BMI \u226525) was\nfound in 95 PCOS patients (51%), and also 16% of the control group. In obese PCOS individuals, AA, AG, and GG\ngenotypes were observed in 51, 34 and 15% respectively.\nIn non-obese PCOS, it was 47, 38 and 15% ( Table 3 ). However, we found no significant difference in the genotype\nand allele frequencies between obese and non-obese PCOS\npatients. In the control group, the distribution of AA, AG\nand GG genotypes was 47, 47 and 5% respectively.

PCOS; Polycystic ovary syndrome and CI; Confidence intervals.       Discussion  PCOS is one of the major endocrine disorders of women of childbearing age. Genetic variations like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered to have a\npivotal role in several disease conditions. Genetic variation in the promoter region can increase, decrease, or even\ndisrupt protein expression ( 18 ). In this study, we analysed\nthe association of one of the MCP-1 promoter polymorphisms, rs1024611, in a population of Indian-origin women.  Previous reports showed that infertility and miscarriage\nare more common in PCOS women ( 19 ). We observed a\nhigh prevalence of reproductive problems among PCOS\npatients when compared to the control group, which is\nconsistent with these findings. When comparing general\nmeasurement data from patients in the obese PCOS and\nnon-obese PCOS groups, features such as atypical menstruation, hirsutism, acne, and infertility were identified\nas characteristics of PCOS. According to the BMI categorization done by WHO standards ( 20 ) for Asian females,\nthe majority of PCOS females were obese, highlighting\nthe issue of the prevalence of fat in females. Obese women\nare more likely to develop problems such as hypertension,\ndiabetes, CVD, and other metabolic diseases, all of which\ncontribute to the development of PCOS ( 21 ). Similar to\nthe previous findings, we observed a higher percentage\nof PCOS among obese women than in the healthy control\ngroup.  Thathapudi et al. ( 22 ) reported the link between obesity\nand PCOS in South Indian patients. However, no data are\navailable on the association of MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism with obese and non-obese PCOS. In our study,\nwe could not find any association of this polymorphism\nwith obese and non-obese PCOS.  Taylor et al. ( 23 ) reported a high risk for CVD events\nin the fathers of PCOS patients in comparison with their\nmothers. A study conducted in India underlined the risk\nfactor of first-degree relatives for CVD events ( 24 ) and\nlater on, the same research group published the higher\njeopardizing factor for CVD for the siblings too ( 25 ).\nIn our study, we investigated the association of MCP-1 rs1024611 polymorphism with CVD in the proband firstdegree relatives. Even though CVD is a high-risk factor\nfor first-degree relatives in PCOS conditions, we could\nnot identify any significant difference for both genotype\nor allele frequencies with CVD.  Previous studies on inflammatory diseases showed a significant association with MCP-1 rs1024611 polymorphism. A study conducted in a Japanese population\nrevealed a significantly higher amount of plasma MCP-1 level in the atherosclerosis\npatients\u2019 group ( 26 ). Likewise, higher expression levels of MCP-1 have been reported in\ncoronary artery disease ( 27 ), diabetic foot ulcer ( 28 ) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( 29 ) in the\nHans Chinese population. In 2009, Chronic Periodontitis in end-stage renal disease patients\nin the Caucasian population ( 6 ) also reported the same findings. All these studies showed a\nsignificant association of these inflammatory diseases with the MCP-1 -2518\nG/G genotype. These studies showed the significance of the G/G genotype in the patients\ncompared to the control. Regarding PCOS, Hu et al. ( 30 ) reported an elevated level of MCP-1\nin PCOS patients. Li et al. ( 16 ) reported an association of the A allele of MCP-1 rs1024611 with PCOS in the Korean population. However, in our\nstudy, we observed an absence of association of the A allele of MCP-1 rs1024611 with PCOS susceptibility. Although, the cause of the disparities is unknown,\nreporting bias, ethnicity and varied inclusion or exclusion criteria may be the potential\nreason behind it. A recent meta-analysis by Wu et al. ( 31 ) revealed that the circulating\nMCP-1 protein levels are upregulated in PCOS women and are associated with an increased risk\nof PCOS. However, we could not carry out expression analysis due to insufficient sample\nvolume. Hence, we were unable to correlate expression levels of MCP-1 with\nPCOS.    Conclusion  In our study, we could not find any significant association of the MCP-1 rs1024611 polymorphism with in Indian PCOS women.",
