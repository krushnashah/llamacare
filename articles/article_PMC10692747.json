    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological disorder associated with abdominal\nobesity (AO) and some reproductive complications including low pregnancy rate. Embryo-endometrium cross-talk\nhas a key role in successful embryo implantation and subsequent normal pregnancy rate. The primary objective of\nthis study is to evaluate the decidualization potential of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) using the embryo condition\nmedia (ECM) collected from PCOS patients with AO, compared to ECM of those patients without AO. In this experimental study, we measured the capacity of ECM collected from PCOS patients\nwith or without AO for decidualization induction in healthy ESCs after coculture. A total number of 53 embryos from\n40 couples belonging to PCOS with AO, PCOS without AO, nonPCOS with AO, and nonPCOS without AO patients,\nwere included in our study. The embryosof four groups were single-cultured up to the blastocyst stage. Their ECM\n(45\u03bb/well) were pooled and added to healthy ESCs monolayer culture media to investigate their effects on decidualization\npotential via gene ( The morphological analysis, migration assay (P\u22640.0321), protein (P\u22640.0139) and gene expression analysis\nshowed PCOS with AO accounted for the highest gene ( Considering decidualization as an inflammatory process, a higher level of decidualization markers was\nassociated with a higher inflammatory status created by AO and PCOS, separately. Inflammation may disrupt the process\nof inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phase required for prevention of pregnancy loss, this could explain the high\nrate of abortion in these cases.",
    "body": "Introduction  In recent years, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\ndiverted the attention to the reproductive-age women,\nwho suffer of this disorder with a 4-21% prevalence\nrate ( 1 ). PCOS has been considered a heterogenic\nendocrine and metabolic disorder with pathological\ncharacteristics includes hyperandrogenemia (HA),\nanovulation, polycystic ovary disease, obesity, insulin\nresistance (IR), and infertility. This syndrome has been recognized as a low-grade chronic inflammatory\ndisease, but the exact mechanism of this association\nhas not been fully understood. It has been demonstrated\nthat both natural and assisted reproductive technology\n(ART) cycles in PCOS patients are challenging\ndue to low pregnancy rate, reduced live birth rate\nand high miscarriage rate even after a high-quality\nembryos transfer in ART plans ( 2 ). It seems that other\npathological complications, including endometrial insufficiency, may contribute to the pathogenesis of\ninfertility disorders ( 3 ).  Recent evidence shows that IR, HA and obesity\nplay an essential role in the PCOS pathogenesis\nand its consequences ( 4 ). Obesity contributes to\none of the most critical complications among PCOS\nwomen, in terms of their reproduction ( 5 ). Obesity\n(body mass index, BMI>30) affects 61-76% of these\npatients ( 6 ). A cohort study in more than 9500 ART\ncycles indicates that obesity may lead to embryonic\nimplantation failure, which is caused by an impaired\nendometrial receptivity ( 7 ). In PCOS patients, the\npresence of metabolic disorders, inflammation and\nendocrine abnormalities, the same features that we\nobserve in obesity, play a significant role in ovulation\nfunction, oocyte quality, endometrial receptivity and\nmiscarriage rate ( 8 ). The implantation disorder and\nabortion occurrence in these patients indicate that the\ncross-talk between the embryo and the endometrium is\nprobably disturbed.  Naturally, successful embryo implantation depends\non a receptive endometrium, the presence of a goodquality\nblastocyst, and synchronization of embryoendometrium\ncross-talk. In addition, before the\nembryo\u2019s implantation, there is a communication\nbetween the uterus and the blastocyst that occurs\nduring a specific period of time in which implantation\nis possible ( 9 ).  There is an evidence that the embryo-endometrium\ncross-talk is carried out through the secretion of\nvarious factors by an embryo ( 10 ). Previous studies\nshowed that interleukins, immunosuppressive factors\nand growth factors can be isolated from the embryo\ncondition media (ECM) ( 11 ). In order to induce\nthe expression of integrins, endometrial leukemia\ninhibitory factor, and other inflammatory factors\nthat improve the rate of implantation via facilitating\nembryo-endometrium cross-talk ( 12 ).  Endometrial receptivity, a physiological changes\ncomplex, provides an appropriate environment for\nthe different phases of an embryo implantation,\nincluding the opposition, attachment, invasion, and\ndecidualization. In humans, decidualization occurs\nroutinely during the latter half of each menstrual\ncycle and disappears in the absence of an embryo\nin the endometrium ( 13 ). Decidualization is a\nmorphological and functional change of stromal cells\nunder ovarian steroidal hormones (estrogen; E2 and\nprogesterone; P4) secretion to prepare these cells to\naccept the embryo ( 14 ). Prolactin (PRL) and insulin\nlike growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) are\ntwo specific markers of decidualization process ( 15 ).\nIn addition, homeboxA10 (HOXA10) is an essential\ninducer factor for promoting decidualization ( 16 ).\nInduction of decidualization requires the expression of\ninflammatory cytokines and low-grade inflammation\nsuch as interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\u03b2) ( 17 ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) ( 17 ), and IL-6 ( 18 ). It has\nbeen shown that an excessive inflammation in the\nimplantation process can enhance the decidualization\nprocess ( 19 ).  Considering that in ART, the embryo is cultured\nuntil the blastocyst stage on day 5, the cross-talk\nbetween the uterus and the embryo may be lost. For\nthis purpose, Goto et al. ( 20 ) evaluated a new method\ncalled stimulation of endometrium embryo transfer\n(SEET). In their experiment, ECM from a fresh cycle\nwas frozen and then injected into the uterus of patients\nbefore blastocyst transfer, that led to an increase in\nthe pregnancy rate. Therefore, this approach may help\nus to define the embryo capacity for decidualization\ninduction in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) which\nrequired for embryo implantation.  The implantation rate following a blastocyst transfer\nhas been around 4-55% worldwide, and it has remained\nconstant over the last decades ( 21 ). A higher rate of live\nbirth in a blastocyst transfer procedure in comparison\nwith the cleavage stage transfer, placed it in the first\nline of ART. Accordingly, the embryo- endometrial\ncross talk lack can be accounted for main reason of\na low implantation rate after in vitro embryo transfer\n( 22 ). An impaired decidualization creates a series of\nreproductive disorders e.g., miscarriage, implantation\nand various pregnancy complications ( 13 ).  The exact mechanism by which the PCOS and\nabdominal obesity (AO) may affect the outcome of\nboth natural and ART cycles is not yet well understood.\nTherefore, in the present study, we intend to investigate\nthe independent roles of PCOS or/and obesity on the\nimplantation rate of embryos which is characterized\nby ESCs decidualization process.    Materials and Methods  This experimental study was approved by the\nEthical Committee of Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran\n(IR.ACECR.ROYAN.REC.1400.004). All volunteer\nparticipants submitted their written informed consent.\nAll volunteer participants were invited among aged\n25-35 infertile couples who had referred to the\nRoyan Institute Tehran, Iran, between 1st May until 1st\nDecember in 2021.  For isolating ESCs, we had to invite healthy married\nfertile women who were referred to the Royan Clinic,\nTehran, Iran, for a diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain\nwithout any uterine abnormality. After describing the aim\nand procedure of our study, of those who were volunteering\nto take part in this trial expressed their willingness and\nprovided their self-signed consent for participation.   Study population and group design  Totally, 53 infertile couples, including PCOS\naffected and normal oogenesis women participated in\nthis experimental study. According to the Rotterdam criteria, 25 women diagnosis a PCOS affected. The\nnormal group included 28 normal oogenesis women\nwho were placed in the ART indication due to their\nhusbands\u2019 infertility. Different plans, including in\nvitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm\ninjection (ICSI) and frozen embryo transfer (FET)\nwere considered for them. The participants were\ndivided into four subgroups: the PCOS patients with\nAO (waist/hip ratio \u22650.80) named as PCOS+- AO+\ngroup. The PCOS patients without AO named as PCOS+-\nAO\u2013 group. Non-PCOS patients with AO considered\nas PCOS--AO+ group, and non-PCOS patients without\nAO were as PCOS--AO- group. We designed two\nsupplementary groups, ESCs treatment neither ECM nor\ninduction medium [control induction (CI)] and ESCs\nwhich were treated with only induction medium [control\nsupernatant (CS)]. The participants who suffered\nan obvious sign of systemic inflammatory diseases,\nincluding diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism,\nhyperthyroidism, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), gout,\nrheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus\nerythematosus were excluded of this study. Also,\npatients without at least three months before the start of\nthe present study anti-inflammatory drug consumption\nhistory were included Ibuprofen, Diclofenac and\nMefenamic acid made this dug box.    Embryo condition media preparation   Ovarian hyperstimulation and embryo freeze\ntransfer protocol  Our patients underwent standard ovarian stimulation\nprotocol, according to age \u226436 years ( 23 ). For this aim,\nduring the first 6 days of their menstrual cycle, 150 IU of the\nrecombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (follitropin-b,\nMSD, Ballerup, Denmark) was injected daily. On day 2\nor 3, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) was performed\nuntil ovulation induction. Through the serial vaginal\nultrasonography monitoring, on day 6, 0.25 mg dosage\nof GnRH antagonist (Ganirelix-Orgalutranw; MSD,\nBallerup, Denmark) was used in a daily injection. When\nthe patients had at least 2-3 retrievable follicles with an\naverage diameter of \u226513 mm, 6500IU dosage of the human\nchorionic gonadotrophin (hCG, Ovitrelle; Merk Serono,\nHellerup, Denmark) was used to induce final oocyte\nmaturation. The \u201cFreeze all strategy\u201d was performed for\nthe high-risk ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS)\npatients who had more than 15 follicles. Our patients who\nhad <15 follicles and/or estradiol level <3000, received a\n10000 IU hCG. Oocytes retrieved was performed 36-38\nhours after hCG injection using a standard ultrasonically\nguided follicular puncture. Subsequently, these oocytes\nunderwent an IVF/ICSI process.  The vitrification and warming were performed\naccording to the previously protocols ( 24 ). For this\naim the 3rd of embryos culture, high quality ones (\u22658\ncells and \u226425% fragmentation) were incubated for\n5-15 minutes at the room temperature (RT) in the equilibrium solution. Then, the embryos were placed 1\nminutes at RT in the vitrification solution.  For warming, the Cryotop was taken out of liquid\nnitrogen and the embryos were exposed for 50-60\nseconds at 37.0\u00b0C to the thawing solution. Then, the\nembryos were transferred into the dilution solution\n(0.5 mol/L sucrose) for 3 minutes at RT. After which,\nthe embryos were converted to another solution (0.25\nmol/L sucrose) for 3 minutes at RT. The warmed\nembryos were washed four or five times in washing\nsolution (VitROwash medium supplemented with 20%\nAlbuminal-5) and then cultured in SAGE-1 stepTM\n(ORIGIO\u00ae CULTURE MEDIA, Denmark) until day 5.\nAfter 48 hours culture, the embryos were transferred to\nmother\u2019s uterus in the FET cycle and the ECM residual\nwere collected and stored at -080\u00b0C until use. Our study\nparticipants included 53 embryos from 40 infertile\ncouples (25 PCOS and 28 normal oogenesis) who\nwere subdivided into patients with or without AO. It\nis as follows: PCOS+-AO+ (n=12), PCOS+-AO- (n=13),\nPCOS--AO+ (n=13) and PCOS--AO- (n=15).     Endometrial stromal cells isolation and in vitro culture  The tissue biopsies of healthy participants were\nobtained during the secretory phase of the menstrual\ncycle. The collected biopsies were transferred to a\nmedium for transfer containing phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS, Gibco, USA) (0.8 g NaCl, 1.44 g Na3HPO4,\n0.2 g KCl, and 0.24 g KH2PO4), 2% pen/strep (Gibco,\nUSA) and 1% anti-fungal (Gibco, USA). Then, tissue\nbiopsies were washed in the PBS three to four times\nunder the sterile condition in a petry dish (Falcon,\nUSA). After mechanical digestion, the collected tissue\nbiopsies (\u22481 mm3) were transferred to an enzymatic\ndigestion medium (0.0125 g of collagenase type IV,\nGibco, USA), dissolved in 5 ml of Dulbecco\u2019s modified\neagle medium nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM-F12,\nGibco, USA), then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a water bath.\nThe digested samples were filtered through 100, and\n40 \u03bcm mesh filter, respectively. The final filtered\ncells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 20 minutes.\nThe sediment was suspended in 1 ml of DMEM-F12\nmedium (1.2 g DMEM-F12, 0.24 g NaHCO3, 0.005 g\npenicillin, and 0.006 g streptomycin) containing 15%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Primary ESCs\nwere cultured up to first passage, due to long term in\nvitro culture can alter their decidualization potential\n( 25 ). After first passage, 70000 cells/150\u03bb were\ntransferred to each 24-well dish (Falcon).    Decidualization induction of endometrial stromal\ncells  To induce in vitro decidualization conditions in the\nESCs, in each well of 24 wells, 200 \u03bcL of induction\nmedium including DMEM-F12+FBS 2%+8-Br-cyclic\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP, 0.5 mM, Sigma)\nand medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 1 \u03bcM; Sigma)\nwere added and incubated at 37\u00baC, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The ESCs morphological change during 48 hours\nafter decidualization induction was recorded by light\nmicroscopy and was including appearance of rounded,\nepithelioid\u2010like cells.    Culture of induced endometrial stromal cells with the\nembryo condition media  The primary induced ESCs were cultured with the ECM\ncollected from different experimental groups [PCOS + -AO + (n=12), PCOS + -AO \u2013 (n=13), PCOS - -AO + (n=13) and PCOS - -\nAO - (n=15)]. For this aim, 150 \u03bcL/well of pooled ECM (30%\ndilution: 30% ECM+70% DMEM-F12 with 10% FBS) was\nadded per well in 24 wells and incubated for 12 hours ( 26 ).    Evaluation of decidualization capacity in cultured\ninduced cells with the embryo condition media  For all groups, the ECM was removed after a 12 hours\nexposure of the ESCs with the ECM and replaced by\nthe media culture (DMEM-F12 supplemented with\n10% FBS). Then, the collected condition media were\nstored at -80\u00b0C until evaluation by Enzyme linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). The concentration of\ntwo decidualization biomarkers PRL (M06L1H1, ng/ml,\nMonokit Prolactin ELISA Kit inc., Iran), and IGFBP-1\n(ZB-OEH543211103-21, ng/ml, Zellbio assay kit Inc.,\nGermany), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL1-\u03b2\n(HL1-0222002, pg/ml, Biotech assay kit Inc., Iran) was\nevaluated using commercial ELISA kits, according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol.    Assessment of migratory capacity in endometrial\nstromal cells cultured with the embryo condition\nmedia  The wound healing assay was performed according\nto our previous study ( 23 ) with some modification due\nto ECM limitation in this study for this aim, we used\n24 well plate for performing a modified wound healing\nassay to investigate the migration capacity of ESCs. Then\n70.000 cells were seeded into each well of 24 well plate.\nA wound was created by a sterile christal pipette tip on the\ncentre of each well. Subsequently, the ESCs were treated\nwith 0.1 mg/ml of mitomycin C (Sigma) to prevent cell\nproliferation for 2 hours, followed by washing samples\ntwice with 1% PBS. Then, 200 \u03bcL DMEM-F12+10% FBS\nwere added to each well. The ESCs migration capacity\nwas evaluated at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after wounding.\nThe grove width was measured at each time point, using\nImage J software following the below formula:  Measuring of narrowing furrow width in each time\npoint=The width of the grove at 0 time-The width of\ngrove width at each time point    Evaluation of decidualization gene markers expression\nin endometrial stromal cells treated with embryo\ncondition media  ESCs were stored in RNA protect solution (Cat. No. 76526, Qiagen, Germany) at -80\u00b0C. After thawing,\nESCs were centrifuged and total RNA was extracted\nusing RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA quantity was assessed\nusing \u201cNanodrop One\u201d spectrophotometer (Thermo\nScientific\u2122, Germany) Subsequently, 11 \u03bcg RNA\nwas converted into cDNA per manufacturer\u2019s Reverse\nTranscription kit instruction (SMO-BIO, Taiwan).  All primers were designed by using Primer-BLAST\nsoftware (NCBI Primer-BLAST website, Table 1 ).\nPrimers were assessed for specificity, dimers and splice\nvariant detection if applicable. Quantitative polymerase\nchain reactions (PCRs) were conducted using SYBR\nGreen (Thermo Scientific\u2122) on StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-\nTime PCR System (Thermo Scientific\u2122), according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in strips. Samples\nreactions were done in duplicate. For each reaction, 2 \u03bcl\ncDNA and 8 \u03bcl master mix was used.

RNA was extracted from ESCs which were cultured for\n2 days in induction medium supplemented with cAMP and\nMPA and next 12 hours with ECM. followed by culture in\nECM from four patients and two control groups, qRT-PCR\nwas conducted to evaluate PRL, IGFBP1, IL1-\u03b2, HOXA10,\nIL-6 , and TNF-\u03b1 expression among the studied groups.    Statistical analysis  In this research, SPSS version 26 Software (IBM, Germany)\nwas used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were\nexpressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and categorical\nvariables were expressed as number (%). The normality of the\ninvestigated variables was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nIn case of normality, the one-way ANOVA test and Tukey\u2019s\npost hoc test, and in case of non-normality, Kruskal-Varis and\nConover\u2019s post hoc test were used, and the significance level\nof P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All qPCR\nresults were analysed using the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT , as a relative expression\nmethod. Chi-square was used to test the possible differences in pregnancy rate among the studied groups. All graphs\nwere drawn using the GraphPad Prism version 9 Software\n(GraphPad, San Diego, CA).     Results  Our study participants included 25 PCOS and 28\nnormal oogenesis subdivided into patients with or without\nAO. Analysis of BMI showed no significant differences\nbetween the studied groups ( Table 2 ).   Decidualization induction in endometrial stromal cells\ncultured  After decidualization induction, the morphological\nchanges of ESCs cells were recorded by light microscopy\nand visualized ( Fig .1 ).

Gene expression analysis  The qRT-PCR results were illustrated in Figure 4. Analysis of decidualization markers showed a\nsignificant highest expression of PRL in the PCOS + -\nAO + group among our groups (P\u22640.009). Moreover,\nthe PCOS - -AO + group showed significantly higher\nPRL expression level than the PCOS - -AO \u2013 group\n(P=0.0128). The same trend was observed for IGFBP-1 gene, but the differences were not\nstatistically significant due to high variation among\nthe individuals in the PCOS + -AO + group. Moreover,\nthe PCOS + -AO + group showed significantly highest\nexpression of level HOXA10 in comparison with\namong our groups (P\u22640.0248). These results show\nhigher decidualization properties in the PCOS + -AO + group.  Analysis of decidualization related genes showed\nhighest expression level of IL-1\u03b2 in the PCOS+-AO+\ngroup among our groups, while this difference was\nsignificant in comparison with the CS (P=0.013),\nand CI groups (P=0.0095). The expression level of TNF-\u03b1 was significantly highest in the PCOS+-AO+\ngroup among our groups, including PCOS--AO+ group\n(P=0.0039), PCOS - -AO - group (P=0.0005), CS group\n(P=0.0004), and CI group (P=0.0004). The lowest\nexpression level of IL-6 was belonged to the PCOS+-\nAO+ group (0.0029 \u00b1 0.0025) in comparison with\nother groups. The CI group (409.4 \u00b1 354.5) showed a\nsignificant highest expression level of IL-6 among our\ngroups (P<0.05, Table 2 ).

Recently, it was suggested that the\nECM can be used to evaluate the capacity of embryo to\ninduce decidualization representing the in vitro embryo\nimplantation potential ( 27 ). Accordingly, ECM samples\nwere obtained of PCOS patients, with and without of AO,\nand also healthy fertile women to evaluate the potential of\ndecidualization induction in the primary ESCs.  In the present study, we showed that the markers of ECMinduced\ndecidualization in PCOS + -AO + were significantly\nincreased compared to other groups. Accordingly,\ndecidualization induction by the ECM from the\nPCOS + -AO + group caused a change in the morphology of\nESCs, as well as a significant increase in the concentration\nof secreted PRL, although there is no significant difference\nbetween IGFBP-1, and IL-1\u03b2 proteins secretion between\ngroups. Moreover, we observed higher expression of PRL,\nIGFBP-1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and HOXA10 genes in ESCs\nfrom different groups. Nonetheless, the expression of IL-\n6, as an acute phase response stimulator, was decreased\nin the PCOS+-AO+ group, along with the highest rate\nof migration capacity which was observed in cultured\ndecidualized ESCs with their ECM.  Notably, it has been demonstrated that PCOS patients\nhave a larger number of retrieved oocytes in comparison\nwith normal oogenesis individuals. The PCOS patients\nexperience a lower live birth rate and also, a higher\nspontaneous abortion rates ( 28 ). It was suggested that,\ndisrupted decidualization process, endometrial receptivity\nand subsequent blastocyst implantation may be involved\nin these outcomes.  Based on the contribution of proinflammatory cytokines\nin the etiology of PCOS, it was suggested that this disease\ncan be considered as an inflammatory disease ( 29 ).\nEvidences show that HA and IR, two main complications\nof syndrome, may play a role in inflammation induction\nin women with PCOS ( 30 ). Moreover, obesity is a known\ncondition that activates inflammatory pathways in cells\nand tissue. It has been shown that the triglyceride storage\nprocess is disturbed in the PCOS patients with increase\nof free fatty acids which could lead to a state of IR.\nInflammation cytokines can lead to IR by disrupting the\ninsulin post receptor signalling pathway. The relationship\nbetween HA, IR, and chronic inflammation is still not\nfully understood ( 31 ).  While a chronic inflammation may disrupt fertility\nrelated process in healthy women, a low level acute\nendometrial inflammation is necessary for successful\nembryo implantation ( 19 ). It has been showed that an\ninflammatory response in the uterine mucosa is required\nprior to blastocyst invasion ( 32 ). Therefore, Proinflammatory\ncytokines can produce by multiple source\nincluding embryo secretory profile, maternal immune\ncells such as natural killer cells (NKc), macrophages,\ndendritic cells, and ESCs ( 33 ).  Therefore, the ESCs can produce pro-inflammatory\ncytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 at this critical stage.\nSimilar studies have been observed that PCOS patients\nhave higher level of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 in comparison with\nnon-PCOS patients ( 34 ). It has been suggested that the\nearly detection of such cytokines in the endometrium may\nbe considered as markers of an implantation competency\n( 19 ). In the present study, we observed that IL-6 level\ndecreased significantly in the PCOS + -AO + group. Scheller\net al. ( 35 ) reported that IL-6 seems to possess both pro\ninflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The\nassociation of IL-6 levels with PCOS susceptibilities has\nbeen investigated in several studies ( 36 ). However, the\nresults were controversial, failing to find a clear role of\nIL-6 in pathogenesis of PCOS.  In this study, the PCOS + -AO + group showed the\nhighest expression of decidualization markers. It has\nbeen explained that, inflammatory process is required\nfor improvement of decidualization and implantation\nwithin days of conception ( 19 ). Accordingly, all the\ndecidualization markers investigated in this study also\nhas been considered as inflammatory markers in previous\nstudy. It seems that pro inflammatory cytokines are\nenriched in a PCOS associated AO conditions which\ncan lead to higher induction of decidualization in the\nPCOS + -AO + group in comparison with other groups.  The association of increasing decidualization markers\nand endometrial receptivity has been demonstrated in other\nstudies ( 37 ). Our result show that embryos collected from\nPCOS patients have higher potency for a decidualization\ninduction in healthy endometrial receptivity. Zhao et al.\n( 38 ) reported that IR and hyperinsulinemia (HI), two main\ncomplication of PCOS, may exacerbate the endometrial\nreceptivity. Our results including a higher expression of\nlevel decidualization markers in the ESCs co-cultured with\nECM was consistent with this report. Therefore, we may\nconclude that the ECM collected from the PCOS+-AO+\ngroup, may increase the endometrial decidualization and\nsubsequent endometrial receptivity. Due to an increased\nendometrium receptivity in these patients, even suboptimal\nembryos may likely implant, which subsequently may\nresult a higher abortion rate ( 39 ). In the other hand, It has\nbeen shown that a pre-inflammatory response followed\nby an anti-inflammatory phase is necessary for successful\nin mammalian embryo implantation ( 40 ). We suggest that\nthe uterine microenvironment may switch disruptively\nfrom an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phase\nin the PCOS + -AO + women. We can propose that higher\nabortion rate in PCOS patients may arise from these two\npossible hypotheses. In the present study, abortion rate was\nevaluated but it was not significant that it seems because\nof our participants number limitation or due to freeze\nembryo transfer indication. However, several studies\nshown that abortion rate was higher in these patients ( 39 ).  Controversially, several studies showed that endometrial\nreceptivity potential can be decreased in PCOS patients\ndue to metabolic alterations, inflammatory events, and some abnormally expressed endometrial molecular\nmarkers ( 38 ). In these studies, the decidualization\ncapacity of endometrial cells which obtained from PCOS\npatients was not intended. Also, we did not examine the\ndecidualization phenotype of ESCs collected from our\nPCOS patients then, we don't have a clear view of the\nESCs of these PCOS patients. Further studies with large\npopulation are needed to clarify the decidualization\ncapacity of ESCs collected from the PCOS patients under\ntreatment of their ECM.    Conclusion  Our results showed that the collected embryos\nfrom PCOS patients with AO have elevated level of\ninflammatory mediators leading to the higher potential\nfor decidualization induction in the healthy ESCs. This\nresult may be employed for future therapeutic approach\nin which the increased decidualization capacity and\nreceptivity of ESCs are intended.",
