    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders and is characterized by polycystic ovaries, anovulation, and hyperandrogenism [ 1 , 2 ]; PCOS affects approximately 20% of women of reproductive age [ 3 , 4 ] and has lifelong consequences for health and wellbeing [ 5 \u2013 7 ]. Although polygenes and multiple factors are involved in the pathophysiology of PCOS [ 8 ], effective biological targets and therapeutic drugs remain unsatisfactory. Thus, innovative treatment strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy are highly required.  Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the proinflammatory microenvironment in the ovary plays significant roles in the pathogenesis of PCOS [ 9 ]. Macrophages, the most abundant immune cell type in the ovaries, are reported to exert considerable effects on ovarian homeostasis and function [ 10 \u2013 12 ]. Traditionally, macrophages are categorized into classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) subtypes, and the balance of M1 and M2 macrophages is essential for the immunological milieu within the ovary [ 13 ]. The abundance of macrophages with the proinflammatory M1 phenotype accelerates the inflammatory response in the ovaries [ 14 ], and potentially contributes to the progression of PCOS [ 15 , 16 ]. Researches have demonstrated that an imbalance in the ovarian immune status further impairs granulosa cell (GC) proliferation, ovarian follicular development and ovulation [ 14 ], resulting in poor oocyte quality and IVF outcomes [ 17 ]. Considering that macrophages act as drivers and regulators of ovarian functions [ 18 ], achievements that either reduce the amount and function of M1 or increase M2 activity are essential for the treatment of PCOS. Intriguingly, macrophages have been reported to be highly heterogeneous and can shift from one phenotype to another in response to the surrounding microenvironment [ 19 ], and studies have also confirmed that regulation of macrophage infiltration lowers the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and remarkably ameliorates the function of GCs and PCOS-associated clinical outcomes [ 20 , 21 ]. Therefore, discouraging the immune activation of macrophages would be considered a promising and significant therapeutic strategy to relieve the symptoms of PCOS.  Recently, nanoceria (CeO 2 ) has been widely applied in disease diagnosis and therapy due to its favorable antioxidant capacity [ 22 ]. Studies have demonstrated that CeO 2 not only reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but also suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization [ 23 , 24 ]. These results indicated the outstanding potential of CeO 2 in scavenging excessive ROS and reducing macrophage infiltration. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant protective agent during PCOS [ 25 , 26 ]. As a notable metabolic modulator, RSV can reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and promote the transformation of macrophages into the M2 type [ 27 , 28 ]. However, the therapeutic application of RSV remains limited because of its instability and poor systemic bioavailability [ 29 , 30 ].  To address these issues, in the present study, we encapsulated the powerful immunomodulatory drug RSV into CeO 2 through chemical bonding (CeO 2 @RSV), which was delivered to the ovaries to regulate the immune microenvironment and relieve the inflammatory response in PCOS (Scheme 1 ). The synthesized CeO 2 @RSV nanoparticles (NPs) mainly possess the following advantages: (1) The chemical bonding of RSV to CeO 2 expands the antioxidant activity of the CeO 2 nanozymes. (2) Surface-bound RSV may extend the anti-inflammatory capacity and play a congenerous role in dual-directional immunoregulation via macrophage polarization. (3) The CeO 2 @RSV nanocomposites also exhibited high biocompatibility and drug delivery capabilities to the ovaries and ameliorated ovarian injury in vivo. As a result, our NPs can effectively suppress inflammation response-mediated injury and alleviate endocrine dysfunction in PCOS mice, thereby achieving prominent treatment in PCOS therapy. Our findings provide new insights into the immunomodulation of PCOS and broaden the application of nanomaterials as delivery systems. Scheme 1 Schematic illustration of the synthesis process and anti-inflammatory functions of CeO 2 @RSV NPs     Materials and methods   Synthesis of the nanocomposite   Preparation of CeO 2 @RSV  CeO 2 was prepared by a hydrothermal process, which was performed as previously described [ 31 ]. In brief, 0.1\u00a0mol Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (Siga, USA) and 0.01\u00a0mol Na 3 PO 4 \u00b712H 2 O were dissolved in 10\u00a0mL and 30\u00a0mL of deionized water, respectively. Then, the two solutions were mixed in a Teflon container under a magnetic stirrer for 1\u00a0h and subsequently reacted for 12\u00a0h at 170\u00a0\u00b0C in a temperature-controlled electric oven (DGG-9070BD, Shenxin, Shanghai, China). The above products were washed and then dried at 50\u00a0\u00b0C in an oven.  Afterward, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was applied to prepare amino-functionalized CeO 2 [ 32 ]. One milliliter of APTES was added to the aforementioned prepared 40\u00a0mg nanoparticles dispersed with 20\u00a0mL of absolute isopropyl ethanol and stirred vigorously for 6\u00a0h at 85\u00a0\u00b0C. A schematic image of the chemical bonding between RSV and APTES is depicted in Additional file 1 : Fig. S1. Subsequently, different concentrations of RSV (5, 10, and 15\u00a0mg) were added to the amino-functionalized CeO 2 @APTES (40\u00a0mg) and dispersed into 20\u00a0mL ethanol, followed by mixing for 24\u00a0h. The final CeO 2 @RSV product was centrifuged at 9500\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min and dried at 50\u00a0\u00b0C in an oven overnight.    Characterization of synthesized nanocomposites  The morphology and structure of the NPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H-8100IV, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-IT300, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). XRD (Empyrean, PANalytical B.V. Netherlands) was used to examine the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles by comparison with the standard XRD profile of CeO 2 , and the contents of Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ were determined by XPS (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The zeta potential was determined using a zeta potential instrument (Zetasizer, Nano-Z, Malvern Instruments Limited, UK). AIR-FTIR (VERTEX 70, Bruker, Germany) was used to measure functionalized CeO 2 with a Bruker Vertex 80\u00a0V spectrometer. The size distribution of the nanoparticles was determined by DLS (Zetasizer Nano-ZS ZEN3700, Malvern Instruments Limited, UK). An Avance III HD 400\u00a0MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker-BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) was used to confirm the chemical bonding between RSV and APTES.    Drug loading efficiency (LE) and encapsulation efficiency (EE)  To determine the drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, the prepared drug-loaded NPs were analyzed by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 372\u00a0nm. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were calculated using the following equations. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Drug}}\\;{\\text{loading}}\\;{\\text{efficiency}}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left( {{\\text{total}}\\;{\\text{drug}}-{\\text{free}}\\;{\\text{drug}}} \\right)/{\\text{weight}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{nanocomposites}} \\times 100\\% ,$$\\end{document} Drug  loading  efficiency % = total  drug - free  drug / weight  of  nanocomposites \u00d7 100 % ,  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Encapsulation}}\\;{\\text{efficiency}}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left( {{\\text{total}}\\;{\\text{drug}}-{\\text{free}}\\;{\\text{drug}}} \\right)/{\\text{total}}\\;{\\text{drug}} \\times 100\\% .$$\\end{document} Encapsulation  efficiency % = total  drug - free  drug / total  drug \u00d7 100 % .      Patients and tissue samples  The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Ethical Approval Number WDRY 2019-K077), and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Human primary ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) were collected from patients at the Reproductive Center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. PCOS patients (n\u2009=\u200910) were diagnosed according to the 2003 Rotterdam Criteria [ 33 ]. The baseline characteristics of the patients are described in Additional file 1 : Table S1.  GCs were obtained from PCOS patients who had undergone oocyte retrieval with a long stimulation protocol and isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, the follicular fluid was centrifuged at 300\u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was suspended in PBS (Servicebio, China), 50% Percoll (Biosharp, Wuhan) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1800\u00a0r/min for 20\u00a0min. The middle white granulosa cell layer was aspirated and washed with PBS, and then the cells were seeded in a cell culture plate for further experiments.    Animal models and treatment   Animal models  Female C57BL/6 mice (3\u00a0weeks) received adaptive feeding for 1\u00a0week. The PCOS mouse model was constructed as previously described [ 34 ], and the mice were injected (s.c.) with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g/d in olive oil) daily for 21 consecutive days. This study was divided into five subgroups (n\u2009=\u20095/group): (1) sham group [olive oil, subcutaneous (s.c.)], (2) PCOS group, (3) CeO 2 group [mice injected with DHEA and treated with CeO 2 with the same amount of CeO 2 as CeO 2 @RSV], and (4) RSV group [mice injected with DHEA and treated with RSV with the identical amount of RSV as CeO 2 @RSV]. (5) CeO 2 +\u2009RSV group [mice injected with DHEA and treated with a mixture of RSV and CeO 2 ], and (6) CeO 2 @RSV group [mice injected with DHEA and treated with CeO 2 @RSV (1\u00a0mg/kg)]. For the JAK/STAT inhibitor (WP1066) study, mice were injected with DHEA and treated with CeO 2 @RSV+WP1066. All experimental groups were injected with the corresponding solution by the tail vein every other week. Then the mice were sacrificed by isoflurane anesthesia 2\u00a0weeks after the treatment. Blood samples were collected from the eyes of mice and then centrifuged and stored at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C for biochemical analyses and ELISA. All in vivo studies were performed under the approval of Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wuhan University (Ethical Approval Number 20190710).    In vivo fluorescence imaging  ICG-labeled NPs were synthesized as previously described [ 35 ]. In short, 40\u00a0mg CeO 2 NPs were added into 1\u00a0mL APTES (resuspended in absolute isopropyl ethanol solution), and an indocyanine green (ICG) solution (10\u00a0mg/mL, 1\u00a0mL) was added and stirred for 6\u00a0h. Twenty milliliters of 10\u00a0mg RSV ethanol solution was then added to the mixed solution and stirred for 24\u00a0h. ICG-labeled CeO 2 @RSV NPs (1\u00a0mg/kg) were intravenously injected into mice, and the mice were sacrificed 2\u00a0weeks after the injection. Fluorescence imaging was recorded by an IVIS Spectrum (Perkin Elmer, USA). Finally, the mice were killed, and the ovarian tissues were detected by IVIS Spectrum.     Cytocompatibility biocompatibility assay for CeO 2 @RSV  A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity of our NPs\u00a0in vitro. Cells were seeded at a density of 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 3 in a 96-well plate overnight and administered different concentrations of NPs for 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h. Then, 10\u00a0\u00b5l CCK-8 reagent was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. Cell viability was determined by using a microplate reader (Ensight, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States) at 450\u00a0nm. All CCK-8 tests were performed in triplicate and were repeated three times.  In vivo,\u00a0healthy C57BL/6 mice (n\u2009=\u20095) were intravenously administered NPs (1\u00a0mg/kg) as a bolus (100\u00a0\u03bcL) through the tail vein. After 2\u00a0weeks, the primary organs (including the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and ovary) were collected and fixed in formalin, followed by H&E staining and pathological analysis. The stained tissue samples were observed under a microscope (Olympus BX53) at a magnification of 200\u00d7.    Cell culture and treatment   Cell culture  The human ovarian granulosa cell line (KGN cells) was acquired from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, the primary ovarian granule cells (GCs) obtained from PCOS patients were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, China), and the human monocyte cell line THP-1 was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 .    Effect of nanocomposites on immunoregulation via macrophage polarization in vitro  Based on the cytotoxicity tests of the different concentrations of CeO 2 @RSV (10, 50, and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), the concentration of 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NPs was suitable and used in the subsequent experiments.  THP-1 cells were incubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma, 16561-29-8, USA) for 24\u00a0h to differentiate into M0 macrophages. To investigate the impact of NPs on the repolarization of M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were cultured with 100\u00a0ng/mL LPS (Sigma, L4391, USA) plus 20\u00a0ng/mL IFN-\u03b3 (PeproTech, 300-02, USA) to induce the M1 phenotype. Similarly, a concentration of 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of prepared NPs was added to M1 macrophages according to the CCK8 results of the macrophages. After incubation for 48\u00a0h, the supernatant was centrifuged at 2000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min, and the cells and supernatant were collected for further analysis. For inhibition of signaling pathways, macrophages were pretreated with 5\u00a0\u00b5M WP1066 (MCE, China), 10\u00a0\u00b5M BAY11-7082, 100\u00a0nM VX-11e or 10\u00a0\u00b5M SB 239063 for 12\u00a0h before further experiments.    Coculture model system  To investigate how macrophage polarization affects the proliferation and apoptosis of KGN cells in vitro. A cell coculture model system was used, wherein NP-treated M1 macrophages were added to the upper chamber of a Transwell chamber system, and KGN cells were placed in the lower chamber. Then, the cells were evaluated after coculturing for 48\u00a0h.     Flow cytometry  Fresh mouse spleens were acquired and ground and then filtered with a strainer, and a red blood cell lysis solution (Servicebio, China) was added to lyse the red blood cells. Ground spleen-derived cells or GC cells in different treatment groups were separated in 200\u00a0\u03bcL of transcription factor buffer (BD Pharmingen), and the corresponding antibodies were incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. For apoptosis analysis, an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (ABclonal, China) was used to stain cells at room temperature for 15\u00a0min in the dark. Next, the cells were washed with PBS, and flow cytometry analysis was performed using a Beckman CytoFLEX flow cytometer. The data were analyzed with Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR USA).    Histological assessment  Tissues\u00a0were\u00a0fixated in 4% formaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Then, the sections were cut at a thickness of 5 \u2009\u03bcm for\u00a0hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and dehydrated by graduated ethanol, and the sections were sealed with neutral resin. Representative tissue sections were imaged under a light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).    Immunofluorescence  After fixation with 4% formaldehyde, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies against iNOS or CD206 (Affinity, Cat. No. DF4149 and AF0199,\u00a0dilution 1:500) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The corresponding secondary antibodies\u00a0(1:200) were applied for 2\u00a0h, and the nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Servicebio, China). The results were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).    Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Accurate Biology, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was conducted with the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Accurate). PCR was performed by using a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The relative gene expression levels reported in this study were analyzed with the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394 Ct method. The primers used to measure mRNA expression levels are shown in Additional file 1 : Table S2.    Western blot analysis  Proteins were extracted from tissues and cells with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked in 5% BSA, and subsequently primary antibodies against actin (ABclonal, Cat. No. A17910), Bcl2, Bax (Proteintech, Cat. No. 68103-1-Ig, 60267-1-Ig), STAT3 (Proteintech, China, No. 10253-2-AP), p-STAT3 (Affinity, China, Cat. No. AF3293), NF-\u03baB, p-NF-\u03baB (Cell Signaling, USA, Cat No. 8242, 3303), Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling, Cat No. 4696, 4376), p38 MAPK, and p-MAPK (Cell Signaling, Cat No. 8690, 4511) were incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abmart, Cat. No. T55756F) were utilized, and the membranes were visualized using a chemiluminescence western detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed by ImageJ.    Measurement of serum biochemical markers  After collecting the supernatants of the mice, the levels of different biochemical markers [testosterone (T), estradiol (E 2 ), luteinizing hormone (LH), IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10] were measured by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was measured by tail vein blood sampling using a blood glucose meter (ONETOUCH Ultra Vue, China). Blood glucose levels were measured after fasting and then administered glucose (2\u00a0g/kg body weight). The glucose uptake ability and the level of lactic acid were evaluated by using a lactic acid determination kit (A019-2-1, Nanjing Jiancheng) and glucose determination kit (A154-1-1, Nanjing Jiancheng) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.    Malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) tests  MDA (A003-1, Jiancheng, Nanjing), CAT (S0051, Beyotime) and SOD (A001-3, Jiancheng, Nanjing) assay kits were used to assess the levels of MDA, CAT and SOD. Then, the corresponding solutions were added to the working solution following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.    ABTS free radical scavenging assay  An ABTS scavenging assay was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of NPs according to the corresponding instructions (SO121, Beyotime). The different NP samples (10\u00a0\u03bcL) were mixed with peroxidase working solution (20\u00a0\u03bcL)\u2009+\u2009ABTS working fluid (170\u00a0\u03bcL) and then examined at 734\u00a0nm absorbance.    Measurement of intracellular ROS levels  The cellular ROS levels were evaluated with 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as previously described [ 36 ]. Briefly, the treated KGN cells were suspended in 1\u00a0mL of serum-free medium supplemented with 1\u00a0\u03bcL of the oxidative fluorescent dye DCFH-DA (S0033, Beyotime) for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Finally, the intensity of the DCFDA signal in the cells was detected by flow cytometry.    EdU and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay  The proliferation of KGN cells was assessed using an EdU cell proliferation kit (C0078S, Beyotime, China). After treatment, serum-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 1:1000 EdU was incubated for 2\u00a0h. The apoptosis of ovarian tissues was assessed using a TUNEL apoptosis assay kit (C1086, Beyotime, China). The cells and ovarian paraffin sections were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1\u00a0h and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5\u00a0min. Then, the cells and paraffin sections were incubated with the TUNEL working solution in the dark for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Three randomly selected fields in each sample were observed, and the percentage of positive cells was calculated.    RNA sequencing  RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of CeO 2 @RSV. Briefly, PMA-induced M0 macrophages were seeded in 6\u00a0cm plates at a density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 cells/well, and then 100\u00a0ng/mL LPS plus 20\u00a0ng/mL IFN-\u03b3 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL CeO 2 @RSV were cultured for 48\u00a0h. TRIzol reagent was used to collect the total RNA, and the gene expression level was analyzed by Wekemo Technologies (Shenzhen, China). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Wekemo BioinCloud ( https://bioincloud.tech/ ).    Statistics  All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 6 software. The results are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Paired t tests were used when only two groups were compared. Evaluation of significance was performed using one-way ANOVA when more than two groups were compared. P <\u20090.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.     Results   Characteristics of prepared NPs  Octahedral CeO 2 was functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to form Si\u2013O bonds, followed by chemical bonding of RSV to CeO 2 through acidic hydroxyl groups of resveratrol replacing the ethoxy groups provided by APTES, finally obtaining CeO 2 @RSV NPs. A schematic of the chemical bonding between RSV and APTES is shown in Fig. 1 A. Different concentrations of RSV (5, 10, and 15\u00a0mg) were attached to CeO 2 @APTES (40\u00a0mg) by mixing for 24\u00a0h. According to the LE and EE results of the synthesized CeO 2 @RSV NPs, we found that 10\u00a0mg RSV obtained appropriate LE and EE levels and was selected for subsequent research (Additional file 1 : Fig. S2, Table S3). All NPs were octahedral in shape with a uniform particle size of approximately 100\u00a0nm, as determined by TEM and SEM (Fig. 1 B, C), and the average sizes of CeO 2 , CeO 2 @APTES and CeO 2 @RSV were 93, 105 and 120\u00a0nm, respectively (Additional file 1 : Fig. S3). The zeta potentials of the three kinds of NPs changed from +\u200924.1 to \u2212\u20095.6\u00a0mV, which was due to the modification of RSV, as RSV has a negative potential. (Fig. 1 D). The formation of the synthesized particles was further assessed by FTIR spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1 E, a peak at 1573\u00a0cm \u22121 was associated with the NH 2 group, which was attributed to the presence of APTES. The characteristic peak of stretching vibration at approximately 1660\u00a0cm \u22121 was found in CeO 2 @RSV, indicating the chemical bond between CeO 2 NPs and RSV. The corresponding EDX mapping images displayed the distribution of Ce, Si and C in the nanocomposites (Additional file 1 : Fig. S4). As shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, the characteristic peaks of the three NPs could be indexed to the ceria-based crystallographic structure (Additional file 1 : Fig. S5). These results demonstrated the successful functionalization of CeO 2 with APTES and RSV. Fig. 1 Characteristics of prepared NPs. A Schematic representation of the synthesis of CeO 2 @RSV. B SEM images of CeO 2 , CeO 2 @APTES and CeO 2 @RSV. C TEM images, D zeta potential, E FTIR, F SOD activity and G CAT activity of the indicated NPs. Data are shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. n\u2009=\u20093, * P <\u20090.05. Scale bar: 100\u00a0nm   Given that the electron transfer between Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ determines the nanozyme activity of CeO 2 [ 37 , 38 ], we then examined the proportion of Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ in the three NPs by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Additional file 1 : Fig. S6). The ratios of Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ in the three samples were 16.6%, 17.8% and 18.4%, respectively, and slight changes in the Ce 3+ concentration indicated the stable antioxidant activity of the nanoceria when combined with RSV. The SOD and CAT activity assays demonstrated that all NPs exhibited favorable antioxidant capacities, among which CeO 2 @RSV had the greatest antioxidant ability (Fig. 1 F, G). Furthermore, other probes (2,2\u2032-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS)), which are also commonly used in investigating antioxidant properties, were used [ 39 ], and Additional file 1 : Fig. S7 shows similar antioxidant efficiency of CeO 2 @RSV. Spectrophotometer analysis indicated that the drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies were 6.13% and 67.92%, respectively. Furthermore, the diameter and zeta potential exhibited minor fluctuations within 7\u00a0days (Additional file 1 : Fig. S8A, B), which confirmed the favorable stability of CeO 2 @RSV under physiological conditions.    CeO 2 @RSV manipulates the infiltration of macrophages and reduces the inflammatory response  Macrophage infiltration and macrophage-derived products are the main pathological factors in PCOS [ 14 , 40 ]. Before applying our constructed CeO 2 @RSV NPs, we first optimized the concentrations in vitro. The cytocompatibility of CeO 2 @RSV was detected by a CCK-8 assay to assess the viability of the macrophages (Additional file 1 : Fig. S9). We found that a dose of 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL resulted in relatively high cell viability and served as the optimal concentration for subsequent experiments. In addition, TEM revealed that CeO 2 @RSV was present in the cytoplasm of macrophages, suggesting the favorable uptake and biological activity of our synthesized NPs (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 CeO 2 @RSV manipulates the infiltration of macrophages and reduces the inflammatory response.

K Representative histograms and MFIs of DCF fluorescence in M1 macrophages treated with NPs. n\u2009=\u20093, * P <\u20090.05, ** P <\u20090.01, *** P <\u20090.001   We next investigated the immunoregulatory effect of CeO 2 @RSV on macrophage polarization. PMA-induced M0 macrophages were incubated with CeO 2 @RSV, and the results showed that CeO 2 @RSV markedly promoted the differentiation of M0 macrophages into M2 cells while decreasing their differentiation into M1 cells (Additional file 1 : Fig. S10). In addition, LPS\u2009+\u2009IFN-\u03b3 was added to M0 macrophages prior to NPs treatment (Fig. 2 B). The mRNA expression levels of M1 polarization markers (IL1-\u03b2, iNOS and TNF-\u03b1) were decreased compared with those in the control group, with the CeO 2 @RSV group exhibiting the most prominent effects (Fig. 2 C\u2013E), which indicated superior abilities owing to the synergistic effect of CeO 2 and RSV. TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10, indicating M2 markers, were upregulated in the CeO 2 @RSV group (Fig. 2 F, G). Immunofluorescence also indicated increasingly high levels of CD206 but diminished levels of iNOS in the CeO 2 @RSV group (Fig. 2 H). Furthermore, the level of proinflammatory IL1-\u03b2 was significantly suppressed in NPs-treated cells, and the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased most efficiently in the supernatant of CeO 2 @RSV-treated cells (Fig. 2 I). The flow cytometry results indicated the same trend (Fig. 2 J). The above results demonstrated that the CeO 2 @RSV we prepared could manipulate the M2 phenotype polarization of undifferentiated (M0) and differentiated (M1) macrophages and promote the anti-inflammatory effect of M2 macrophages; these changes in macrophage profiles are critical for remodeling the ovarian immune microenvironment.  It is known that macrophages produce excessive ROS when activated by diverse inflammatory stimuli [ 41 ], and oxidative stress may further exacerbate inflammatory reactions and arouse a vicious cycle [ 42 ]. In addition, CeO 2 @RSV NPs presented predominant SOD and CAT activity; therefore, we evaluated the effect of NPs on ROS production in inflammatory macrophages. As indicated in Fig. 2 K, macrophages pretreated with NPs exhibited distinctly reduced intracellular ROS levels, with minimum DHE fluorescence. Moreover, MDA and SOD, well-established markers of oxidative stress, were measured to assess antioxidative capacity. As expected, compared to all other groups, the CeO 2 @RSV group exhibited markedly increased SOD levels and decreased MDA levels (Additional file 1 : Fig. S11A, B). Collectively, these data suggest that CeO 2 @RSV NPs inhibit oxidative stress and increase the antioxidative ability of M1 macrophages.    CeO 2 @RSV-induced macrophage polarization promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in granulosa cells  The proliferation and apoptosis of GCs are thought to play essential roles in the pathogenesis of PCOS [ 43 ]. Recently, much attention has been given to the effect of macrophage polarization on the abilities of GCs, and the increased M1/M2 ratio suppresses GC proliferation in antral follicles [ 16 ]. Herein, granulosa cells and NPs-treated M1 macrophages were cocultured in a noncontact Transwell system to explore the effect of NPs-treated macrophage polarization on the proliferation and apoptosis of KGN cells (Fig. 3 A). The results of CCK-8 and EdU assays illustrated that the proliferation of KGN cells in the NPs-treated coculture group was augmented compared with that in the group in which KGN cells were cultured with M1 macrophages alone (Fig. 3 B, C). In the apoptotic pathway, the proapoptotic molecule Bax and the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl2 are the most important participants that effectively regulate the cell [ 44 ]. Hence, to corroborate the effects of NPs-treated M1 macrophages on KGN cells, we tested the changes in the levels of these genes. As expected, compared to all other groups, the CeO 2 @RSV coculture group exhibited a markedly increased Bcl2/Bax ratio (Fig. 3 D, E). Furthermore, the apoptosis of KGN cells in different groups was assessed using flow cytometry, and our results suggested that the apoptosis rate of KGN cells was dramatically decreased in the NPs-treated cocultured group compared with the M1 macrophage cocultured group (Fig. 3 F). Comparatively, CeO 2 @RSV yielded a more efficient effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of KGN cells than CeO 2 +\u2009RSV and CeO 2 alone. Furthermore, we observed analogous phenomena in human primary ovarian GCs pretreated with CeO 2 @RSV, such as a higher Bcl2/Bax ratio and a lower apoptosis rate (Additional file 1 : Fig. S12).

First, an animal long-term toxicity test was conducted to examine the biosafety of CeO 2 @RSV (1\u00a0mg/kg). Then, HE staining showed no histological variation between the treatment groups and the control group in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and ovary (Additional file 1 : Fig. S13). As shown in Additional file 1 : Fig. S14A, B, the PCOS model mice were intravenously injected with indocyanine green (ICG)-labelled CeO 2 @RSV NPs, and the abdomen was enriched with abundant nanoparticles. Furthermore, we witnessed an obvious accumulation of NPs in ovarian tissue, among which the CeO 2 @RSV group displayed prominent bioavailability.

The ELISA results showed that the level of the proinflammatory cytokine IL1-\u03b2 was decreased in all NPs-treated mice, and the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in the CeO 2 @RSV group compared with the PCOS model mice (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that inflammation was suppressed by NPs treatment and that CeO 2 @RSV exhibited the greatest effect. RT\u2012PCR analysis of the ovarian tissues also showed the same results (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, the M1/M2 ratio in the spleen of CeO 2 @RSV-treated mice was greatly decreased (Fig. 4 D), indicating that CeO 2 @RSV successfully altered the macrophage polarization state. Moreover, the apoptosis of ovarian GCs in PCOS mice was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 E, the TUNEL assay showed that NPs treatment was able to suppress the apoptosis of ovarian GCs in PCOS mice, among which the CeO 2 @RSV group contributed the most efficiently. Similarly, western blot analysis confirmed a consistent trend (Fig. 4 F). Overall, these results suggested that CeO 2 @RSV could effectively repolarize M1 macrophages into the M2 phenotype, alleviate the inflammatory response, and ameliorate GC apoptosis in the ovarian tissues of PCOS mice.    Effects of CeO 2 @RSV on ameliorating ovarian function and endocrine disorders in PCOS mice  Reportedly, ovarian dysfunction including endocrine, follicular growth and ovulation disorders, is an important characteristic of PCOS [ 46 ]. Given the excellent anti-inflammatory activity of CeO 2 @RSV, we then assessed its effects on ovarian function and endocrine disorders. As indicated in Fig. 5 A, PCOS mice exhibited abnormal estrous cycles, and this phenomenon was attenuated by NPs treatment. Examination of hormones showed that the serum levels of estradiol (E 2 ), testosterone (T) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were significantly higher in the PCOS group and subsequently decreased in all experimental groups, especially those treated with CeO 2 @RSV (Fig. 5 B\u2013D). In addition, the PCOS group showed the typical change in ovarian morphology, with a considerable number of cystic follicles (CF) and a relatively diminished number of corpora lutea (CL), and administration of NPs reversed these effects (Fig. 5 E\u2013G). According to the GTT results, PCOS mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, while treatment with NPs significantly suppressed glucose levels and the GTT area under the curve (AUC), and the CeO 2 @RSV group alleviated the levels most efficiently (Fig. 5 H, I). These data suggested that CeO 2 @RSV treatment ameliorated endocrine disorders and abnormal ovarian morphology and restored impaired glucose metabolism in DHEA-induced PCOS mice.

Volcano plots demonstrated that the genes were significantly different after treatment with CeO 2 @RSV (Fig. 6 A). As illustrated in Fig. 6 B, the clustered heatmap shows that treatment with CeO 2 @RSV had a suppressive effect on various proinflammatory genes, such as IL13A, TNF, IL-6, CCL2 and IL32. Notably, the expression of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes, including GPX8 and TGFBR1, was distinctively upregulated after CeO 2 @RSV treatment compared to that in the M1 macrophage group. GO enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes demonstrated significant changes in immune response, cytokine activity, and chemokine activity (Fig. 6 C). KEGG analysis identified significantly enriched pathways, and the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine\u2012cytokine receptor interaction, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway were strongly associated with the anti-inflammatory effects of CeO 2 @RSV (Fig. 6 D). To further investigate the specific pathway after CeO 2 @RSV treatment, western blot analysis was conducted and the results revealed that the phosphorylation of STAT, NF-\u03baB, Erk1/2 and MAPK was activated to varying degrees. Among them, p-STAT3/STAT3 was the most significant which suggested that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway played an important role.

In cell experiments, we found that a specific inhibitor of JAK (WP1066) reversed the effect of CeO 2 @RSV on macrophage polarization, with elevated levels of M1 phenotype markers and depressed levels of M2 phenotype markers (Fig. 7 A, B). Additionally, western blot analysis showed that after inhibiting JAK, STAT3 phosphorylation decreased (Fig. 7 C). At the same time, WP1066 inhibited the increased Bcl2/Bax expression and promoted the apoptosis of KGN cells after coculture with M1 macrophages (Fig. 7 D\u2013F). In animal experiments, PCOS mice were then administered CeO 2 @RSV\u2009+\u2009WP1066, and ELISA, western blotting, TUNEL and HE staining were performed. The results indicated that after inhibiting JAK, the serum level of IL-1\u03b2 was enhanced, but IL-10 was reduced (Fig. 7 G). The TUNEL assay showed that the apoptosis of ovarian tissues was increased when WP1066 was administered (Fig. 7 H). Furthermore, WP1066 treatment deteriorated ovarian function, which was improved by CeO 2 @RSV, with an increased number of CFs, a decreased number of CLs and deteriorated glucose tolerance (Fig. 7 I\u2013L). All of these results suggested that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a key signaling pathway in CeO 2 @RSV therapy for PCOS, which involves changes in the immune microenvironment, ovarian function, and glucose metabolism.

It is known that anti-inflammation is an important strategy in the treatment of PCOS syndromes [ 48 , 49 ]. Traditional agents for PCOS therapy (such as metformin and oral contraceptives) mainly alleviate a series of complications, have poor stability and cause severe side effects [ 50 , 51 ], and there is a need to develop novel treatment options. Macrophages are key mediators of the immune response in the ovarian immune microenvironment due to their considerable plasticity and versatile roles in response to external stimuli [ 52 ]. It has been well documented that aberrant macrophage polarization is critical for the maintenance of proinflammatory phenotypes during PCOS and accelerates the injury of ovarian tissues [ 53 ]. Therefore, rebalancing proinflammatory microenvironment agents would be beneficial for precise PCOS therapy.  Recently, CeO 2, with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, has attracted considerable attention and protects against numerous inflammation-related diseases, such as diabetic wounds, acute kidney injury and ischemic stroke [ 54 , 55 ]. However, no study has focused on the therapeutic effect of nanomaterials on PCOS, and current CeO 2 nanoparticles have been limited by their anti-inflammatory effects on the M2 phenotype. In the present study, we characterized a novel nanoparticle, CeO 2 @RSV, which was synthesized via chemical bonding of CeO 2 with traditional anti-inflammatory RSV, thus exhibiting satisfactory effects in the treatment of PCOS. Compared with traditional anti-inflammatory or natural enzymes, the chemically bonded nanozyme CeO 2 @RSV shows superior capability in eradicating the inflammatory response, scavenging excessive ROS and simultaneously exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. Our results demonstrated that CeO 2 @RSV possessed prominent SOD- and CAT-mimetic activities and has tremendous potential to protect cells from a variety of types of damage. Macrophages are the key regulators of GC proliferation, follicular development and ovulation [ 14 ], and the balance of the M1/M2 ratio determines the pathophysiology of PCOS [ 16 ]. After being taken up by macrophages, CeO 2 @RSV can efficiently manipulate the repolarization of macrophages, thereby reducing the proinflammatory M1 phenotype and enhancing the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, increasing evidence emphasizes the great potential of crosstalk between macrophages and granulosa cells in the physiological functions of ovaries [ 14 ]. Upon inflammatory stimulation, macrophage recruitment and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine release induce GC apoptosis and follicular atresia [ 56 ]. As expected, our results demonstrated that CeO 2 @RSV-mediated macrophage transformation promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells. Moreover, our results showed that CeO 2 @RSV treatment ameliorated endocrine disorders and abnormal ovarian morphology, and restored impaired glucose metabolism in DHEA-induced PCOS mice. Therefore, all the results suggest that alterations in the local microenvironment mediated by activated M1/M2 subtypes regulate the function of the ovary during PCOS.  Within the ovary, macrophage activities are involved in various aspects of ovarian function in PCOS pathogenesis [ 57 ]. ELISA and flow cytometry analysis revealed that treatment with CeO 2 @RSV dramatically decreased the number of proinflammatory macrophages in PCOS mice, which may contribute to the dampened proinflammatory microenvironment. RNA-seq data and further experiments indicated that several signaling pathways were related to the role of CeO 2 @RSV in macrophages, including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, of which the JAK-STAT signaling pathway exhibited the most marked effects. The enrichment analysis revealed that the immune response, cytokine activity, and chemokine activity are vital changes after CeO 2 @RSV treatment, which are significantly correlated with the improvement of PCOS. At the same time, the JAK/STAT pathway emerges as a major regulator of macrophage polarization that characteristically influences the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are vital for the development of inflammatory diseases [ 58 , 59 ]. Further explorations confirmed that the therapeutic abilities of CeO 2 @RSV could be inhibited by inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway in vitro and in vivo.    Conclusion  Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising approach that possesses high biocompatibility and drug delivery capabilities. The integration of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs and various functions of synthetic materials endow nanoparticles with widespread implications [ 60 ]. In our study, RSV was loaded with CeO 2 via chemical bonding to obtain the anti-inflammatory nanoparticle CeO 2 @RSV. CeO 2 @RSV nanoparticles preferentially suppress inflammation response-mediated injury and alleviate endocrine dysfunction, thereby reversing the pathological changes that occur during the development of PCOS. Overall, our study may elucidate the treatment and management of PCOS by using nanoparticles as potential therapeutics.     Supplementary Information   Additional file 1: Table S1.
