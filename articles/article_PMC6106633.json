    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinopathies among\nyoung women ( Knochenhauer et al .,\n1998 ). Chronic anovulation, clinical and laboratory evidence of\nhyperandrogenism, and ultrasound detection of micro polycystic ovaries ( Azziz et al ., 2009 )\ncharacterize it. It is a heterogeneous disorder of unclear etiopathogenesis but\nthere is evidence of the participation of a genetic component ( Xita et al ., 2002 ). Stein and Leventhal ( Z\u00e1rate-Trevi\u00f1o et al .,\n2014 ) are often credited with publishing the first paper describing PCOS,\nin 1935. Since their description of women with ovarian enlargement and absence of\nmenses more than 80 years ago, PCOS has garnered considerable attention and might be\nthe most common endocrine disorder, affecting up to 15% of all women in reproductive\nage, depending on the diagnostic criteria used ( Vignesh & Mohan, 2007 ).  Hyperandrogenism is the hallmark of PCOS. Clinically, we may see hirsutism, acne,\nandrogenic alopecia, and signs of virilization. Laboratory examination reveals\nincreased androgen levels ( Azziz et\nal ., 2009 ), which are associated with inhibition of follicle\ndevelopment, anovulation, menstrual changes, and microcysts in the ovaries ( Adams et al ., 1986 ; Lin et al ., 2013 ).  Hyperandrogenicity in connection with over nutrition has been shown to lead to\ncentral, 'visceral' obesity among PCOS patients ( Bj\u00f6rntorp, 1988 ; Kissebah et al ., 1982 ; Vague,\n1956 ), with an increase in circulating free fatty acids, and a reduction\nin insulin sensitivity and hepatic sex-hormone -binding-globulin (SHBG) production\n( Bj\u00f6rntorp, 1988 ; Kissebah et al ., 1982 ).\nLeptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, homocysteine, insulin resistance and other biochemical\nfactors may play a relevant role in some enigmatic reproductive disturbances such as\nPCOS ( Salehpour et al .,\n2008 ).  Metabolic disturbances are well-recognized clinical features of this syndrome.\nEspecially, dyslipidemia is a very common metabolic abnormality in women with PCOS,\nwith a prevalence of up to 70% ( Legro et\nal ., 2001 ). Insulin resistance is a key pathophysiological\ncomponent of PCOS, thus dyslipidemia in women with PCOS may be consistent with those\nfound in an insulin resistant state ( Kim & Choi,\n2013 ). In addition, a decrease in HDL-C and increase in TG levels are\nwell-known lipid profile characteristics in women with PCOS ( Brunzell & Ayyob, 2003 ; Dejager et al ., 2001 ; Yilmaz et al ., 2005 ).  Whatever the etiology of obesity, found in 50% of women with PCOS, weight loss is\nfrequently associated with correction of the hormonal abnormalities in PCOS and the\nreestablishment of regular ovulation ( Kiddy et al ., 1992 ; Ravn et al. , 2013 ). Weight loss is considered a\nfirst-line treatment in overweight women with PCOS ( Ravn et al ., 2013 ). Lifestyle changes improve the lipid\nprofile in PCOS patients, and may be used as a first-line management procedure for\novulation induction in these patients. Unfortunately, long-term success of lifestyle\nmodifications is not often achieved. Consequently, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop and validate appropriate pharmacological interventions to improve metabolic\nfunction in women with PCOS. Bozdag & Yildiz\n(2013) studied the lifestyle change interventions and medical approaches\nin the context of the management of metabolic alterations in PCOS. The authors\nconcluded that lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism\nand insulin resistance in women with PCOS, there was no evidence of effect on\nimproving glucose tolerance or lipid profile.  The use of pharmacological agents as adjunctive therapy for weight management is\nuniversally recommended by the most relevant clinical guidelines and consensus\ndocuments ( Wadden et al .,\n2005 ; National Institutes of Health, 1998; Coutinho & Cabral, 2000 ). Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug, which\npromotes weight loss by decreasing fat absorption from the intestine lumen by about\n30% ( Dixon, 2006 ; Padwal & Majumdar, 2007 ). Because weight loss is associated\nwith improvement in ovarian function in PCOS women, it seems that orlistat may\nincrease ovulation rate as well ( Ghandi et\nal ., 2011 ). Orlistat is currently the only lipase inhibitor\napproved for weight loss, and it is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic and gastric\nlipases, acting locally in the gut lumen with minimal absorption.  Orlistat, combined with lifestyle changes, induces substantial weight loss in women\nwith PCOS, resulting in improvements in insulin resistance, hyperandrogenemia and\ncardiovascular risk factors ( Panidis et\nal ., 2014 ; Vosnakis et al ., 2013 ). Vosnakis et al . (2013) demonstrated that in overweight\nand obese women with PCOS, orlistat administration (120 mg, 3 times per day) for 24\nweeks, combined with diet and physical exercise, for 24 weeks, resulted in\nsignificant weight loss, improvement of hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitivity,\nand increased serum AMH levels. Ghandi et\nal . (2011) in comparing the effects of metformin or orlistat\non hormone, lipid profile and ovulation status in obese women with polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, found that treatment with either drug caused a significant decline in body\nweight, BMI (Body Mass Index), and waist circumference, and the degree of decline in\nboth groups was the same. Patients who were treated with orlistat, showed a\nsignificant reduction in total testosterone and serum lipid.  The present study was designed to further investigate the effects of treatment with\norlistat, for a period of 12 weeks, on anthropometric features and serum androgen\nlevels in women with PCOS.    MATERIALS AND METHODS   Patients  The present study was approved by the ethics committee on Infertility and\nReproductive Health Research Center of the Taleghani Hospital, and it approved\nby the School of Medicine of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,\nTehran, Iran. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before\nenrolling in the study. The study followed the principles of the Declaration of\nHelsinki.  The patients were recruited from the gynecology outpatient clinic, between\nDecember 2012 and November 2013. The study included thirty-two women who met all\nof the following conditions: diagnosed to have PCOS, aged between 19 and 44\nyears, and BMI \u226525kg/m 2 . The diagnosis of PCOS was made\naccording to the revised 2003 European Society for Human Reproduction and\nEmbryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM) Rotterdam\nCriteria ( Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM- sponsored PCOS\nconsensus workshop Group, 2004 ), with the presence of at least two of\nthe following three features after exclusion of other etiologies: oligo-or\nanovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism and ultrasound finding\nof polycystic ovaries (presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring\n2-9 millimeter in diameter, and/or increased ovarian volume (>10ml). The\nsonography device used was the Esaote MyLab XVision 70 (Esaote, Italy).  Exclusion criteria were: non classical form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency,\nhyperprolactinemia, Cushing syndrome, androgen excess hormone tumors, orlistat\ncomplications during consumption and any sensitivity, chronic malabsorption\ndisease, cholestasis, renal or hepatic impairment, presence of impaired fasting\nglycemia, untreated hypothyroidism, current pregnancy or on breastfeeding,\nhaving any disease other than PCOS, any history of medication in the past 6\nmonths (like metformin, amiodarone, cyclosporine, warfarin) and severe Vit-D\ndeficiency.    Study Design  The patients' visits were scheduled according to menstrual cycle, during the\nfollicular phase, and for those with anovulatory cycles, in the amenorrhea\nphase. At the initial evaluation (baseline), the basal metabolic rate (in\nkcal/d) of all women was calculated and adjusted for moderate daily physical\nactivity as follow: in women 18-30 years of age: (0.0621 \u00d7 weight in kg +\n2.0357) \u00d7 240 \u00d7 1.3 and, in women >31 years of age: (0.0342\n\u00d7 weight in kg + 3.5377) \u00d7 240 \u00d7 1.3.  A dose of 120mg orlistat was taken three times daily and the dose remained\nconstant throughout the study period.  The subjects were weighed in kilograms using a digital scale, wearing light\nclothes and no shoes, at 9:00 AM (after an overnight fast), at baseline and at\nweek 12 after treatment onset. Their height was measured in centimeters using a\nwall-mounted measuring tape.  BMI was calculated using this formula: weight (kg)/height (m 2 ). Waist\nand hip circumferences were measured in duplicate in the supine position, and\ntheir ratio (WHR) was calculated.  Blood samples were collected, and the basal serum levels of FSH, LH, PRL, total\nand free testosterone levels, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS),\n17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (17\u03b1-OHP) and sex hormone-binding globulin\n(SHBG) were measured. Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed at\nrandom and at the end of the 3-months treatment period.    Laboratory Measurements  After 12 hours of overnight fasting, a blood sample was drawn from the\nantecubital region and into vacationer tubes. The sample was maintained at 4\u00b0C\nfor \u22642 hours before centrifugation. Serum aliquots were frozen at -80\u00b0C\nfor subsequent analyses. Fasting serum glucose, triglycerides (TG), total\ncholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric\nmethod (PishtazTeb Inc., Tehran, Iran), by a Hitachi auto-analyzer (Tokyo,\nJapan). In all the biochemical analyses, the intra-assay coefficients of\nvariation (CVs) were less than 2.0%.  Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and\nluteinizing hormone (LH), as well as prolactin hormone (PRL) were measured by a\nMicro plate Immunoenzymometric assay (IEMA/ELISA), using Monobind Inc. kits\n(Lake Forest, CA, USA).  We used the micro plate immunoenzymometric assay for determining 17\u03b1-OHP,\ntotal and free testosterone, as well as DHEAS using Accu-Bind kits, Monobind\nInc. (Lake Forest, CA, USA).  SHBG was determined in an Enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) using IBL INTERNATIONAL GMBH\nkites (Hamburg, Germany).  Q Sure TM [Quality Control Sera, MULTI LIGAND CONTROL-TRI LEVEL] was\nused as a quality control material to assist in the assessment of precision in\nthe clinical laboratory, from Monobind Inc. (Lake Forest, CA, USA).    Statistical analysis  For statistical analysis, we used the SPSS for windows version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) software package. The categorical data was studied using\nfrequency analysis. Clinical characteristics were compared by parametric or\nnon-parametric tests for independent samples, as appropriate. The data is\npresented as percentage, mean\u00b1SD, or median (range). In this study, p <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical\nsignificance.     RESULTS  The present study included 32 women with PCOS. The mean age was 27.75\u00b16.22 and\nthe mean body mass index was 32.69\u00b10.94 kg/m 2 . All subjects\ncompleted the three-month study. Two patients showed cramping and oily stool during\nthe first 2 weeks of treatment but it was not necessary to stop treatment or reduce\nthe drug dosage.  Demographic and clinical characteristics of the PCOs patients are presented in Table 1 .

Lipid profile changes after orlistat\nincluded significant increase in HDL levels. Conversely, orlistat had no effect on\nother lipid profiles.    DISCUSSION  It has been shown that treatment with orlistat is effective for amelioration of the\nPCOS hormonal and metabolic consequences for women ( Metwally et al ., 2009 ; Lord et al ., 2003 ; De\nSloover Koch & Ernst, 2001 ). Therefore, we studied the effect of\norlistat, as an anti-obesity drug, on hormonal and androgen level statuses in obese\nPCOS patients. This study is the second study among Iranian patients, which assessed\nthe effects of this drug on androgen levels among PCOS patients. The first study was\ncarried out by Ghandi et al .\n(2011) .  In the present study, treatment with orlistat reduced serum testosterone levels. This\nfinding is consistent with previous studies, in which orlistat therapy decreased\nserum testosterone levels ( Panidis et\nal ., 2014 ; Vosnakis et al ., 2013 ; Lord et al ., 2003 ; Sharpe\n& Franks, 2002 ). Nevertheless, in some studies orlistat reduced\nweight and waist circumference but did not affect testosterone levels ( Agarwal et al ., 2010 ).  In the present study, treatment with orlistat caused a significant reduction in body\nweight and BMI. Our study results were in agreement with those from the Panidis et al. (2014) study.\nThey reported that orlistat combined with lifestyle changes induces substantial\nweight loss in women with PCOS, resulting in improvements in hyperandrogenemia.\nOrlistat is a weight-loss drug with minimal systemic absorption ( Padwal & Majumdar, 2007 ), and therefore any\neffect of this drug is a result of weight loss and not a direct effect on\novaries.  The treatment with orlistat in this study resulted in a significant increase in HDL,\nbut no significant reduction in serum cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL, so it is\nnot in agreement with other studies in which orlistat improved other lipoproteins in\nthe lipid profile ( Lord et al .,\n2003 ; Metwally et al. ,\n2009 ). In a study by Ghandi et\nal . (2011) , treatment with orlistat resulted in a\nsignificant decline in total serum cholesterol and triglycerides.  Weight reduction in PCOS has been reported to improve hyperinsulinemia ( Huber-Buchholz et al ., 1999 ; Andersen et al ., 1995 ; Hamilton-Fairley et al .,\n1993 ), and reduce serum LH levels ( Poretsky et al ., 1999 ). Moreover, orlistat affects\ninsulin levels indirectly through weight reduction. In the present study, orlistat\nhad no statistically significant effect on fasting insulin and LH levels. It seems\nthat longer treatment with orlistat is needed to reach a significant reduction in\nserum LH level.  PCOS is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation, mainly attributable to the\nbuild-up of visceral fat, although an insulin resistance effect cannot be excluded\n( Repaci et al ., 2011 ).\nThe impact of hyperandrogenemia can be related to the influence of androgens on\nadipose tissue development and distribution. In addition, through the impact on the\nregulation of the synthesis and secretion of androgens in the ovary and in the\nadrenal gland, the state of low-grade inflammation also seems able to contribute to\nmaintain the syndrome ( Duleba, 2012 ).\nOrlistat consistently improves lipid profile and markers of systemic inflammation\n( Duleba, 2012 ).  In our study, Orlistat showed a significant HDL increasing effect. These increasing\nlevels of HDL might be attributable to a strong protection against cardiovascular\ndisease in the future for PCOS patients.  A shortcoming of the present study was its relatively low number of participants,\nwhich might have led to some of the relations not reaching a significance level.\nFurther studies with higher number of samples are recommended.  In conclusion, this study showed a significant reduction in weight and total\ntestosterone level, as the most important androgen, in polycystic ovary syndrome\npatients after 12 weeks of treatment with Orlistat. Therefore, it seems that a short\ncourse of Orlistat can be useful in the management of patients with polycystic ovary\nsyndrome.",
