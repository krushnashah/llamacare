    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder and metabolic\nheterogeneity in women of childbearing age. It involves various factors involved\ninfluenced by environmental factors such as eating habits, lifestyle, and social\nstatus ( Beydoun et al .,\n2009 ). The most important feature of this disorder is the presence of large\novaries containing a large number of small cysts that are located in the outer layer\nof each ovary. In this syndrome, the levels of female hormones (such as estrogen,\nprogesterone) become unbalanced and cause an increase in male hormones (androgens)\nand insulin. This causes symptoms such as menstrual irregularities, hair loss, acne,\ninfertility, and obesity ( Goodarzi et\nal ., 2012 ; Wang et\nal ., 2011 ).  Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of PCOS varies from 2.2-26% in\ndifferent countries ( March et al .,\n2010 ; Tehrani et al .,\n2011 ). In Brazil, the prevalence of PCOS in women aged 18-45 years was\nestimated at 8.5% ( Gabrielli & Aquino,\n2012 ) and in Italy in adolescents aged 18 years 32% ( Franceschi et al ., 2010 ).\nVarious treatments have been proposed for polycystic ovary syndrome; such as\nlifestyle changes, surgery, and the use of chemical drugs that today the use of\nmedicinal plants, has been significantly considered by researchers due to the side\neffects and risks of chemical drugs, especially in mothers of childbearing age\n( Ortmann et al ., 2002 ).\nPomegranate is one of the fruits that is widely consumed all over the world and has\nbeen of considerable importance in the pharmaceutical and food industries.  Pomegranate is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub or small Asian tree with the\nscientific name of Punica granatum, which reaches a height of 5 to 8 meters. This\nplant is native to Iran and northern India and has long been cultivated in the\nMediterranean region. This plant is currently widely cultivated throughout Armenia,\nIran, India, South Asia, East India, and tropical Africa. Pomegranate is a\ndrought-tolerant plant that can grow in arid areas with the Mediterranean climate,\nwinter rainfall, or summer rainy climate. In Iran, pomegranates are grown mainly in\ndesert areas with hot and dry summers, scorching suns, relatively cold winters, and\nsalty soil and water; this wide range of adaptation is one of the desirable\ncharacteristics of pomegranate ecophysiology. Pomegranate fruit has a thin leathery\nskin that changes color from red to pinkish yellow. The kernels are edible and are\ncovered with a fleshy, transparent, and white to a red color called aryl with a\nsour-sweet taste. Pomegranate kernels make an average of 143-37 grams per kilogram\nof pomegranate fruit, kernels are rich in oil and about 12-18% of it is oil ( Radjabian et al ., 2008 ). The\npomegranate seed oil )PSO) contains a variety of fatty acids, about 80% of which are\n18-carbon fatty acids with three conjugated double bonds (punic acid). Studies have\nshown that ponic acid is physiologically much stronger than Conjugated linoleic acid\n)CLA( ( Mukherjee et al .,\n2002 ).  There are very few reports on the pharmacological effects of PSO. A study by Nikseresht et al . (2015) showed that PSO had a positive effect on the fertilization power of male rats. These\neffects can be helpful for infertility. PSO supplementation may reduce oxidative\nstress in sperm and increase the pregnancy rate in women. In one study, pomegranate\nseed extract probably played an important role in reducing postpartum hemorrhage in\nmice ( Hossein et al ., 2015 ).\nA grape seed extract has probably increased the number of ovarian follicles and the\nformation of corpus luteum in the polycystic ovary due to its antioxidant and\nanti-inflammatory properties ( Salmabadi et\nal ., 2017 ).  In a study by Arao et al .\n(2004) , the effect of punic acid-rich PSO on fat metabolism in\nhigh-cholesterol mice was investigated. The results showed that feeding mice with\nPSO significantly reduced the accumulation of triglycerides and monounsaturated\nfatty acids in their liver. PSO prevents breast cancer due to its phytoestrogens and\nis also used in medicinal products effective in preventing skin aging.  Pomegranate seed oil and juice is a synthetic antioxidant with carcinogenic\nproperties. For this reason, in recent years, much attention has been paid to the\nreplacement of natural antioxidants, especially in plant sources. Due to the lack of\ndata on the possible effect of pomegranate seed water and oil consumption on\npatients with polycystic ovary syndrome, this study aimed to investigate the effect\nof pomegranate seed oil on human health.    METHODS  A complete the databases searched for in those articles were \u201cGoogle Scholar\u201d, \u201cSID\u201d,\n\u201cScopus\u201d, \u201cPubMed\u201d, \u201cScience Direct\u201d, and \u201cISI\u201d search engines. The search was done\nfor articles published that included the search the effect of pomegranate seed oil\non human health in their title. This study focused on published articles papers from\n1985 to 2021.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Lipids and their types  Lipids are a wide range of substances that are generally soluble in organic\nsolvents and insoluble in water. The terms fat and oil are two functional\nequivalents for lipids that are sometimes used interchangeably. But in general,\nfat can be considered a type of lipid that is solid at room temperature, while\nthe term oil is used for liquid lipids at room temperature ( Nichols & Sanderson, 2002 ). In the\nhuman body, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are synthesized from\nacetyl coenzyme A or obtained from diets. In contrast, some fatty acids, such as\nlinoleic acid and linolenic acid, are not synthesized by humans due to a lack of\nnecessary enzymes and must be supplied through food, which is why these\ncompounds are called essential fatty acids (EFA). These fatty acids are part of\nomega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which make up one-third of intracellular fatty\nacids. Essential fatty acids are also involved in the structure of\nphospholipids, which play a role in cellular structure, and when phospholipids\nare deficient, energy metabolism is disrupted. Essential fatty acids also lower\ncholesterol, so their presence or the ratio of essential fatty acids to\nsaturated fatty acids is a factor in lowering blood cholesterol ( Sikorski & Kolakowska, 2002 ). A proper\nbalance between the number of lipids in the diet and its nutritional quality is\nvery important in maintaining human health. Today, it has been proven that some\nfats and oils in the human body have beneficial properties and in addition to\nhaving nutritional value, they can also have positive effects on human health.\nThese compounds are called functional Lipid, Nutritional Lipid, It is called\nMedical Lipid or Pharmaceutical Lipid. For this reason, the food industry,\nconsidering the increasing awareness of people about nutrition and health\nissues, is trying to introduce such products to the consumer and meet the needs\nof the market by producing such products ( Adhikari et al ., 2010 ).    Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLN)  A conjugated linolenic acid is a group of geometric and positional isomers of\nlinolenic acid in which double bonds are conjugated. CLN isomers are found in\nthe oils of certain plant seeds and often as the major fatty acid.  So far, seven CLN isomers have been identified, including Eleostearic Acid\n(ESA-\u03b1) in Bitter Melon seed oil, Punicic Acid (PA) in pomegranate seed\noil, Catalpic Acid in Jacaric Acid seed oil, and Jacaranda mimosifolia in\npomegranate seed oil ( Adhikari et\nal ., 2010 ).    Effects of CLN on human health   The effect of pomegranate seed oil on polycystic ovary syndrome  PCOS is the most common endocrine or endocrine disorder in women and the\ncause of infertility due to ovulation, which affects different aspects of\npeople\u2019s lives due to different symptoms. This syndrome occurs in 10-15% of\ngirls and women. Manifestations of this syndrome include hirsutism,\nhyperandrogenism, acne, endometrial thinning, menstrual disorders, and\nobesity ( Makker et al .,\n2012 ; Moradi & Darvishi,\n2009 ; Yildirim et\nal ., 2003 ).  In recent years, many studies were done on the use of herbal medicines in the\ntreatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. Changes in sex hormone levels are\nimportant in polycystic ovary syndrome, and serum concentrations of\ntestosterone and androstenedione are 50 to 150% higher in women with PCOS\nthan in normal women ( Attarzadeh et\nal ., 2012 ). In a study by Hossein et al . (2015) the use of\npomegranate extract improved changes in female sex hormones in patients with\nPCOS. Therefore, it was suggested that this extract be used to reduce the\nsymptoms of PCOS.  Esmaeilinezhad et al .\n(2019) examined the effect of synbiotic pomegranate juice on\nblood glucose indices, sex hormone profile, and anthropometric indices in\npolycystic ovary syndrome, the results showed that testosterone levels, BMI,\nand weight were significantly reduced. Shamsi et al . (2016) showed that Glycyrrhiza\nglabra extract reduces serum levels of testosterone and estrogen in the\nstudy of the effect of glycyrrhizic acid on ovarian tissue follicles in mice\nwith polycystic ovaries.  Serological changes of curcumin were also observed in the form of increased\nFSH and progesterone, decreased LH, estradiol, and testosterone ( Nabiuni et al ., 2015 )\nby 18% and 23% (and reduced progesterone ( Mokhtari et al ., 2014 ). Phenolic compounds\nsimilar to pomegranate extract show positive effects in improving the\ncomplications of PCOS ( Milewicz et\nal ., 1993 ). Evaluation of the role of possible\nimprovement of pomegranate juice extracts on endometrial damage in a rat\nmodel with endometrial histological changes through antioxidant,\nanti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects, due to its polyphenol content\n( Ibrahim et al .,\n2021 ). Study by Fozalaee et al . (2015) and Pahlevani et al . (2016) examined the\neffect of fennel extract and Stachys lavandulifolia on uterine tissue\nstructure in mice with PCOS, respectively. Kouchesfahani et al . (2010) in a study showed\nthat honey bee venom with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in\npolycystic ovary affected rats increased the number of small follicles and\nthe appearance of corpus luteum in the ovary.  Free radicals are responsible for membrane lipid peroxidation, decreased\nsperm motility, and sperm inability to fertilize eggs ( Gil-Guzman et al ., 2001 ). Pomegranate\njuice contains vitamins C and E, which play an important role in targeting\nfree radicals ( S\u00f6nmez et\nal ., 2005 ; 2007 ). The effect of pomegranate extract on sperm parameters,\nfertility potential in mice, and improving sperm parameters are effective\nand its administration is recommended to improve the sperm status of\ninfertile men because it is herbal and available ( Amini Rad et al ., 2009 ).     Anti-cancer properties  According to reports, CLN has a very strong cytotoxic effect on tumor tissue\ncells in the body and prevents colon and skin cancer in mice and a rapid\nincrease in breast cancer cells in humans ( Eikani et al ., 2012 ). Kohno et al . (2004) fed rats with diets of\ndifferent concentrations of pomegranate seed oil, studied the effects of\nconjugated linolenic acid on the prevention of colon cancer and found that\npomegranate seed oil, due to its rich CLN fatty acid content, could Prevent the\nformation of colon cancer cells.    Anti-atherosclerosis  Arao et al . (2004) reported that linolenic acid affected on the indicated that by feeding a diet\nenriched with pomegranate seed oil in rats, they observed positive effects of\nponic acid on liver triglyceride levels.    Anti-atherosclerotic properties  Cardiovascular disease caused by high blood lipid levels is a very common problem\nthat has led to many deaths. Studies show that changing lifestyle habits such as\neating habits, exercising, and avoiding smoking can help prevent these diseases\n( Marcus et al .,\n1999 ; Ross, 2000 ). Diet plays a\nmajor role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, and extensive\nresearch on specific foods and components has shown that improving the incidence\nof serum lipids can reduce the incidence of these diseases ( Duthie & Brown, 1994 ; Kannel, 1985 ). Radjabian et al . (2008) showed that the\nprogression of atherosclerosis in the aorta of rabbits in the group treated with\npomegranate seed oil was significantly reduced compared to the control group. Mukherjee et al. (2002) examined the effect of different concentrations of Punicic\nAcid (0.6, 2.1, 4.2%) on laboratory mice. Finally, a significant reduction in\nplasma cholesterol and LDL levels was observed in the group treated with 2.4%\nPunicic Acid.    Conjugated Linoleic Acid  CLA is a general term for all positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid\nconjugated DNA. Linoleic acid, or 9-cis, 12-cis octoic acid, is an 18-carbon\ndouble-bonded fatty acid in positions 9 and 12. All known physiological effects\nof CLA are related to only the two major isomers of CLA, t11 and t10, c12. The\nmain sources of CLA are naturally ruminant animal fats. Milk and dairy products\nhave the highest amount of CLA. The CLA levels in some foods are shown in Table 1 . Among meat products, ruminant meat\nhas higher levels of CLA than non-ruminant meat. The highest amount of CLA in\nmeat products is found in mutton. Vegetable oils and margarine also contain a\nvery small amount of CLA (0.1-0.5 mg per gram of fat), which is the result of\nindustrial processes such as oil refining (especially the roasting step) and the\nhydrogenation process. In addition, CLA can be produced in oil due to high heat\nprocesses, for example, sunflower oil after use for frying contains 0.5 grams of\nCLA per 100 grams of oil ( Wahle et\nal ., 2004 ; Gn\u00e4dig et al ., 2003 ).   Table 1   Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) levels in some foods ( Wahle et al .,\n2004 ).

The first report on CLA\u2019s ability to reduce\nbody fat in a rat treatment was published in 1995. In that study, it was found\nthat using CLA at a rate of 0.5% in the diet reduces body fat and increases the\namount of protein and water. In 1999, it was discovered that this CLA effect was\nrelated to the isomers t10, c12 ( Wahle et al ., 2004 ; Park & Pariza, 2007 ). In another study, it was found that the\nsupplementation of CLA isomers (concentration of both isomers c9, t11 and t10,\nc12 in the mixture was 50%) by 3 grams per day, the plasma triglyceride\nconcentration is rapidly reduced. The ability of CLA to alter lipid metabolism\ndepends on factors such as increased lipolysis rate and fatty acid oxidation and\ndecreased cellular fatty acid uptake.  The effect of CLA on reducing body fat in humans was less than in mice, which\ncould be due to the following reasons: ( Franceschi et al ., 2010 ) The dose of CLA used in\nhumans was much lower than the dose used in mice. Mice were fed a diet\ncontaining (w / w) 0.5% CLA, which is equivalent to 56 grams of CLA per 70 kg\nindividual. While the dose of CLA for humans in various studies was between\n0.7-6.8 grams per day, which is much lower than the estimated 56 grams ( Goodarzi et al ., 2012 ).\nDifferent responses to CLA in humans and mice may be due to differences in their\nfat metabolism. In general, to accurately identify the mechanism of action of\nCLA in reducing body fat and its effects, more studies and research are\nneeded.    Antioxidant properties  Changing the profile of fatty acids in cancer cells and interfering with the\nproduction of eicosanoids.  The effect on the growth and increase of certain types of cancer cells and\nApoptosis ( Ha et al .,\n1990 ).    Anti-atherosclerotic property  Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of atherosclerosis. LDL oxidation is a\nwell-known mechanism in this regard. Evidence suggests that the disease can be\ncured or controlled with antioxidants. As mentioned, the antioxidant properties\nof CLA have been proven in many studies ( Flintoff-Dye & Omaye, 2005 ). Kostogrys & Pisulewski (2010) investigated the effect of CLA oil\non a high-fructose diet in Wistar rats and concluded that CLA in this type of\ndiet reduces plasma triglycerides and LDL.",
