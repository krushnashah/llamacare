Hence, we aimed to develop two separate, simple, reliable, validated, and easily interpretable HRQoL questionnaires in Arabic for married and unmarried women with PCOS for effective QoL evaluation. Materials and methods The development and reliability analysis of the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Quality of Life (PCOSQoL)-47 and PCOSQoL-42 involved two quantitative and qualitative phases. Phase 1 included retrieval of\u00a0158 items from 584 PubMed articles, item reduction, Arabic translation, content\u00a0and face validity testing, creation of a five-domain draft (53 items for\u00a0married and 45 items for unmarried women), with no sexuality domain for unmarried women. Phase 2\u00a0involved test-retest reliability, which involved using the Spearman's correlation, Wilcoxon nonparametric signed-rank, and internal consistency using Cronbach's-alpha, inter-item, and intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients, as well as creating a second draft (47 items for\u00a0married and 42 items for unmarried women). Results The content validity indices testing by 26 healthcare experts decreased the item pool to 57 items for married and 45 items for unmarried women. Face validity by another 30 experts and 30 women from each group resulted in a further reduction to 53 items for married and 45 items for unmarried women, to be tested in a pilot study, which included another 30 women from each group. Test-retest reliability analysis by 195 married and 173 unmarried women\u00a0revealed significantly excellent redundancy, reliability, and stability of items (highly significant Cronbach's alpha and ICC by internal consistency testing), and reduced the item pool to 47 items for\u00a0married and 42 items for unmarried women. Conclusions Both questionnaires were found to be highly reliable for the HRQoL evaluation among both\u00a0married and unmarried Arabic women with different phenotypes of PCOS.",
    "body": "Introduction  The phenotypic heterogeneity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is broad and associated with significant adverse effects on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [ 1 ]. These effects often manifest as psychological and physical distress, and self-esteem misperception, due to the failure to conform to the idealized norms of women's aesthetic and optimal health standards [ 2 ].  The symptoms perception related to PCOS is often influenced and characterized by complex cultural systems of beliefs, values, and ideals of particular societies/communities [ 3 ]. Many authors have translated the HRQoL questionnaires containing\u00a0domains or items pertaining to individual sexuality to evaluate their populations [ 3 - 7 ], but they often fail to take into account the local community norms regarding sexual relationships in specific cultures, where sex may be confined to marriage and marital sex is the only legitimate sexual relationship allowed. According to Quranic instructions, any sexual relationships outside of marriage are frowned upon, and this view is zealously held in almost all predominantly Muslim communities. Consequently, many women in such communities\u00a0are quite reluctant to discuss sexuality publicly. They seem\u00a0to place great value on modesty and privacy and hold the view that questions related to sexuality are socially unacceptable [ 8 ], and such attitudes often prompt many women to be hesitant to respond to questionnaires that contain such queries and make the comparison between HRQoLs unreliable to some degree.  In view of this, we tried to develop two simple, reliable, validated, consistent, interpretable, and self-administered HRQoL questionnaires in Arabic, which were individualized for married and unmarried women with PCOS, to be used as an effective tool in assessing the HRQoL in these women, in order to facilitate further studies in this area among Arabic-speaking populations.    Materials and methods  This study passed three phases to evolve into the final drafts of the PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47. Phase 3,\u00a0which included the assessment of the validation of the two questionnaires, will be discussed in a separate paper.  Phase 1: Questionnaire items retrieval (November 2018-March 2019)  We reviewed the PubMed database for the terms \"polycystic\" and \"PCOS\", with \"quality of life\" in the article\u00a0titles, abstracts, and texts, among articles published till 2019 in the English language. We found 274\u00a0articles with these search terms. Another 310\u00a0articles were retrieved from the references sections of the original search articles after excluding duplications.  The authors reviewed these 584\u00a0articles to retrieve 158\u00a0possible HRQoL complaint-related items among women in different life domains. The authors added additional 32\u00a0items from their daily practice. These 190\u00a0items were reviewed for duplication and consistency through an item-reduction phase to be more representative and concise. This phase reduced the items to 82\u00a0items, which were agreed upon by the authors. A second item-reduction phase was performed to create an initial draft with a subset of a 67-item questionnaire for married women and a subset of a 52-item questionnaire for unmarried women with PCOS.  Translation of the Questionnaire Items to Arabic  The translation was done through two stages: the first stage of forwarding translation involved translating the items from the mother's native language (English) to the target (Arabic) language by three independent endocrinologists. The authors agreed that the final draft of the translation should be in a simple common language, with minimal use of the medical terms, and minimal changes to avoid confusion among the respondents of the questionnaires. The second stage involved the backward translation of the Arabic\u00a0draft to English\u00a0to check for any inconsistencies in the translation and assured each item's scientific contents individually. This stage was conducted by another three independent endocrinologists and an English linguistics expert.  Scale characteristics  The items' language format in both scales was put in either positive, negative, or mixed wording formats to elicit maximal responses. The maximal response scale constituted a 5-point Likert scale with easily understandable, comprehensible, and memorable options. The response time was proposed to be 15-30 minutes.  The Content Validity of the Items  We consulted 26 healthcare experts who were in direct contact with PCOS women in their daily practice to assess the content validity of the retrieved 67 items for married and 52 items for unmarried women separately. These experts included 11 gynecologists, six adult endocrinologists, six endocrine nurses, two dermatologists, and a psychiatrist. We adopted the content validity index (CVI) criteria of Lawshe (1975) [ 9 ], with its modification by Ayre\u00a0and Scally\u00a0(2014) [ 10 ]. Seventeen experts responded through different social media platforms, while the rest were directly interviewed.  A 4-point Likert scale was attached to each item to check whether the items were relevant to the concept, clearly understood, and simple to read. The CVI for each item was calculated according to the expert response, and only scores 3 and 4\u00a0were counted. We calculated the CVI for each item by dividing the number of experts who scored\u00a03 or 4 for\u00a0items by their total number. We accepted the items if the CVI was \u22650.65, which represented the lowest CVI as described by Ayre and Scally [ 10 ].  The next step was to test whether the items were essential to be asked in the context of PCOS, through the estimation of content validity ratio (CVR), which must be >0.37 for a total of 26 experts, as per Lawshe\u00a0[ 9 ]. To achieve that, we attached a 3-point Likert scale wherein 1 represented \"not necessary\", 2 indicated \"useful, but not necessary\", and 3 stood for \"essential or necessary\". We counted only the scores of 3 in the CVR estimation.  The number of agreed-on items among the 26 experts, which achieved the required CVI and CVR, were 45 for unmarried women, and 57\u00a0for married women.  Distribution of the items in different domains  The resultant items were distributed according to their presumed relation to each other in the two five-domains questionnaires with a different number of items per domain for the unmarried and married women with PCOS as PCOSQoL-45 and PCOSQoL-57, respectively (Tables 1 , 2 ). We tried to have uniform and homogenous domains with regard\u00a0to the item count, which was achieved for\u00a0PCOSQoL-57, but not for PCOSQoL-45 because the latter did not contain any queries about sexual life. The items across the domains had the same themes regardless of marital status, except for the items included in the sexual and fertility domain for the married women (Table 3 ).

The purpose was to identify irrelevant items that could distract participants' attention and may result in omissions or faulty responses. Face validity provided a better chance for the future participants to complete the requested tasks, identified any wording ambiguities in any item, and pointed out any unconnected or missed concepts. Face validity is a qualitative and quantitative step to analyze questionnaire reliability [ 11 , 12 ].  To measure the impact score of the preliminary importance of the items as a measure for HRQoL, we attached a 5-point Likert scale for each item. We selected only those responses where the item was frequently perceived as important. The item impact score equals the frequency multiplied by the importance.\u00a0We accepted all items with an impact score of \u22651.5.  Implementation of\u00a0Face Validity Through Two Steps  The face validity was implemented through two steps. The first step involved 30 women with already diagnosed PCOS of different phenotypes from each group. We interviewed these women individually to obtain their opinion about the importance of the selected items. Each interview lasted about 15 minutes, and started with the question \u201cWhat does PCOS mean\u00a0to you?\u201d or \u201cDo you have any feeling regarding your diagnosis of PCOS?\u201d, or \u201cDid PCOS affect\u00a0your quality of life by any means?\u201d. The interviewer registered all those that looked important in the responses to be compared later with our preliminary list to see if it had any added value or new information. Then we gave each woman the specific numbered form and explained how to answer each item separately by encircling the score, which corresponds to its importance. After the completion, the authors asked for any further opinions about the items, to be written down or verbally registered.  The second step involved 30 healthcare professionals. They consisted of 10 adult endocrinologists, seven gynecologists, six endocrine nurses, three dermatologists, a psychiatrist, an internist, a family physician, and a gynecological radiologist. Twenty experts were approached through social media, and 10 experts responded in person. The same method described above was implemented for healthcare experts.  We ensured the anonymity of the responses during the whole process. Each form was encoded as a number that was known only to the first authors.  In conclusion, we excluded four items from the form meant for the married women who did not achieve the required item impact score of \u22651.5. The four excluded items included two items from the emotional and psychological domain (A11 and A12), one item from the body image domain (C12), and one item from the hair and acne domain (D12). No item was excluded from the form for the unmarried women (Table 4 ).

This step helped us primarily to re-arrange the items in the domains sequentially according to their total mean score, presumed importance, and necessity, maintaining the same theme of the content. The new codes for the questionnaires at this stage were PCOSQoL-45 for unmarried, and PCOSQoL-53 for married women with PCOS.  The second draft (Tables 5 , 6 )  The questionnaires were rearranged in a clear paper-pack format with five domains for each group of women with PCOS. Each item was attached with a 5-point Likert scale, where 1\u00a0denoted that the complaint item was \"always\" present, and (5) denoted that this complaint item was \"never\" perceived. The item scores in between correspond to the frequency of the women's complaint item in the last two weeks. The response was requested for each item accordingly. The respondent had the right to omit any item that they found irrelevant or embarrassing. On completion of the questionnaire, the overall score and the score for each domain were marked. The interviewer did the marking with anonymous record registration.  The questionnaires would be assessed through a psychometric validation process and statistical tests of reliability, including test-retest, internal consistency, and construct validity, to assess the questionnaire\u2019s acceptability, responsiveness, and interpretability in a specific population [ 12 ]. And to achieve that, we performed a real-world study of reliability testing.

Patients with any comorbidity not related to PCOS and\u00a0pregnant women were excluded.  One of the research team members approached\u00a0individual women to explain the questionnaire items to help solve any difficulty in understanding them. Participants were made aware that this questionnaire would not be a part of their ongoing care, and declining to participate would not compromise their care level. The participants were asked to sign an informed consent form that was provided and explained by the interviewer before the enrollment. The participants were also told that they could omit the answer for any question they found bothersome or embarrassing. They could exclude themselves from the study at any point in the future according to their will.  Baseline clinical and demographic data were collected from electronic clinical records, with the assigned case numbers\u00a0for de-identification and confidentiality. The participants were expected to answer the items directly by encircling the most appropriate answer for what they felt during the last two weeks. The exact timing of the response would be calculated. The proposed time was around 15-30 minutes.  This pilot study, which lasted for five days, helped us identify any logistical difficulties in implementing the questionnaire by both the women and the research team. To achieve this goal, we initially enrolled 30 women with PCOS from each group, who agreed to answer the questionnaire according to the previously mentioned instructions. After the conclusion of the pilot study, no change had been made to the structures of the questionnaires. The next step was to measure questionnaires' reliability on a larger scale.  Phase 2: Statistical analysis of reliability  Reliability measures the questionnaire's reproducibility for different individuals or in various situations by measuring the presumed outcome, which should be the same irrespective of the change in respondents [ 13 ].  Test-retest reliability  Test-retest reliability is useful to measure the stability of the HRQoL questionnaires on different occasions [ 13 ].  The retest evaluation was scheduled within five to seven days from the initial interview (test). We enrolled women with PCOS who attended FDEMC within the next 60 days. The timing between the test and retest was planned to minimize any recall bias, i.e., patients memorizing their initial responses without reading the questionnaire items on retest occasion.  Participants would not receive any treatment intervention that would alter their HRQoL during these five to seven days. The duration between the first and second visits was determined by the women receiving the results of their investigation by the central endocrine laboratory. We enrolled 195 married women and 173 unmarried women with PCOS, who consented to the test-retest reliability evaluation, to answer the PCOSQoL-53 and PCOSQoL-45, respectively.  The Spearman's correlational analysis rho (\u03c1) and Wilcoxon nonparametric signed-rank test were used to calculating the statistical differences between the two occasions' ordinal scores. We calculated the two-way mixed intraclass correlations (ICC) coefficients to evaluate for any significant relationship (p: \u22640.05) between the scores at the two times and draw a heat map for the items according to their corresponding score. The coefficient values of >0.7 were considered good, >0.8 were optimal, and >0.9 were determined excellent to measure the ICC [ 14 ].  Internal consistency  The statistical method used to measure the association of the items within the scale was Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient, which ranges between zero and one. Scores of >0.7 meant that the questionnaire items were measuring related constructs. Scores that were very close to 1 indicated higher redundancy of the scale of the item. We recalculated the Cronbach's alpha after removing individual domain items with low scores, to make the scale more reliable. If the alpha coefficient score increased after a question was removed, this would mean that the item had no correlation with other items in the domain. This process measured the item-total consistency and internal reliability of the items (Presentation:\u00a0Gliem JA, Gliem RR. Calculating, interpreting, and reporting Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliability coefficient for Likert-type scales.\u00a02003 Midwest Research to Practice Conference in Adult, Continuing and Community Education. Columbus, OH). We also calculated the inter-item correlations for each domain's items, intending to reach a corrected inter-item correlation mean of more than 0.3. The inter-rater reliability analysis was also calculated.  Upon completing these two steps of the test-retest study, which could also be considered an item reduction step, we excluded six items from the PCOSQoL-53 (A10, B9, E1, E2, E4, and E6) to reduce the items to 47, and the questionnaire was renamed as (PCOSQoL-47). We excluded three items from the PCOSQoL-45 (A7, C8, and C9) to bring the items down to 42, and the questionnaire was renamed a (PCOSQoL-42). The third draft of both questionnaires was created (Tables 7 , 8 ).

The questionnaires' data were captured directly on an already prepared IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) format by the interviewer. It was then checked and compared by two other research members for consistency and accuracy of the data.  The statistical analysis was done using the same version of SPSS; we performed the nonparametric correlation, bivariate correlation, and reliability construct validity analysis at a two-tailed significance level of \u22640.05.  All the paper forms were sorted and stored according to the first author's registration numbers, and they were kept ready to be retrieved on request from any respondent. All enrolled women were provided with a copy of their responses\u00a0to ensure transparency in dealing with their data. All women were told that they would be free to withhold their consent at any time during the study till the time of final publication, and this would not affect in any way the level of medical care provided for them in FDEMC. However, none of the women withheld their consent.  Ethical approval  All the study phases which involved interviewing women with PCOS were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Faiha Specialized Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolism Center Research Committee, from which the ethical approval was obtained, and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.  Informed consent  Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study, during all phases of the study.    Results  Phase 1  After the initial steps of item retrieval, the items-reduction phases were pivotal in determining the construct dimensions, questionnaire's items development and format, and questionnaire length. The first\u00a0draft of the items for the questionnaires in Arabic was created after an exhaustive analysis of content validity. The first draft for unmarried women contained 45\u00a0items and was encoded as PCOSQoL-45, while that of married women contained 57\u00a0items and was encoded as PCOSQoL-57 (Tables 1 - 4 ). The mean CVI and CVR for the PCOSQoL-45 were 0.94\u00a0and 0.92, and those for PCOSQoL-57 were 0.92\u00a0and 0.93, respectively.  The face validity analysis for both questionnaires, which was done through 30 women with PCOS from each group\u00a0along with 30 healthcare experts, created the second drafts for the questionnaires. No change was carried out for the PCOSQoL-45, unlike PCOSQoL-57, from which four items were omitted, to be renamed as PCOSQoL-53 (Tables 5 , 6 ).  The pilot study  The resultant draft was used in the five-day pilot study on 30 women with PCOS from each group and was attached to a five-point Likert scale. The score of 1 denoted that the complaint item was always\u00a0present, and 5 denoted that this complaint item was never\u00a0perceived in the last two weeks before the presentation (Tables 5 , 6 ). The pilot study pointed out some logistical difficulties in implementing the questionnaires for women with PCOS. It gave us an idea about the general characteristics of women, which would be considered in the next steps. The general characteristics of women in the pilot study are summarized in Table 9 .

We enrolled 173 unmarried and 195 married women to respond to PCOSQoL-45 and PCOSQoL-53, respectively. No woman had been excluded or none had defaulted during the test-retest evaluation. Table 10 presents the general characteristics of enrolled women in the test-retest reliability evaluation. The response rate of women with each item is presented in Table 11 .

The maximal drop-out in the test phase was for item E1 (Felt a lack of family support and acceptance of your disease?), where nine women declined to respond, with the least response rate of 95%. The overall response rate was around 39% for the retesting phase, with a range from 66% for the body image domain to 99% for the hair disorders and acne domain. The maximal drop-out in the retest phase was for item A5 (Suffered from low self-esteem due to PCOS?), where 13 women declined to respond, with the least response rate of 92.5%. Overall, only 61 women responded to all items during the test and retest phases, representing only 35%.

The maximal\u00a0drop-out item in the test and retest phases was item E9 (Felt you would accept all other PCOS manifestations if assured of pregnancy?) where 34 women declined to respond in the test phase, with the least response rate of 83%, vs. 31 women in retest phase with the least response rate of 84%. Overall, only 95 women responded to all items during the test and retest phases, representing only 49%.  For both PCOSQol-45 and PCOSQoL-53, using the Wilcoxon nonparametric signed-rank test and Spearman's correlation coefficient rho (\u03c1), the response to the items in the test and retest was similar with significantly related similar mean scores, with statistical significance (p< 0.001), during domain-wise (Table 12 ) and item by item-wise comparison (Table 11 ). The (\u03c1) for the item by item\u00a0and per-domain were positively and strongly related at a two-tailed significance level of <0.001. All domains had significantly high (\u03c1) (>0.9), which indicated high reliability of the use of domain items across the two occasions in both questionnaires.  To complete the reliability analysis of the questionnaires, we performed further internal consistency analysis of the data by estimation of the Cronbach's alpha, inter-item correlation analysis, and the two-way mixed ICC (total agreement type), within a 95% confidence interval, and a two-tailed significance level of \u22640.05. Table 13 presents the internal consistency reliability analysis steps for both questionnaires in the test-retest evaluation. The overall alpha score for all domains was highly redundant for all items in both questionnaires, i.e., >0.9, which indicates excellent test-retest reliability, and excellent inter-rater reliability. The inter-item correlations and ICC for the items per domain in both questionnaires were >0.9, and indicated excellent internal reliability of the dimensions, and suggested a highly significant relationship between the questionnaires' domains.  We also calculated the inter-item correlations for each domain's items, intending to reach a corrected inter-item correlation mean of >0.3.

Internal consistency reliability analysis used Cronbach's alpha to aid item reduction. The item would be deleted if the domain's alpha coefficient scored more after its deletion.  Cronbach's alpha values before and after deletion for each item per domain are presented in Table 14 . This step was considered as an item-reduction step through qualitative and quantitative analyses. All items were significantly related to each other, corresponding item with a two-tailed significance level of <0.001. We did not write it in the table for simplicity.

Item C9 (Felt concerned about a fast return to your previous weight after any weight loss?) was deleted because the Cronbach's alpha of the corresponding domain would increase if we deleted it. This was achieved in retest analysis only. All deleted items had the lowest corrected item-total correlation coefficients. On the other hand, the corrected item-total correlation coefficients values for the hair disorders and acne domain\u00a0were lower than other domains in the questionnaire, especially for the items D1, D5, D9, and D11, but this did not affect the reliability of the domain to measure the respected outcome, given its high Cronbach's alpha and ICC coefficients. We recoded the PCOSQoL-45 to be PCOSQoL-42 to represent the resultant 42 items at their different domains after deleting the three items during the reliability analysis.  For PCOSQoL-53, five items were deleted to increase the Cronbach's alpha reliability of their corresponding domains. These items were A10 (Felt disappointed about the cure?), B9 (Felt dyspareunia during sexual intercourse?), E1 (Felt concerned about being overweight?), E2 (Felt the need to decrease your weight to control PCOS?), and E4 (Concerned to reduce your weight to be more attractive for your husband?). Item E6 (Felt concerned about menstruation at long intervals?) was deleted because the Cronbach's alpha of the corresponding domain would increase if we deleted it. This was achieved in the retest analysis only.  All deleted items had the lowest corrected item-total correlation coefficients. Item C7 (Embarrassed to engage in social activities because of your appearance?) had the lowest ICC coefficient. Still, it was not deleted as it contributed to the higher Cronbach's alpha of its corresponding domain. We recoded the PCOSQoL-53 to be PCOSQoL-47 to represent the resultant 47 items at their different domains after the deletion of the six items during the reliability analysis.  The two questionnaires were proven to have a significant-excellent level of reliability during the test and retest analysis; we can now proceed to use them in the field to examine their validity in different groups of women with PCOS. Subsequently, third resultant English and Arabic drafts (Tables 15 , 16 ; Tables 17 , 18 in the Appendix section) were created. These drafts will be discussed in a different article.

The two most important questionnaires for HRQoL estimation in women with PCOS have been the 26-item\u00a0PCOS questionnaire (PCOSQ) by Cronin et al. [ 15 ] and the most recent PCOSQ-50 by Nasiri-Amiri et al. [ 16 ]. The PCOSQ-50 is a 50-item\u00a0questionnaire for women with PCOS, regardless of their marital status, with some culturally related modifications\u00a0to suit the Iranian community [ 16 ], which is similar in its marital relations, traditions, and norms to the Iraqi community. These two reliable and validated questionnaires were the inspiration and the foundation for our work in developing the first disease-specific questionnaires for Arabic women with PCOS.  In this study, we tried to develop two HRQoL questionnaires, one for unmarried women and the second for married women with PCOS, in which we kept in mind that unmarried women in our conservative community are not sexually active, and the sexual activity is confined to married women; that is why we did not include sexual activity items in the questionnaire for unmarried women.  We used sophisticated qualitative and quantitative analyses for reliability and to create these two questionnaires for women with PCOS, with particular emphasis on the sexual and fertility issues faced frequently by these women. The qualitative and quantitative approaches started earlier at the item pool formation. The items development process lasted about four months, after which we got the final number of well-validated item pools in terms of content and face validity, by adopting the rules of Lawshe\u00a0[ 8 ]\u00a0and Ayre and Scally [ 9 ], to reach the maximally validated scores. We chose the minimal CVI and CVR as \u22650.65 and \u22650.3, respectively, as they corresponded to the 40-item\u00a0pool concept, which is the maximal number described by the latter [ 9 ]. Although we set these two low cut-points as indicators, the minimal CVI and CVR for a given item in our scales were higher, i.e., >0.7.  The choice of having five domains for each questionnaire was determined by the redundancy of the items as frequently encountered by women with PCOS. The retrieved items in both questionnaires covered most of the PCOS aspects as creating a negative impact on HRQoL. We tried to include as many\u00a0sexuality-related, acne, and hirsutism items as possible, to overcome some of the limitations of PCOSQ and PCOSQ-50.  The CVI and CVR of both questionnaires were around 0.92, which was similar to the 0.92 of the PCOSQ-50 [ 16 ], i.e., similar content validity indices. Other parameters were slightly in favor of our questionnaires like the higher rho (\u03c1) coefficient in test-retest reliability analysis (0.98 for PCOSQoL-42, range 0.94-0.96; and 0.96 for PCOSQoL-47, range 0.90-0.96) vs. 0.75 for PCOSQ-50. Cronbach's alpha for PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47 was 0.996 and 0.991, respectively, vs. 0.88 for PCOSQ-50. This indicated that both questionnaires had higher reliability and internal consistency than PCOSQ-50.  We did not compare PCOSQoL-42 or PCOSQoL-47 to the 26-items PCOSQ of Cronin et al. because of its limited sensitivity, poor content and face validity, and reflectivity of HRQoL in these women with different phenotypes of PCOS [ 15 , 17 ], pertaining to physical symptoms and missing many QoL issues raised by the qualitative literature, such as acne [ 17 ].  The negative effect of PCOS on the psychological domains is evident and well-studied. Women with PCOS experience more incidences of neurotic disorders, aggression, and avoidance behavior [ 2 , 16 , 18 ]. The broad symptomatic spectrum of women with PCOS may affect their sexual function directly, or indirectly by obesity and body image dissatisfaction, which is frequently perceived by women with PCOS due to the associated clinical hyperandrogenic signs like hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and acne [ 2 , 19 ]. The psychological and sexual domains are interrelated with causal relationships [ 19 ].  According to Nasiri-Amiri et al., the ability to tolerate the scope of the symptoms and signs of PCOS is affected by all the health dimensions (physical, mental, emotional, cognitive, social, and even the role functioning dimensions), and evaluating any coping mechanism is pivotal in estimating the HRQoL in any questionnaire [ 2 , 16 , 18 ].  There were two items related to the acne's effect on the general appearance that were kept in mind during the whole process of questionnaire evaluation. Acne is an important sign, which was frequently overlooked by the previous questionnaires [ 15 , 16 ]. The consideration of acne as a reliable sign of clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS is controversial, given the previous observations among many women with different acne severities who had an average androgen level, and the lack of significant direct or causal correlation between hyperandrogenemia and acne. The underlying mechanism for this discrepancy might be attributed to the selective sebum production by the pilosebaceous unit in response to different concentrations of local or peripheral androgen in genetically susceptible women with PCOS [ 20 ].  The questionnaires' conceptual models were assessed through a psychometric cascade for reliability and validation to assess the questionnaire\u2019s framework acceptability, responsiveness, and interpretability in a specific population [ 11 ]. There was no consensus on the scale characteristics to measure a requested health-related outcome from the patient perspective, especially scale length, item wordiness, or item length [ 21 ]. We tried our best to include positive, negative, and mixed wording formats in various items in our scales. This altering response alternative orientation was useful to restrict acquiescence by participants, without altering the scale [ 22 ].  Regarding the scale length, we used the 5-point Likert scale in both questionnaires, which was not short or long in scale length, by which the respondents were able to differentiate the intensity and directionality of their responses, with a neutral response in between. Increasing the scale length may have caused the participants to confuse how to translate their opinion into the scale, especially if they were cognitively apathetic or unprepared, leading to chances of resorting to heuristic responses [ 23 ].  The response time in the pilot study, the test-retest reliability analysis, and the final step of construct validity evaluation ranged from 15 to 30 minutes for both questionnaires, which is similar to what was\u00a0primarily proposed by the research group during the item pool formation. Response time elapsed in answering questions is an important variable in the measuring scales, which may provide understanding related to some cognitive points during responding. It can be considered as an indicator of the recall ability that influences responding, for which any latency may indicate faulty design characteristics of the scale [ 24 ].  For test-retest reliability analysis, the timeline between the two occasions (five to seven days) was not so short, which helped to avoid recall or reporting bias among the participants that would have led them to memorize their previous responses in the initial test, and not so long during which the health status of the woman might change, as shown in previous reports [ 13 ].  The response rate was calculated for respondents who completed all items in a domain with no omission of any items (Table 10 ). The response rate of married women to their measuring scale showed no change between the two occasions as per the domain-wise and overall scale-wise patterns. While the response rate of unmarried women was profoundly low\u00a0domain-wise and overall scale-wise patterns, we have no explanation for this discrepancy in response, given the same venue, interviewer, and logistics on both occasions. Still, the response rate ranged from acceptable to excellent in the two sets.  Our two questionnaires showed higher internal consistency, stability, and ICC during the test-retest reliability analysis compared to those of the PCOSQ-50 and PCOSQ [ 15 , 16 ]. Our questionnaire contained elements that had been overlooked or neglected by other questionnaires, a special domain for hair disorders and acne. A detailed sexual function and fertility domain may lead to higher reliability in assessing PCOS-related issues.  Hulin et al. had voiced concerns of a very high Cronbach's alpha coefficient during the reliability analysis, which may result from decreased validity due to acquiescence bias, especially in agreement responses. This type of bias, which was mostly seen in nonmotivated women, could not be neglected [ 22 , 25 ]. This was not the case in our questionnaires because there was a fluctuation in the responses and mean scores per domain, which ultimately explained the different item responses.  Our study's main strength lay in the study design, which included sequential analysis by both qualitative and quantitative statistical methods to reach the final scales for assessing the QoL in both married and unmarried women. During the whole study, we came across all PCOS phenotypes in different women, which provided an element of diversity in the responses for different subscales, and made the scales useful in any woman with PCOS regardless of the phenotype. The sexuality items were not selected for unmarried women, which might explain the high response rate across the study. However, the same items were a limiting factor for the married women's responses.  We used simple Arabic language with minimal use of ambiguous and medical terms to make the items more accessible to women from both groups. We also avoided words that might have various meanings and stuck\u00a0to the use of original, one-meaning words.  Additionally, the PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47 have addressed the concept of being sexually active and inactive properly by avoiding the inclusion of sexual themes in the scale described for unmarried women, which makes these two questionnaires applicable for any community with similar sexual norms. The structure of both scales provided the luxury of choosing between the two according to the sexual activity.  Due to its simple language format, these questionnaires can be translated to any language with ease and can be especially useful for communities similar to ours. Still, the measurement properties alone are not indicative of suitability among different populations [ 11 ].    Conclusions  Both PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 are simple, highly reliable, easily comprehensible, and self-administered conceptual tools to evaluate different HRQoL measures in married and unmarried women with PCOS, whose first or native language is Arabic, regardless of their phenotype. After translation, these questionnaires could facilitate further studies in Arabic-speaking communities and other communities with similar norms regarding marriage and sexuality.",
