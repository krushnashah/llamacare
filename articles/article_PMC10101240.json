    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic and reproductive disorder associated with insulin resistance (IR), with an incidence of 5% to 10%. [ 1 ] The main clinical features of PCOS patients are androgen excess, menstrual disorder, and ovarian polycystic changes, and include obesity, abnormal glucose tolerance, IR, chronic inflammatory reactions, and other clinical features. The pathophysiology of PCOS is still unclear, but IR is closely related to the occurrence and development of PCOS. [ 2 ]  Previous studies have confirmed that dysregulation of some adipokines may play a role in the development of PCOS. Many PCOS patients tend to be overweight or obese and have IR. [ 3 ] Adipose tissue can secrete a variety of adipokines that regulate insulin sensitivity. [ 4 ] Asprosin is a novel adipokine secreted by white adipose tissue. Asprosin promotes hepatic glucose secretion by activating the G protein-cAMP/PKA pathway. [ 5 ] In human and animal experiments, it has been found that elevated serum asprosin level is associated with IR and obesity. [ 6 ] It is highlighted that elevated asprosin levels are associated with IR in humans and mice. Moreover, recombinant asprosin injection concludes with an elevation of blood glucose and insulin. [ 5 ] However, asprosin results have been inconsistent in studies of PCOS women. [ 7 \u2013 9 ] This study aimed to investigate the relationship between asprosin and PCOS complicated with IR.    2. Materials and Methods   2.1. Data source and collection  This was a retrospective case-control study. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Hangzhou Ninth People\u2019s Hospital. A total of 213 PCOS patients were included in the PCOS group (PCOS, n = 213) and 213 age-and body-mass index-matched healthy Controls (Controls, n = 213) from December 2018 to December 2019. All enrolled cases were aged between 16 and 40 years. Basic information including age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, menstrual history, and fertility history was collected.  The Rotterdam criteria were used for the diagnosis of PCOS: the presence of 2 of the following 3 criteria, namely: sparse ovulation or anovulation. Hyperandrogenemia or clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism (e.g., hirsutism, acne). Ultrasonography showed polycystic changes in the bilateral ovaries and/or ovarian volume enlargement (enlarged ovaries with increased stromal volume and > 10 follicles which measure 2 to 8\u2009mm in diameter and localize along the periphery of the ovary in a way to form a pearl necklace\u2019 appearance). [ 10 ] Exclusion criteria: Other causes of menstrual disorder and/or high androgen hematic disease (i.e., Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or other adrenal diseases, thyroid disease, pregnancy, and lactation), high blood pressure, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart failure, coronary heart disease, liver/kidney disease history, gestational diabetes, a malignant tumor or acute infection (within 14 days) and any chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, oral contraceptives, and/or antiandrogen drug therapy (within 6 months). Medical treatment for hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, IR, or obesity was excluded. All of the women in the control group had pelvic sonograms and none had ovarian volumes > 10\u2009mL or > 20 antral follicles in either ovary. The study was explained to each subject, and written informed consent was read and signed by all the participants.    2.2. Blood sample determination  During the early follicular phase of menstrual bleeding, 3rd to 5th days, in the morning (between 08:00 and 09:00) approximately following both onsets of early spontaneous or progesterone-induced menses and a 10 hours fasting period, 5ml of venous blood samples were gathered from the antecubital veins of the test subjects. Fasting venous blood samples of the subjects were collected and centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being analyzed.). Serum levels of asprosin, fasting insulin (FINS), fasting plasma glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, TG (triglycerides), C-reactive protein (CRP), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and total testosterone (TT) were measured by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (UniCel DXI 800; Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA). Commercially available human ELISA kits, with Catalog number AG-45B-0010-KI01, purchased from Adipogen Corporation., San Diego, CA was used to degree serum asprosin levels in duplicate by the instructions of manufacturers. The rates for the intra-assay coefficient of variability (CV) and the inter-assay CV in percentage were <7% and <10%, respectively. The measurement range for circulating asprosin levels is between 0.3125 and 20\u2009ng/mL. Insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) [fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting serum insulin (\u03bcIU/mL)/22.5]. [ 11 ] Insulin resistance: HOMA-IR \u2265 3, non-IR: HOMA-IR < 3.    2.3. Statistical analysis  Summary statistics are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD for continuous variables. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to test the normal distribution of variables. The means of variables for the PCOS group and control group were tested using Student t test for independent groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used for correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis was used for the independence test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity for different levels of serum asprosin in predicting IR in women with PCOS. The variables were considered statistically significant for the model at P < .05. All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical packages for SPSS version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).     3. Results   3.1. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the study population  There were no significant differences in age, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, low-density lipoprotein, TC, and FSH between the PCOS group and the control group ( P > .05). The levels of asprosin, FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR, TG, CRP, LH, TT, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the PCOS group were higher than those in the control group ( P < .05). Serum levels of high-density lipoprotein and SHBG in the PCOS group were lower than those in the control group ( P < .05). The anthropometric, hormonal, and metabolic characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1 .   Table 1   Comparison of the demographic and laboratory characteristics of the subjects.

Correlation and multivariate regression analysis  Pearson correlation analysis showed that serum asprosin level in the PCOS group was correlated with BMI, FINS, FBG, HOMA-IR, and CRP ( P < .05). The author used multiple linear regression analysis and found that the serum asprosin level in the PCOS group was independently correlated with HOMA-IR and CRP, ( P < .05), but there was no correlation between serum asprosin level and BMI, FINS, and FBG in the PCOS group after adding other factors.

ROC curve analysis  The author used ROC curve analysis, and the results showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of asprosin was 0.826, its 95% CI was 0.773\u20130.879, and the cutoff value was 4.95\u2009ng/mL, P < .05. The results indicate that the serum asprosin level is a good diagnostic index for PCOS complicated with IR. The results were shown in Figure 1 .   Figure 1.

Discussion  Adipose tissue can secrete a variety of adipokines, which play an important role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, IR, and other metabolic processes. [ 12 ] Whether PCOS patients are obese or not, adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with metabolic disorders. Cytokine levels in patients with PCOS are dysregulated. [ 4 ] It was reported that numerous adipokines such as leptin, ghrelin, and irisin levels changed and affected insulin secretion and insulin\u2019s effect in women with PCOS. Adipokines such as adiponectin can affect insulin secretion and sensitivity. [ 2 ] Asprosin is a newly discovered adipokine, which is associated with abnormal glucose tolerance, IR, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. [ 4 ] Whether asprosin plays a role in women with PCOS was investigated by 3 independent research groups, but the results were contradictory. [ 7 \u2013 9 ] While Li et al and Alan et al reported that circulating asprosin levels were higher in women with PCOS compared to the controls. [ 7 , 8 ] Therefore, the author studied the relationship between asprosin and PCOS combined with IR. We found that the serum asprosin level in the PCOS group was higher than that in the control group, and the serum asprosin level was independently correlated with HOMA-IR. At the same time, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of asprosin was 0.826, indicating that asprosin was a good diagnostic index for PCOS complicated with IR.  Insulin resistance is an important pathophysiological mechanism of type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCOS. Many PCOS patients have IR, which plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of PCOS. [ 13 ] Previous studies have shown that serum asprosin level in type 2 diabetic patients is independently correlated with HOMA-IR. [ 14 ] This study found that the PCOS group had higher IR than the control group, and the serum asprosin level was independently correlated with HOMA-IR. In our study, the IR reported in patients with PCOS may have originated from a high level of asprosin in PCOS, because asprosin mediates the release of glucose from the liver into circulation, which leads to the accumulation of glucose in circulation, and there is an excessive secretion of insulin to take the increased circulating glucose to physiological limits, insulin cannot be used by the cells due to changes in insulin receptors after a certain threshold, and thus IR appears. [ 6 , 15 ] The fact that the IR homeostasis model assessment of IR\u2019s (HOMA-IR) values of patients with PCOS was found to be high confirmed this.  In addition, studies have found that asprosin can enter the center, by activating neurons to increase appetite, fat storage, and weight gain. [ 16 ] Our study found a positive correlation between serum asprosin level and BMI, but when we added other factors to the analysis, the asprosin level remained uncorrelated. Interestingly, we also found that serum CRP level was correlated with asprosin in the PCOS group. CRP is a marker of inflammatory response. The chronic inflammatory response is related to PCOS, and chronic inflammatory response aggravates the clinical symptoms of PCOS and leads to metabolic disorders. [ 17 ] Therefore, asprosin may play an important role in the development of PCOS by regulating the pathophysiology of IR and chronic inflammatory response.  There were some limitations to this study. A cause\u2013effect relation could not be established, since it was a retrospective analysis. However, it opens a novel approach toward understanding whether there is a link between molecules and disorders.  In conclusion, our study found that serum asprosin level and HOMA-IR in PCOS were significantly higher than those in the control group, and increased serum asprosin level was independently associated with PCOS combined with IR. The serum asprosin level can be used to assess PCOS combined with IR.
