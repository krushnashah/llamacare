    "abstract": "In 1985 to 1986, the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study enrolled 5115 Black or White participants, including 2788 women, aged 18 to 30\u2009years. Over the following 35\u2009years, the CARDIA study amassed extensive longitudinal data on women's reproductive milestones, spanning menarche to menopause. Although not initially conceived as a study of women's health, >75 CARDIA study publications address relationships between reproductive factors and events with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease, and social determinants of health. The CARDIA study was one of the earliest population\u2010based reports to note Black\u2010White differences in age at menarche and associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly gestational diabetes and preterm birth, have been assessed along with postpartum behaviors, such as lactation. Existing studies have examined risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and lactation, as well as their relationship to future cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, diagnoses, and subclinical atherosclerosis. Ancillary studies examining components of polycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian biomarkers, such as anti\u2010M\u00fcllerian hormone, have facilitated examination of reproductive health in a population\u2010based cohort of young adult women. As the cohort transitioned through menopause, examination of the importance of premenopausal cardiovascular risk factors along with menopause has improved our understanding of shared mechanisms. The cohort is now aged in the 50s to mid\u201060s, and women will begin to experience a greater number of cardiovascular events as well as other conditions, such as cognitive impairment. Thus, in the next decade, the CARDIA study will provide a unique resource for understanding how the women's reproductive life course epidemiology informs cardiovascular risk, as well as reproductive and chronological aging.",

One of the earliest reports was in Circulation in 1953.  1  In that issue, John H. Wuest Jr and colleagues reported that women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy had significantly greater coronary atherosclerosis than control women, although less than control men.  1  In 1958, Warren Winkelstein Jr and colleagues noted that the male/female ratio in death rates changed at approximately the age of 45\u2009years and could potentially be attributable to shifts in androgens and estrogens.  2  The authors stated that \u201cWe thought that a first approximation to such endocrine differences could be obtained by a study of menstrual and pregnancy patterns of patients with coronary artery disease. The preliminary results appeared sufficiently interesting to warrant reporting.\u201d  2  The subsequent text comments on the significant associations between surgical menopause and miscarriages with myocardial infarction. It was not until the 1980s that the more extensive epidemiologic reports from the NHS (Nurses' Health Study) were published. These reports were notable for their longitudinal examination of associations between contraception, parity, and menopause with future CVD.  3  ,  4  Epidemiologic studies, including the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study, were initiated to observe factors associated with CVD risk beginning in early adulthood.  The CARDIA study began enrolling participants aged 18 to 30\u2009years in 1985 to 1986,  5  ,  6  approximately the time that these epidemiologic studies were published. Original aims of the CARDIA study were to examine the distribution and determinants of CVD risk factors in Black and White young men and women and to identify associated risk factors, particularly lifestyle habits and behaviors, and eventually psychosocial factors and social determinants of health. Participants were recruited from 4 centers, located in Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, Minneapolis, MN, and Oakland, CA, to achieve a representative sample of Black and White individuals in the United States. At each field center, participants were recruited to achieve balance by sex, self\u2010reported race (Black and White), socioeconomic status (ie, more than high school education compared with high school or less), and age ( < 25 versus > 25\u2009years).  At baseline, Black women and White women had different mean levels of education (13.1 versus 14.5\u2009years, respectively), marital status (21% versus 29%, respectively), full\u2010time employment (46% versus 62%, respectively), residence in impoverished neighborhoods (13% versus 10%, respectively), and difficulty paying for basics (39% versus 32%, respectively).  7  Follow\u2010up examinations occurred every 2 to 3\u2009years during the first decade of the study and approximately every 5\u2009years thereafter, with telephone contact with participants occurring every 6\u2009months. As of September 2022, death rates per 1000 since 1985 were 109.0 in Black women versus 68.2 in White women. Retention of the survivors has been high, with >71% of surviving participants attending the year 30 examination.  5  ,  6  Mortality in Black women exceeded that in White men and White women. At the year 30 examination, Black women (n=957) and White women (n=957) had different mean levels of education (14.5 versus 16.0\u2009years, respectively); 29% of Black women and 14% of White women had less than a high school education.  Along with standard anthropometric measures, blood pressure assessments, and laboratory measures, the CARDIA study has collected medical and reproductive history, extensive nutritional information, physical fitness assessments, body composition imaging, ectopic fat imaging, medications, and CVD events. Participants have also undergone repeated imaging for assessment of vascular calcification, carotid intima\u2010media thickness, echocardiography, and brain structure and function. Ancillary studies have collected additional information on nontraditional risk factors, including oxidative stress and inflammation, and characterization of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome.  The recruitment of women in their reproductive years has provided a unique opportunity to assess longitudinally common exposures and characteristics in Black and White women with a range of social determinants of health using the core and ancillary measures of cardiovascular risk and a biorepository of stored samples. The repeated measures provided an opportunity to examine trajectories in risk factors from before conception and after pregnancy and lactation. Beginning in year 2, the CARDIA study has repeatedly assessed estrogen use through detailed inquiries about oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use and other hormonal and nonhormonal reproductive measures. The CARDIA study has also collected detailed survey information about fertility and pregnancy characteristics and outcomes, particularly adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preterm delivery  8  and gestational diabetes (GDM),  9  as well as lactation duration for sequential pregnancies. One ancillary study focused on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including symptoms, biochemical measures of androgens,  10  and radiographic imaging of the ovaries and uterus.  11  Another ancillary study of parous women measured adipokines and inflammatory and endothelial function markers in stored blood from multiple examinations beginning with the year 2 examination.  12  As the cohort transitioned through menopause, the CARDIA study assessed menstrual history and vasomotor symptoms (VMS),  13  CVD risk factor changes around the final menstrual period,  14  and relationships with subclinical measures of disease.  14    Four decades after the CARDIA study began enrolling participants, interest in women's reproductive health and impact on CVD health has grown. In 2021, >500 studies examining reproductive exposures in women and subsequent CVD risk were cited in PubMed. Although initial studies focused on changes in traditional CVD risk factors, more recent reports examine the possible shared mechanisms between reproductive factors and CVD risk. These investigations have been enabled by the measurement of CVD risk factors at multiple time points before and after reproductive events. In this review article, we describe CARDIA studies for each reproductive milestone. We include all of the CARDIA studies that addressed reproductive milestones (ie, menarche, contraception, PCOS, pregnancy, GDM, preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, lactation, breastfeeding, menopause, reproductive aging, anti\u2010M\u00fcllerian hormone, infertility, hot flashes, and VMS). A total of 77 reports are listed in Tables 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . A brief summary of relevant literature accompanies each description. We also identify content that could be explored further on the relationships between these reproductive milestones and CVD risk, which is particularly relevant as the cohort is transitioning through middle age. Investigations could be conducted through collaborations with CARDIA study investigators as well as through public use data sets.

MENARCHE  At the time of baseline data collection in the CARDIA study, women were aged 18 to 30\u2009years and had already experienced menarche about 5 to 13\u2009years earlier. Thus, misclassification of age at menarche is possible. However, in the CARDIA study, recall of the age at menarche had adequate precision to note a racial discrepancy in menarche, 12.45\u2009years in Black women and 12.73\u2009years in White women  15  (Table 1 ). Subsequently, the racial discrepancy in age at menarche between Black and White women was reported in other cohorts.  16  ,  17  In the CARDIA study, each earlier year of menarche was associated with greater body mass index (BMI)  18  as well as visceral adiposity.  19  After adjustment for BMI, earlier menarche predicted adverse glucose and lipid levels  18  as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),  19  with associations stronger in White than Black women.  The CARDIA study findings for the association between earlier age at menarche and poorer CVD risk factor profiles are generally congruent with previous studies, but unique in examinations by Black compared with White women. Similar findings were reported in the Fels Longitudinal Study,  20  a cohort of White adolescents. Other reports noted that women who were older at baseline and who recalled early age menarche (<12\u2009years) had increased risk of CVD events and mortality.  21  ,  22  ,  23  ,  24  These cohorts consisted of primarily White or East Asian women.  21  ,  22  ,  23  ,  24  Two reports noted that menarche after the age of 17\u2009years was also associated with slightly increased risk.  22  ,  23  However, examination of interactions by race or ethnicity have not been reported for those studies.  The associations between menarche and puberty with CVD risk factors have been attributed to several mechanisms (Figure 1 ). Childhood socioeconomic status and household structure have long been recognized to predict both early menarche  25  as well as later life CVD events,  26  ,  27  although the extent to which these operate through or apart from subsequent lifestyle behaviors and traditional CVD risk factors is not completely understood. These pathways may include greater childhood BMI,  28  catch\u2010up growth during infancy,  29  and associated adipokine dysregulation,  30  which confer risk of early menarche and long\u2010term adiposity, as well as the other exposures indicated in Figure 1 . The prolonged exposure to estrogen, which accompanies early age at menarche, was not associated with higher CVD risk in the WISE (Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation) study.  22     Figure 1   Potential shared mechanisms between sexual maturation and cardiovascular risk.     Two hypotheses comment on the impact of the in utero nutritional environment on offspring CVD risk profiles and have been supported by epidemiologic studies. The Barker or \u201cthrifty\u2010phenotype\u201d hypothesis proposes that fetal deprivation in combination with an enriched nutritional environment in later childhood is associated with CVD risk.  31  ,  32  The Pederson hypothesis notes that fetal overnutrition (maternal overweight or hyperglycemia) can modify fetal metabolism,  33  and maternal overweight and obesity have since been noted to be associated with risk of offspring metabolic syndrome  34  and of CVD events as well.  35  ,  36  ,  37  ,  38  Interestingly, both fetal undernutrition  39  as well as overnutrition  40  have also been associated with earlier onset of puberty, suggesting that in utero exposures may modify sexual development as well as offspring cardiovascular risk. Epigenetic modifications in utero or after birth may be a shared mechanism through which early sexual maturation  41  and CVD risk  42  occur, although the precise methylation sites and their role in fetal and infant metabolism and development are still not completely understood. As the CARDIA study cohort ages, such shared mechanisms examining menarche (as well as other reproductive milestones) and CVD risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, CVD events, and differences by race should be explored further.    CONTRACEPTION  The CARDIA study has collected data on OCPs and other hormonal contraception at each examination until the cohort transitioned through menopause. Questions have included length of use and no use since the last examination. At the year 10 examination, when women were on average aged 34 (range, 28\u201340)\u00a0years, the CARDIA study surveyed women's lifetime history of specific hormonal contraceptive formulations.  43  Subsequent examinations also collected information on contraceptive formulations. Thus, it is possible to link women's CVD risk factor profile with OCP use by age at the time of use, duration, and formulation.  44    Contraceptive studies in the CARDIA study have focused on OCPs (Table 1 ). OCP use increased between baseline and the year 7 examination (between 1985 and 1992) in White women, but not in Black women.  45  OCP use at the time of examination was correlated with higher levels of inflammatory markers, including white blood cell count  46  and fibrinogen.  47  However, subsequent CARDIA study reports did not observe that OCP use was cross\u2010sectionally associated with metabolic dysfunction (ie, elevations in insulin, glucose, blood pressure, or lipids) as a pathway to CVD (Table 1 ). In fact, OCP use was associated with lower levels of glucose, possibly attributable to changes in OCP formulations over the past 30\u2009years.  43  These associations persisted after adjustment for confounders, including age, education, weight, and race, and could represent residual confounding or a true protective effect.  Epidemiologic studies in other cohorts have focused on short\u2010term, rather than long\u2010term, risk of thromboembolic events  48  and ischemic heart disease.  48  ,  49  Beginning in the 1960s, the earliest forms of estrogen\u2010progestin pills contained 150\u2009\u03bcg of mestranol or ethinyl estradiol, but the dosage of ethinyl estradiol was decreased because of common adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting, and adverse effects, including thromboembolism.  50  The vast majority of OCPs prescribed today have < 35\u2009\u03bcg of ethinyl estradiol, including OCPs with <20\u2009\u03bcg of ethinyl estradiol. In studies of French  51  and Danish  52  women, 20\u2009\u03bcg OCPs were associated with significantly lower risk for pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction than formulations with 30 to 40\u2009\u03bcg of ethinyl estradiol. Pills containing third\u2010generation progestins desogestrel and gestodene were associated with higher risk of pulmonary events than pills with levonorgestrel (the second\u2010generation progestin that also is included in hormonal intrauterine devices and implantable rods).  51  This research is congruent with older studies noting that lower doses of estrogen are linked with lower risk.  53  Therefore, OCPs are not recommended for women at increased risk for thromboembolic disease, including women who smoke and are aged > 35\u2009years or women with uncontrolled hypertension, thrombophilia, or history of thromboembolic disease.  54    Whether OCPs and other hormonal contraception affect atherosclerosis and longer\u2010term CVD risk is less clear. There was substantial variation in OCP use within CARDIA study women during follow\u2010up. The repeated measures, however, provide an opportunity to conduct time\u2010varying exposure analyses. The adverse associations with blood pressure  55  and the favorable associations with concurrent glucose levels and diabetes in the CARDIA study are similar in their reports of neutral  56  or beneficial associations  57  ,  58  in other studies. Therefore, prospective studies examining cumulative impact on longer\u2010term risk factor profiles, atherosclerosis markers, and events need to be conducted. Examination of transdermal forms, including the vaginal ring and levonorgestrel formulations, should also be undertaken. Such studies will eventually be possible in the CARDIA study. This is particularly relevant for women who use long\u2010term hormonal contraception for its favorable effects on bleeding, hirsutism, and acne, such as women with PCOS.  59      POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME  PCOS is believed to be the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive\u2010aged women, with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 10%.  60  Because it is diagnosed on the basis of hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries, PCOS is typically first identified in the reproductive years. In 2021, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop concluded that women with PCOS commonly were affected by obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, NAFLD, and sleep\u2010disordered breathing, but evidence for independent associations between PCOS and CVD was not conclusive.  60  In part, this uncertainty stems from the fact that diagnostic criteria for PCOS and recommendations for screening have evolved over the past several decades.  61  ,  62  ,  63  Figure 2 shows classification schemes based on symptoms and biochemical measures,  62  ,  64  as well as more recent categories based on unsupervised machine\u2010learning algorithms and genome\u2010wide association studies.  65     Figure 2   Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) classification schemes.  Top panel: Phenotype \u201cA\u201d consists of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Phenotype \u201cB\u201d consists of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. Phenotype \u201cC\u201d consists of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology. Phenotype \u201cD\u201d consists of ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Bottom panel: PCOS subtypes include a reproductive subtype, a metabolic subtype, and an indeterminate subtype distinguished by levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone\u2013binding globulin (SHBG), body mass index (BMI), and fasting insulin. (Levels of testosterone were elevated compared with controls but did not distinguish between PCOS subtypes.)     Another factor contributing to our incomplete understanding of CVD in PCOS is a lack of prospective and long\u2010term longitudinal studies that include participants with well\u2010characterized PCOS.  60  Accordingly, investigators have sought to use the CARDIA study to gain an understanding of the trajectory of cardiometabolic features in participants with PCOS as they transition to their postreproductive years. In the CWS (CARDIA Women's Study), an ancillary study to the CARDIA study, women participating in the year 15 examination were invited to a year 16 ancillary study visit. The CWS participants consented to measurements of their androgens (testosterone and sex hormone\u2013binding globulin) from the year 2 examination, when they were about 27\u2009years of age, as well as from the year 10 and year 16 examinations.  66  Women were also asked to characterize their menstrual cycles, excess hirsutism, and OCP use between the ages of 20 and 30\u2009years. Initial CWS reports examined relationships between androgens and cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes, including one report showing that changes in androgens were tightly correlated with changes in BMI  67  (Table 2 ). In another study, free testosterone levels predicted carotid intima\u2010media thickness.  68  Subsequent studies have further defined PCOS by identifying subjects with both hyperandrogenism (either defined by excess hair growth or biochemical hyperandrogenemia) and oligomenorrhea. Using this approach, investigators found that participants with PCOS had stronger associations with diabetes,  69  dyslipidemia,  69  subclinical atherosclerosis,  10  ,  66  and left ventricular mass compared with those without PCOS. These associations were independent of lifestyle behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, and similar associations were not present when subjects with either isolated hyperandrogenism or oligomenorrhea were considered, suggesting the independence and importance of the full syndrome in predicting cardiometabolic outcomes.  70  However, the relationship between isolated hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea with other outcomes, such as APOs and lactation duration, may warrant future investigation.  Other CARDIA studies have reported links between PCOS and factors that may contribute to CVD outcomes. Notably, depression risk,  71  which has predicted adverse cardiovascular health in other CARDIA studies, is also increased in those with PCOS in the CARDIA study, with the highest symptom burden noted in Black women. In non\u2010CARDIA studies, reports using hospitalization data,  72  electronic medical record data,  73  and other cohorts  73  note that PCOS may also be linked with peripartum cardiovascular complications as well as GDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs), which in and of themselves confer CVD risk (Figure 3 ). Thus, CARDIA study data could also be used to examine how various life course events, including reproductive events and mood disorders, contribute to the relationships between PCOS and CVD.   Figure 3   Reproductive life course events may be associated with each other and share precursors with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and jointly contribute to CVD.  Upward arrows indicate higher associated CVD risk, and downward arrows indicate lower associated CVD risk. *Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) include gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and preterm birth. PCOS indicates polycystic ovary syndrome.     Although CARDIA study reports contribute to the growing body of work supporting a link between PCOS and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes,  74  ,  75  ,  76  ,  77  whether PCOS ultimately leads to increased rates of CVD events has not been definitively shown. The ages of participants in most epidemiologic studies that enroll reproductive\u2010aged women, including the CARDIA study, have not been sufficiently advanced to achieve this while the cohort was premenopausal. Furthermore, the magnitude of the associations between PCOS and cardiometabolic outcomes and whether all PCOS subsets are at risk remain unclear. One factor contributing to these uncertainties is the heterogeneity inherent to PCOS and differences in ascertainment of PCOS across various studies.  62  ,  65  ,  78  ,  79  Indeed, studies that rely on physician diagnosis may not identify all patients: In one 2020 study of electronic medical records in the United Kingdom,  80  approximately half of women who met PCOS criteria based on diagnoses of irregular menses, polycystic ovaries, or hyperandrogenism were not diagnosed. Similarly, another study from Australia reported that \u224870% of women meeting PCOS criteria were not diagnosed.  81  Therefore, studies relying on a clinical diagnosis may be subject to various forms of selection bias, including overrepresentation of subjects with more adverse features, and/or improved health care access. Improved strategies to identify PCOS in epidemiologic studies are needed to improve our understanding of PCOS and CVD risk across a more diverse sample. Toward this end, recent genome\u2010wide association studies suggest that \u2010omics data could potentially serve as an adjunct to clinical criteria in identifying subtypes of women with PCOS at high risk for chronic diseases,  65  including CVD and malignancy.    ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES  The CARDIA study has examined the relationships between several adverse pregnancy outcomes with CVD risk factors (Table 3 ). Pregnancy features were reported at every examination, and the CARDIA validation studies have demonstrated excellent maternal recall of infant birth weight, preterm birth, gestational weight gain, and GDM.  8  ,  9  ,  82  Although women tended to overreport instances of HDPs,  83  the sensitivity of maternal recall of HDP was high, thus providing reliable data for normotensive pregnancies. Because of its periodic assessment of BMI and anthropometrics as well as laboratory measurements, the CARDIA study is one of the few longitudinal cohorts able to examine prepregnancy, postpregnancy, and postlactation cardiometabolic health. This has been particularly useful for examination of racial disparities in relation to APOs and childbearing as they influence CVD risk factors.  The CARDIA study was one of the earliest studies to note that first pregnancy resulted in permanent weight gain of several kilograms, except in smokers,  84  and not in women aged <25\u2009years, and that pregnancy might adversely affect distribution of adiposity as well as total number of kilograms.  15  ,  85  ,  86  ,  87  ,  88  Waist circumference and visceral fat increases were cumulative with each child, independent of overall adiposity,  87  which may be partially attributable to less physical activity and increased caloric intake.  89  ,  90  After adjustment for weight gain and lifestyle behavior changes after pregnancy, the CARDIA study has also reported that pregnancy is linked with lower high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol following a first birth  91  ,  92  and varies by apolipoprotein E phenotype,  93  and parity is associated with increased risk of incident metabolic syndrome.  94  In contrast, increasing parity was not associated with future risk of developing overt diabetes, unless women had a history of GDM.  9  Having at least one birth was also associated with lower long\u2010term blood pressure in the CARDIA study, but only among women who did not develop HDPs.  83  Biologic plausibility of a beneficial relationship of pregnancy with blood pressure has been supported by smaller studies that demonstrated that the characteristic decreases in peripheral resistance during pregnancy persist postpartum.  95  ,  96    Preterm births, pregnancies characterized by delivery before 37\u2009weeks of gestation, are a key contributor to Black\u2010White disparities in infant mortality in the United States.  97  The CARDIA study was one of the earliest studies to report that racial discrimination contributes to preterm birth risk and low birth weight risks and to note the Black\u2010White disparity in preterm birth rates, even after accounting for known risk factors, such as tobacco and substance use, as well as gestational weight gain.  98  Prepregnancy depressed mood also likely contributed to racial differences in preterm birth.  99  In the CARDIA study, adverse risk profiles predicted poorer pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth.  8  Interestingly, hypothesized predictors, such as endothelial dysfunction,  100  oxidative stress,  101  and cardiorespiratory fitness  102  or chronic kidney disease,  103  did not predict preterm birth. Apolipoprotein E2 allele was also associated with greater risk of miscarriage.  104    The CARDIA studies have also noted that preterm birth was independently associated with future adverse CVD risk profiles  105  and metabolic syndrome  106  as well as inflammatory markers and subclinical atherosclerotic markers, including carotid intima\u2010media thickness.  107  ,  108  These studies are congruent with studies from Norwegian cohorts on the associations between preterm delivery and risk of future adverse CVD risk factor levels  109  and CVD events.  110  In these Norwegian women, 10\u2010year CVD risk scores were higher in women with histories of APOs than in women without APOs.  111  Taken together, these studies suggest that preterm birth itself may modify CVD risk. Alternatively, preterm birth and CVD could potentially share precursors, such as CVD risk factors, but risk is incremental,  112  and novel modifiable targets are not currently known.  The CARDIA study has also examined the relationship of prepregnancy CVD risk factors with the risk of future GDM. In the CARDIA study, cardiometabolic risk factors independently associated with several fold higher risk of future GDM included elevated fasting glucose (ie, prediabetes), fasting insulin, and lower high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol levels independent of prepregnancy BMI and waist circumference.  113  These findings were the first to show that dysmetabolism strongly predicted GDM better than overall adiposity. Others showed that women with greater waist/hip ratio  114  and greater speed of weight gain before pregnancy  115  had greater risk of gestational weight gain  116  and incident GDM, even after adjustment for BMI. Along similar lines, the CARDIA study women with poorer CVD risk factor profiles  113  and lower study\u2010assessed fitness levels  117  were more likely to develop GDM. Others later reported findings that were similar in large cohorts of women, particularly for blood pressure and weight.  118  ,  119    In the CARDIA study, GDM was associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome, and a 4\u2010fold higher risk of incident diabetes after pregnancy,  94  particularly in Black women.  120  In the CARDIA study, GDM history has also been associated with higher carotid artery intima\u2010media thickness in midlife among women who did not develop the metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, or overt diabetes.  121  Even after consideration of BMI and traditional CVD risk factors, a history of GDM may still be associated with higher risk of impaired systolic ejection fraction.  122  A history of GDM was associated with a 2\u2010fold higher relative risk of coronary artery calcification for all levels of glucose tolerance (euglycemia, prediabetes, and overt diabetes) in midlife, suggesting that other established CVD risk factors may contribute substantially to atherosclerotic CVD risk.  121  Risk was elevated even when normoglycemia persisted many years after delivery.  123  In the CARDIA study, GDM history was also associated with adverse outcomes, such as the metabolic syndrome,  94  NAFLD,  124  and chronic kidney disease.  125  These studies are congruent with studies from other cohorts demonstrating associations between GDM and adverse outcomes, particularly diseases related to greater adiposity, including the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, CVD, NAFLD, and breast cancer.  126  ,  127  At least part of this risk is attributable to preconception BMI as well as higher postpartum weights among women with GDM, which tend to be higher compared with women without GDM.  128    Maternal recall of HDP in the CARDIA study, as in other epidemiologic studies enrolling women in perimenopause or postmenopause, is not adequate to distinguish between subtypes of HDPs (prepregnancy chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension) or accurately ascertain a history of HDPs. These subtypes of HDPs likely have different pathophysiology and different CVD sequelae.  129  Thus, examination of such studies has been limited in the CARDIA study. Studies from other cohorts have demonstrated that women with gestational hypertension have greater risk of CVD events compared with women who are normotensive during pregnancy,  130  ,  131  ,  132  and the link with future CVD is particularly marked for women who have preeclampsia.  The CARDIA study has previously validated women's self\u2010report of pregnancy metrics compared with medical records and found high correlation for most outcomes, including diabetes and weight.  9  ,  83  In general, although self\u2010report has limited accuracy to distinguish subtypes of HDPs in the CARDIA study and other studies, maternal report of key pregnancy metrics has high correlation with birth certificates  133  and electronic medical records. For example, one report  133  noted that 98% of mothers noted gestational age within 1\u2009week of the date noted on the birth certificate, and sensitivity and specificity of self\u2010report of preterm birth were 99% and for low birth weight were also high. Correlation between women's self\u2010report of GDM,  134  gestational age, and birth weight also had high correlation with medical records, years after diagnosis.  135  Obviously, examination of particular exposures during pregnancy, such as alcohol or tobacco use, may be subject to social desirability biases and might limit the accuracy of such analyses.  In general, the implications of APOs for prevention and treatment of future maternal chronic disease are not entirely elucidated. In the studies of Norwegian women, differences in the proportion of women who would be classified in different risk categories based on APOs was low.  111  In other words, the findings did not support reclassifying women with histories of APOs for different CVD screening procedures, beyond existing recommendations for CVD risk factor screening. However, interventions target preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods as potentially sensitive windows in which interventions could be useful.  136  Future potential studies in the CARDIA study could serve as exploratory studies leveraging the multiple ancillary studies in the CARDIA study to determine whether novel risk factors, such as epigenetic factors and telomere length,  137  might differ between women with normotensive pregnancies and women with HDPs. As the cohort ages, examining the relationships of specific types and severity of APOs with measures of later\u2010life functioning, particularly cognitive functioning, will be possible.    LACTATION  The CARDIA study was one of the first epidemiologic studies to examine the beneficial associations of breastfeeding on metabolic outcomes, such as diabetes. Gunderson and colleagues noted that lactation was related to ~50% lower risk of incident metabolic syndrome  12  as well as overt diabetes,  138  independent of preconception cardiometabolic risk profiles, BMI, perinatal outcomes, social factors, and follow\u2010up lifestyle behaviors, as well as strong protective associations among Black women, and among women with histories of GDM. The CARDIA study also noted that breastfeeding behavior may be related to other factors, including fat distribution, apart from BMI.  82  Independent of these factors, longer duration of lactation was associated with reduced odds of pericardial and visceral fat deposition,  139  NAFLD,  124  and carotid intima\u2010media thickness  140  (Table 4 ). CARDIA's prospective studies across the childbearing years show much stronger protective association for lactation than studies that obtained information on lactation close to or after the end of the reproductive lifespan. These cohorts have also reported longer duration of lactation to be favorable  141  and associated with improved glucose uptake,  142  ,  143  insulin sensitivity,  142  ,  143  and lipid metabolism,  142  ,  144  ,  145  leading to the reversal of some of the adverse metabolic changes brought on by pregnancy,  146  particularly lower risk of future diabetes among women with previous GDM.  147  These studies reported weaker associations of 10% relative risk reduction per year of lactation than observed in CARDIA, perhaps attributable to lack of adjustment for antecedent cardiometabolic risk factors before pregnancy or history of APOs. The positive effects of lactation on maternal metabolic health have been reported to last for >7 to 15\u2009years after the last birth,  148  and are associated with lower risk of CVD,  149  although the extent to which these findings are independent of preconception risk factors and history of APOs is unclear.  The mechanisms through which lactation may improve maternal health are not completely understood. To some extent, the favorable association may also reflect the fact that mothers who are obese before pregnancy face greater challenges to breastfeed their offspring, arising from medical conditions and adverse maternal and infant outcomes. These mothers are less likely to receive education on the benefits of lactation or be offered lactation support compared with normal weight mothers.  150  ,  151  Interestingly, in Sprague\u2010Dawley rats, lactation has favorable effects on oxidative stress markers.  152  Oxidative markers are available at several time points in the CARDIA study, including before and after pregnancy, and could assist in investigations of whether lactation modifies these markers significantly.  Finally, the benefits of lactation in combination with healthy infant feeding practices for childhood obesity have been well documented.  153  Studies from other cohorts have noted that women with GDM may have reduced breastmilk production as well as different quality breastmilk than women without GDM.  154  Whether the quality of breastmilk among infants with GDM has independent adverse effects on infant growth is not yet established.    REPRODUCTIVE AGING AND MENOPAUSE  When the CARDIA study women were on average aged 40\u2009years at the year 16 CWS ancillary study examination, 1163 women underwent transvaginal ultrasonography assessing ovarian volume, cysts, and uterine structure. The presence of uterine fibroids on the imaging also was noted. In the CARDIA study, Black women were more likely to undergo hysterectomy than White women.  155  The CARDIA study has used the ultrasound information along with surveys on menstrual frequency and ovarian markers (anti\u2010M\u00fcllerian hormone and follicle\u2010stimulating hormone) to expand prediction of menopause and understanding of nontraditional risk factors (Table 5 ). In addition to reporting associations between these markers and menopause,  156  ,  157  the CARDIA study reports also noted that anti\u2010M\u00fcllerian hormone does correlate with oxidative stress,  158  but does not correlate with other aging markers  159  that have been associated with CVD risk. These data were also used to examine infertility and race\u2010specific explanations. The CARDIA study women were asked whether they had not conceived during the past year despite unprotected intercourse.  160  Black women were more likely to have experienced infertility compared with White women, even after considering fibroids, ovarian volume, and smoking.  160    Because the CARDIA study was able to collect data on CVD risk factors before premenopause, the CARDIA study reports have been able to examine the relationships between premenopausal risk factors, menopausal status, and CVD risk.  161  ,  162  ,  163  ,  164  One of the most interesting findings from the CARDIA study is that surgical menopause and age at natural menopause after 45\u2009years were not strong predictors of CVD risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, or left ventricular indexes once presurgical or premenopausal risk factors were considered.  165  ,  166  ,  167  ,  168  The CARDIA study's reproductive aging reports complement those from studies that enrolled perimenopausal women, such as the SWAN (Study of Women Across the Nation), or perimenopausal and postmenopausal women enrolled in cardiovascular cohorts, such as the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study) and MESA (Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis).  169  ,  170  The CARDIA study and SWAN have both reported that risk factors are generally less favorable in the postmenopausal period than in the premenopausal period. Such changes are largely attributable to linear changes in aging, with the exception of lipids, which may change more rapidly during the perimenopausal transition.  171  ,  172    An exception to this relationship is menopause occurring before the age of 40\u2009years, which may represent a particularly high\u2010risk population.  169  ,  170  For instance, in other investigations of premature menopause, menopause before the age of 35\u2009years doubles the risk of an incident CVD event.  173  The CARDIA study adds to these studies in noting that premature menopause does not seem to be associated with greater risk of coronary artery calcification, suggesting that the relationship between premature menopause and CVD events occurs through pathways other than atherosclerosis.  167  In addition, other examinations suggest that inclusion of premature menopause as a CVD risk factor does not significantly improve assessment of risk based on traditional CVD risk factors.  174  However, CARDIA study data could be used to reveal causal pathways that enhance accelerated aging, because the CARDIA study measured repeated nontraditional risk factors before and after the last menstrual period. These pathways likely do not involve estrogen per se. Although the menopausal transition ultimately results in declines in endogenous estrogen levels, estrogen supplementation has had only slight beneficial to neutral impact on markers of subclinical atherosclerosis when given in the 5\u2009years after the final menstrual period in KEEPS (Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study)  175  and the ELITE (Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol).  176  Aging mechanisms contributing both to early menopause as well as CVD risk in postmenopausal populations have included clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential,  177  epigenetic age acceleration,  178  and telomere length,  179  which could potentially be assessed using premenopausal and postmenopausal measures in the CARDIA study.  Early menopause has also predicted greater risk of heart failure in other cohorts.  180  ,  181  ,  182  ,  183  ,  184  ,  185  As more heart failure cases are observed in the CARDIA study, there will be an opportunity to replicate these findings while taking into account premenopausal measurements of obesity in CARDIA study women. The relationship between menopause and heart failure has been further validated by studies involving NT\u2010proBNP (N\u2010terminal pro\u2010B\u2010type natriuretic peptide), which is a known biomarker for heart failure diagnosis and prognosis.  186  ,  187  ,  188  In cohorts of primarily perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, associations between age at the final menstrual period and sex hormones with NT\u2010proBNP have been demonstrated.  186  ,  187  ,  188  The CARDIA study has measurements of sex hormones and will be measuring heart failure biomarkers, and future studies can determine whether such associations exist during the reproductive years.  Finally, the CARDIA study has collected information on VMS, the severity of which were independent predictors of CVD risk.  189  Interestingly, such risk was synergistic with history of preterm birth, suggesting shared pathways spanning the reproductive years. Other studies, including SWAN, as well as meta\u2010analyses note that VMS are associated with increased risk of CVD by as much as 28%, even after adjustment for standard CVD risk factors.  190  ,  191  However, the specificity of VMS, the importance of length of symptoms and onset in relation to the final menstrual period, and the added benefit for reclassification of CVD risk have not been examined.    CONCLUSIONS  The CARDIA study has contributed to our understanding of how premenopausal reproductive events are associated with CVD risk factors and subclinical markers of atherosclerosis. As the CARDIA study cohort finishes its current round of data collection, the current age range of the surviving women is roughly 55 to 65\u2009years. Thus, life course analyses can examine contributions to existing marked racial disparities in women's health. Such analyses can examine associations between reproductive span and pregnancy\u2010lactation outcomes on CVD outcomes in the near future (Table 6 ).   Table 6   Limitations of CARDIA for Reproductive Milestone Analyses and Future Directions       Limitations      Represents Black and White populations in 4 metropolitan areas and may not extend to other areas of the United States    Information on contraception and pregnancy obtained through survey and less accurate for distinguishing between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy    Frequently repeated measurements during reproductive transitions (such as during each pubertal stage, pregnancy trimester, or each menopausal stage) not performed compared with studies designed to assess these transitions         Strengths and future directions      Examinations of interactions between trajectories of social determinants of health and reproductive milestones    Examination of clusters of reproductive milestones and joint relationships with CVD risk    Examination of relationships between reproductive milestones and cognitive and physical outcomes, including brain structure and cognitive performance    Combining data with other observational cohorts to increase representativeness and statistical power for examination of reproductive milestones.       CARDIA indicates Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults; and CVD, cardiovascular disease.     As an observational cohort, CARDIA study analyses cannot prove causal relationships between reproductive milestones and CVD risk. However, such examinations may serve as the basis through which to question potentially harmful practices, such as the routine performance of bilateral oophorectomy before epidemiologic analyses that such practices might be harmful for CVD health. In addition, the CARDIA study and other cohort studies may help to identify which reproductive factors might benefit from modification by examining dose\u2010response relationships, as with lactation or length of OCP use. Observational studies can also identify specific disorders and populations who might be useful to target in future randomized trials or through policy, such as provision of mental health services for women with preterm deliveries.  In addition to the suggestions for additional explorations noted under each reproductive milestone, there are general areas for which rich data are available but not fully leveraged. In consortia using data from multiple cohorts, CARDIA study genome\u2010wide association study data have been used to identify single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms associated with several reproductive characteristics, including fibroids,  192  age at menarche,  193  age at natural menopause,  194  and sex hormones, such as sex hormone\u2013binding globulin.  195  In combination with closer examination of social determinants of health, such data could be used to reduce residual confounding by unmeasured sociocultural, economic, or psychosocial factors when examining racial differences in such outcomes. The CARDIA study has serial assessments of social determinants of health in a cohort stratified by both education and Black versus White race. Trajectory analyses examining structural factors, including wealth, employment status, single parenthood, neighborhood\u2010level determinants, and access to health care, during a time of economic change (1985\u2010present), policies, and social support networks for postdelivery care and relationships with a broad range of CVD outcomes are possible; such analyses have been performed to some extent for Black and White participants overall but not by both race and sex. These issues affect women and men differently, and comparisons by sex could be conducted. The CARDIA study has recently reported that the higher risk of premature CVD in Black versus White adults was statistically explained by clinical and neighborhood factors in women, compared with clinical and socioeconomic factors in men.  7  Such factors include mental health, discrimination, and substance use, which have been collected repeatedly in the CARDIA study and whose relationship with reproductive milestones could provide rich areas for exploration.  Comparisons between Black and White women of trajectories of social determinants of health and how these interact with reproductive milestones should also be examined. Specifically, how disparities in CVD risk factors in Black versus White women are influenced by reproductive disparities could be examined more closely. Although it is a plausible hypothesis that higher\u2010risk reproductive milestones are associated with poorer social determinants of health and CVD risk factors, which, in turn, influence future reproductive outcomes and CVD outcomes, such lifecourse analysis has not been conducted. Such analyses have the potential to influence not only epidemiologic analyses but also health policies. For example, the examination of the impact of single parenthood on cardiovascular health has been limited, because of inadequate data on cardiovascular risk before and after parenthood, whether such parenthood was modified by divorce and social support systems, and potential mediators, such as lifestyle behaviors and access to health care. Exploring these questions in the CARDIA study along with other observational studies would increase representativeness as well as statistical power.  Comprehensive reproductive life course models that take into account the correlations between fertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and VMS may have greater impact than models considering only one of these dimensions (Figure 3 ). In particular, the linkages between adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, early age at menopause, and presence of VMS, may confer a particularly high\u2010risk CVD profile. Another high\u2010risk grouping may be represented by PCOS, GDM, and absence of lactation, which would be of value to examine because of lactation as a potentially modifiable behavior that might ameliorate CVD risk. Combining CARDIA study data with other observational studies would increase statistical power.  The CARDIA study has collected information on COVID\u201019 infection and vaccination. As the cohort ages, the next wave of data collection involves collection of data relevant to aging. Future studies might examine the relationship between reproductive events on cognition, fitness, and aging metrics. Ancillary studies have already characterized lung function, sleep apnea, cardiometabolic disease, as well as cognitive functioning, bone markers, and physical functioning. Linkages between reproductive exposures with epigenetic, genetic, and metabolomic markers that have already been measured in CARDIA study subsets have not been fully explored. Thus, the contribution of reproductive milestones to these other aspects of health will be possible as the cohort ages.
