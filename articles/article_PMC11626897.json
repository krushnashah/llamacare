    "body": "I NTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most widespread endocrine-metabolic disorder frequently occurring in reproductive-aged women.[ 1 ] It is distinguished by symptoms that include polycystic ovaries, irregular menstrual cycle, and hyperandrogenism.[ 2 ] During different phases of life, the phenotype of PCOS changes, enabling the syndrome to develop from a reproductive disorder into a metabolic disease.[ 3 ] The first-degree female relatives of women with PCOS also suffer from the disease.[ 4 ] Patients with PCOS who are undergoing infertility treatment have a much higher rate of problems, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and early pregnancy loss due to ovulation induction.[ 5 ] Infertility affects 70%\u201380% of women with PCOS, primarily because of ovulatory dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying PCOS-associated infertility are not yet clear. Many factors could be responsible for PCOS-associated infertility, and one of them could be impaired endometrial implantation.[ 6 ]  Current advances have identified several susceptible genes of PCOS, such as Vitamin D receptor (VDR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), estrogen receptor 1 , CYP1A1 CYP11A, CYP17A1, CYP19, HSD17B, AR, SHB, INSR, IRS, interleukin (IL)-1B, and IL-6 .[ 7 ] The VDR gene on chromosome 12q13.11 consists of 14 exons and 427 amino acids.[ 8 ] The four mainly reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) include TaqI (rs731236) in exon 9, BsmI (rs1544410) in intron 8, ApaI (rs7975232) in intron 8, and FokI (rs10735810) in exon 2.[ 9 ] Since TaqI and BsmI are present very close to the 3\u2032-UTR region, they are mainly involved in mRNA stability and posttranscriptional operations.[ 10 ]  ADIPOQ is a gene on chromosome 3q27 consisting of three exons and 2 introns. It is highly heritable and is often associated with obesity and diabetes-related complications.[ 11 ] The two commonly observed SNPs are T45G (rs2241766) in exon 2 and G276T (rs1501299) in intron 2. Although these two polymorphisms are ideal genetic biomarkers of PCOS, some studies\u2019 results are still controversial.[ 12 ] This study aims to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis to improve the precision of evaluating the association between VDR and ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and their potential influence on PCOS susceptibility, addressing inconsistencies in hereditary predisposition studies influenced by factors such as ethnicity, gender, and sample size.    M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS  The meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. The research protocol has been registered on the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/63bhj ). The study exclusively utilized data from published articles and did not involve ethical concerns.[ 13 ]   Search strategy  We conducted an online electronic database search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Research Gate to gather relevant articles published between 2013 and July 2023. The search strategy was built around the terms \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d or \u201cPCOS,\u201d \u201cpolymorphisms,\u201d \u201cadiponectin\u201d or \u201cADIPOQ,\u201d and \u201crs1544410\u201d to retrieve complete articles written in English. Additionally, we manually examined each retrieved article to ensure we did not miss any relevant publications during the electronic search.    Eligibility criteria  A selection of the articles obtained underwent a curation process following specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria involve (a) a case\u2013control study, (b) the availability of genotypic frequency data, and (c) research on the association of the reviewed polymorphism with PCOS. Some retrieved articles were excluded on the following basis: (a) studies lacking genotypic frequency data, (b) studies on animal models, (c) studies with no control subjects, and (d) review articles.    Quality score assessment  The Newcastle\u2013Ottawa scale evaluated the risk assessment of bias. The scale consists of three features: selection, exposure, and comparison based on five parameters that include the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) index, cases, controls, association assessment, and genotyping method. The maximum score for the evaluation is 11, and studies with at least a score of 8 were recognized as high quality.    Data extraction  All relevant articles were collected independently by the investigators without any disagreements. The studies have extracted several data, including the author\u2019s name, the year of publication, ethnic background, country of origin, the number of samples collected (both cases and controls), diagnostic criteria, and genotypic frequencies. The frequencies for the selected studies were analyzed using the HWE and the P value analysis.    Statistical analysis  We calculated crude odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the relationship between gene polymorphisms and PCOS. Specifically, we assessed the TaqI polymorphism using four different genetic models: allele contrast (T vs. C), codominant models (CT to CC and TT to CC genotypes), a recessive model (comparing TT to CC + CT genotypes), and a dominant model (corresponding CT + TT to CC genotypes). Likewise, genetic models were calculated for other gene polymorphisms such as rs2241766, rs1501299, rs1544410, and rs2234693. The probability of PCOS was also analyzed using ethnicity, case and control design, diagnostic criteria, and HWE index. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the I 2 test, which was acceptable only if the value of I 2 was <50.[ 14 ]  We computed crude ORs with corresponding 95% CIs to assess the association between gene polymorphisms and PCOS. We examined four genetic models: allele contrast (T vs. C), codominant models (CT to CC and TT to CC genotypes), a recessive model (TT vs. CC + CT genotypes), and a dominant model (CT + TT vs. CC genotypes), for the selected gene polymorphisms (rs2241766, rs1501299, rs1544410, and rs2234693). PCOS probability was further analyzed based on ethnicity, case and control design, diagnostic criteria, and HWE index. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 test, with acceptability set at I 2 <50.[ 14 ] In other respects, we adopted the random effect model based on the DerSimonian and Laird method.  Publication bias was assessed via Begg\u2019s funnel plot and Egger\u2019s linear regression, with the asymmetry examining plot asymmetry on a natural log scale.[ 15 ] Sensitivity analysis evaluated the impact of this bias on result robustness. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using STATA version 12.0 software (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA), and statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.     R ESULTS   Characteristics of eligible studies  This meta-analysis employed the PRISMA guidelines, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Initially, we conducted a comprehensive search across various electronic databases, yielding a total of 4718 articles. Of these, 4685 were excluded for reasons such as lacking genotypic frequency data, consisting of reviews, or not about the specified gene polymorphisms. We incorporated 33 articles into the meta-analysis, which covered a combined count of 5677 cases and 5257 controls.

VDR is essential in absorption and metabolic processes. However, the results of specific studies are also contradicting, stating that it could be because of ethnicity and clinical samples. Hence, the investigation conducted by Luana et al . concluded that the polymorphism of rs731236 was found to be associated with PCOS in Brazilian women.[ 22 ] In contrast, the attempt carried out by Ibrahim et al . revealed that the association is found to be insignificant.[ 23 ]  Generally, the GG genotype of BsmI polymorphism (rs1544410), located in the 3\u2032-UTR region, was the least recurring in women with PCOS. Furthermore, the GG carriers had low levels of SHBG rather than AA carriers, which showed no difference in the allelic and genotypic frequencies between controls and cases. Despite these controversial results, the study carried out by Luana et al . was observed to be associated.[ 22 ] If ethnicity is considered, the polymorphism was reported more frequent in the Egyptian population than the Caucasians.[ 23 ] It is demonstrated that the association was found in our meta-analysis.  Recent studies have linked ADIPOQ polymorphisms with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysregulation, and the polymorphism for rs2241766 showed no significant association in the Saudi Arabian population.[ 31 ] Significantly, it is demonstrated that the association was found in our meta-analysis. The result found for rs1501299 is found to be very similar to the effects of rs2241766. Correspondingly, our impact is also identical to the previous studies.[ 31 32 ]  Several studies have been published to date that have investigated the possible link between VDR gene ApaI polymorphism and PCOS development; nevertheless, the findings from various investigations have been inconsistent and contradictory. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to obtain summary estimates for the strength of the link between VDR and ADIPOQ gene polymorphisms and PCOS risk from seven case\u2013control studies. When compared to controls, our novel findings on gene model analysis were significantly connected in PCOS women. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these associations is unknown. Previously, Mahmoudi et al . discovered a connection between ApaI polymorphisms and PCOS risk. Dasgupta et al . earlier stated that no VDR gene polymorphisms were discovered.[ 18 38 ]  Several factors should be considered when conducting a meta-analysis. As a starting point, earlier experiments have shown that mutant alleles of the investigated polymorphisms are related to decreased ADIPOQ production, which may explain some of our results. Secondly, due to the complex pathogenic mechanism of PCOS, a single-gene variation is unlikely to have an important role in its development. Due to these findings, we strongly recommend that future research conduct haplotype analyses and investigate potential gene\u2013gene interactions to establish possible links between individual gene polymorphisms and PCOS. It is essential to acknowledge the limitations inherent in this study, as is customary in all meta-analyses.[ 39 40 ] Our investigation revealed notable variations in subgroups, indicating that the diverse outcomes observed in the included studies cannot be solely attributed to differences in ethnicity. It is plausible that various baseline participant characteristics may also contribute to these discrepancies. PCOS risk may be influenced by interactions between ADIPOQ and VDR polymorphisms and genes and the environment. Even though the majority of qualifying studies did not account for these interactions, a more thorough analysis was not possible. Therefore, our findings should be viewed carefully in light of the limitations noted.    C ONCLUSION  The relationship between gene polymorphisms and PCOS is a complex and growing research area. The development of PCOS has been associated with several gene polymorphisms, although the research findings have been conflicting. In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the genetic associations between VDR and ADIPOQ, polymorphisms, and PCOS susceptibility. Although certain essential connections have been found, further research is necessary to validate these findings and unravel the complex genetic underpinnings of PCOS. Understanding these genetic factors could improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individuals with PCOS.
