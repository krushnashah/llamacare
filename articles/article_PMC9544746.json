    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterised by androgen excess (hyperandrogenism), ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovary morphology (Ehrmann, 2005 ). PCOS affects 8\u201313% of reproductive\u2010aged women worldwide (Bozdag et\u00a0al., 2016 ) and is associated with a number of morbidities including subfertility, insulin resistance (Cassar et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Stepto et\u00a0al., 2013 ), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Moran et\u00a0al., 2010 ), psychological disorders (depression and anxiety) (Cooney et\u00a0al., 2017 ), an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Kakoly et\u00a0al., 2019 ) and endometrial cancer (Dumesic & Lobo, 2013 ). While the aetiology of PCOS remains to be established, there are a number of proposed contributing factors such as genetic, environmental, circulating and in utero developmental programming factors (Franks et\u00a0al., 2008 ; Sir\u2010Petermann et\u00a0al., 2002 ; Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ; V\u00e1zquez\u2010Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Lifestyle intervention is a first\u2010line therapy for women with PCOS to manage clinical features at the metabolic, reproductive and psychological level (Teede et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Exercise is a key component of this lifestyle intervention (Stepto, Patten et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Teede et\u00a0al., 2018 ), inducing improvements in metabolic health. In particular, some of the exercise\u2010induced molecular adaptations in skeletal muscle result in improvement in insulin sensitivity, increases in muscle mass, vascularisation, glucose transport and metabolism, and mitochondrial content (Egan & Zierath, 2013 ; Sylow & Richter, 2019 ). It has, however, been proposed that women with PCOS display an impaired response to exercise on metabolic health (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Harrison et\u00a0al., 2012 ). Overweight women with PCOS display lesser improvements in insulin sensitivity compared to BMI\u2010matched controls in response to 12\u00a0weeks of high intensity interval training (Harrison et\u00a0al., 2012 ). Additionally, 14\u00a0weeks of mixed modality exercise training failed to improve glucose uptake, insulin signalling or peripheral blood flow in lean hyperandrogenic women with PCOS (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2020 ). However, the precise mechanisms associated with the lack of such exercise\u2010induced metabolic improvements remain elusive.  One of the numerous factors which could contribute to abnormal exercise responses in women with PCOS is the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signalling pathway. Dysregulated TGF\u03b2 signalling has been linked to the pathophysiology of PCOS, and in particular to the development of ovarian fibrosis and reproductive defects (Hatzirodos et\u00a0al., 2011 ; Raja\u2010Khan et\u00a0al., 2014 ), and has been suggested to also affect peripheral tissues. Of interest, women with PCOS have elevated circulating levels of the TGF\u03b2 family ligands TGF\u03b21 and anti\u2010M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) (Cassar et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Irani et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Raja\u2010Khan et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Sumbul et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Tal et\u00a0al., 2013 ). To the best of our knowledge, only one study to date conducted by our group has examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 signalling in skeletal muscle of women with PCOS (Stepto et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  In individuals with T2DM, the mechanism behind reduced improvements in insulin sensitivity after exercise training has been attributed to TGF\u03b21 (B\u00f6hm et\u00a0al., 2016 ). Low responders to exercise training have greater TGF\u03b21 activity, resulting in the suppression of AMP\u2010activated protein kinase \u03b12 (AMPK\u03b12), ATP synthase subunit \u03b1, peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), key factors of the exercise\u2010induced metabolic regulation (B\u00f6hm et\u00a0al., 2016 ). A role of TGF\u03b2 signalling has also been proposed in women with PCOS following high\u2010intensity exercise training, where exercise did not fully restore insulin sensitivity to levels comparable to overweight controls after the exercise training (Stepto et\u00a0al., 2020 ). This modest effect of exercise was accompanied by an increased profibrotic gene expression profile associated with TGF\u03b2 signalling (Stepto et\u00a0al., 2020 ), suggesting an effect of TGF\u03b2 signalling in exercise\u2010induced adaptations.  Electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) represents an in vitro model of contraction in human primary and C2C12\u00a0myotubes (Nikoli\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2017 ). EPS increases the gene expression of myosin heavy chain 7 ( Myh7) and 2 ( Myh2) , and induces the expression of contraction\u2010induced signal transduction proteins in primary myotubes similar to the in vivo exercise response (Son et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Thus, EPS is considered an appropriate in vitro model to study the molecular responses to muscle contraction, and to explore how cell\u2010autonomous factors influence these contraction\u2010induced responses.  The present study sought to identify skeletal muscle pathways that may explain the aberrant responses to exercise observed in women with PCOS, and to determine whether TGF\u03b2 signalling plays a role in the altered response. We investigated the impact of two TGF\u03b2 ligands, TGF\u03b21 and AMH, on contraction\u2010induced adaptations by applying in vitro EPS to myotubes from women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. We hypothesised that myotubes from women with PCOS would present with a different exercise\u2010induced signature and that TGF\u03b2 signalling would play a major role in this adaptation.    Methods   Ethical approval  This study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki , except for registration in a database. Participants included in this study were part of the TGF\u03b2\u2010PCOS trial (ACTRN12618000155291) and the iHIT\u2010PCOS trial (ACTRN12615000242527): https://www.anzctr.org.au/ (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry). Ethical approval was obtained from the Victoria University Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference HRE17\u2010232), and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.    Participants  Six overweight women with PCOS (body mass index (BMI) >25\u00a0kg/m 2 ) and six lean (BMI <25\u00a0kg/m 2 ) healthy women, all Caucasian, premenopausal and aged between 18 and 40 years, were included in this study (Supporting information Table S1 ). PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam Criteria (The Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2004), and confirmed by an endocrinologist. The Rotterdam criteria required confirmation of two of the following: (i) oligo\u2010 or anovulation; (ii) clinical (hirsutism) and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and (iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and exclusion of other causes of hyperandrogenism. The healthy control group consisted of women without any features of PCOS. The exclusion criteria included menopause or perimenopause, secondary causes of menstrual disturbance, pregnancy, smoking, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension (>160/100\u00a0mmHg), cardiovascular disease, established cardiovascular disease and use of medications that interfere with endpoints. All clinical measures and testing, including body composition assessment by dual energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (iDXA GE Lunar Prodigy scanner; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and euglycaemic\u2013hyperinsulinaemic clamps to assess insulin sensitivity were conducted after an overnight fast and in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (days 1\u20137) for those participants with regular menstrual cycles, following the methods previously described (Moreno\u2010Asso et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Cardiorespiratory fitness level ( V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) of all participants was assessed as previously described (Patten et\u00a0al., 2022 ).    Muscle biopsies and primary myotube cultures  A muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis using the modified Bergstrom technique (Bergstr\u00f6m, 1975 ; Shanely et\u00a0al., 2014 ) after an overnight fast. Following collection, approximately 40\u201350\u00a0mg of muscle was minced into small pieces (<1\u20132\u00a0mm 3 ), enzymatically dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin\u2010EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Melbourne, Australia) and satellite cells selected using CD56 + magnetic beads as described previously (Agley et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Cells were cultured in growth medium (\u03b1\u2010minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.5% v/v penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 0.5% v/v amphotericin B) in coated flasks/plates with extracellular matrix gel (Geltrex LDEV\u2010Free Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Matrix, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Once cells reached 80% confluency, they were differentiated for 5\u00a0days in six\u2010well plates using differentiation medium (\u03b1\u2010MEM with 2% v/v horse serum, 0.5% v/v penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 0.5% v/v amphotericin B) before starting the treatments.    TGF\u03b2 ligand treatments  To determine if the circulating factors TGF\u03b21 and AMH differently influence human primary myotube responses to in vitro EPS, the following six conditions were applied for 16\u00a0h in serum\u2010free normal glucose media (\u03b1\u2010MEM with 0.5% v/v penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 0.5% v/v amphotericin B): (i) non\u2010treated control (no treatment and no EPS); (ii) TGF\u03b21 (5\u00a0ng/ml); (iii) AMH (30\u00a0ng/ml); (iv) EPS; (v) EPS+TGF\u03b21 (5\u00a0ng/ml), and (vi) EPS+AMH (30\u00a0ng/ml) (Fig. 1 ).   Figure 1   Schematic representation of the study design         Electrical pulse stimulation  Following the treatment, medium was removed and cells washed twice with phosphate\u2010buffered saline and then placed in serum\u2010free medium (\u03b1\u2010MEM with 0.5% v/v penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 0.5% v/v amphotericin B). Human primary myotubes were then stimulated with EPS using the C\u2010Pace EP multichannel Culture Pacer (IonOptix, Milton, MA, USA) (Fig. 1 ), using a chronic low\u2010frequency stimulation protocol of 11.5 V, 2\u00a0ms, 1\u00a0Hz for 6\u00a0h or remained unstimulated in serum\u2010free medium for 6\u00a0h. This EPS protocol has been shown to activate exercise\u2010like induced signal transduction improving glucose metabolism, promoting the secretion of myokines and causing structural changes in the myotubes (Nikoli\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2017 ).    RNA sequencing  Immediately following the 6 h treatment, total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA universal kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of total RNA samples (500\u00a0ng) was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit and Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared according to Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA with the Ribo\u2010Zero Gold protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described (Moreno\u2010Asso et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for quantification of libraries, and quality control for base pair size and purity was examined using an Agilent high\u2010sensitivity DNA chip and Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina).    Bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing data  RNA\u2010seq reads ( n \u2248\u00a036.8 m ) from FASTQ files were aligned using STAR (v2.7.2b) aligner (Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013 ) with Ensembl (Cunningham et\u00a0al., 2019 ) human annotation (GRCh38, release 98) resulting in 28 m reads on average (Supporting information, Fig. S1 ). One library (sample: P_c_EPS_A30_26) was excluded from downstream analysis due to low read number ( n =\u00a0137). Gene coverages were counted using featureCounts (Liao et\u00a0al., 2014 ) ( n \u2248\u00a023.7) from the subread (v1.6.2) package. Genes with low expression were removed using the filterByExpr function from the edgeR package (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2009 ) (v3.28.1), and thereby 19,231 genes were considered for differential expression analysis. A generalised linear model (GLM), 0 + group (group is defined by merging experimental conditions \u2018Disease\u2019, \u2018EPS\u2010treatment\u2019 and \u2018hormone\u2010treatment\u2019), was fitted by edgeR's (v3.32.1) voomLmFit function while blocking for participants in order to calculate differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were generated by using batch (participant ID) corrected logCPM values using the removeBatchEffect function from the edgeR package.    Pathway enrichment analysis  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed by using clusterProfiler (Yu et\u00a0al., 2012 ) (v3.14.3) and Reactome database (ReactomePA R package (Yu & He, 2016 ), v1.30.10) with log 2\u2010fold changes (logFC) calculated by the differential expression analysis. The REACTOME ontology terms with less than 10 and more than 500 genes were removed from the analysis. REACTOME ontology terms with q \u2010value <0.05 were considered as enriched. The ontology terms with the genes were plotted as a network, CNET plots, with selected REACTOME ontology terms shown using the cnetplot function from the clusterProfiler package.    Cluster analysis of expression patterns  To identify the similar gene expression patterns, the batch corrected logCPM values (see \u2018Bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing data\u2019) were z \u2010score transformed across libraries, excluding AMH treated ones, and the average z \u2010score was calculated by group. The Clust algorithm (v1.10.10) (Abu\u2010Jamous & Kelly, 2018 ) was used to calculate the similar gene clusters, which resulted in 12 distinct clusters. The enriched gene ontology (GO) molecular function (MF) and biological process (BP) terms for the gene clusters 2 and 4, respectively, were identified by using over\u2010representation analysis with a q \u2010value cut\u2010off below 0.05. Displayed GO terms were filtered using SimRel semantic similarity with a value of C =\u00a00.5 to eliminate redundancy and prepared for visualisation using the REViGO tool (Supek et\u00a0al., 2011 ; available online at http://revigo.irb.hr/) .    Quantitative reverse transcription\u2013PCR  Extracted mRNA was reverse transcribed using Bio\u2010Rad iScript RT Supermix (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and a Thermocycler (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories). Quantitative reverse transcription\u2013PCR (qRT\u2010PCR) reactions were performed in duplicate using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories) and run in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex Real\u2010Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Specific qRT\u2010PCR forward and reverse primers were used for the amplification of selected genes (Table 1 ). Gene expression results were normalised using the geometric mean of the selected three most stable housekeeping genes ( PPIA (cyclophilin), B2M , GAPDH ) out of five analysed ( TBP , ACTB , PPIA , B2M , GAPDH ), using RefFinder ( https://www.heartcure.com.au/reffinder/ ).

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.      Statistical analyses  Statistical analysis for qRT\u2010PCR gene expression was performed by two\u2010way repeated measures of ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. Factors were group (CTRL, healthy controls; and PCOS, women with PCOS) and treatment (non\u2010treated control, TGF\u03b21 treatment, AMH treatment, EPS treatment, and EPS+TGF\u03b21 treatment groups). This analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software version 8.2.1 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).     Results   EPS induces a greater gene expression response in myotubes from women with PCOS  Compared to the control group, women with PCOS showed profound insulin resistance and dysregulated hormonal expression including hyperandrogenism (Supporting information Table S1 ). As these clinical features may influence skeletal muscle signalling in response to exercise, we aimed to assess changes in the myotube transcriptome in response to contraction in primary muscle cells from both women with PCOS and healthy controls using low\u2010frequency EPS. An MDS plot of RNA\u2010seq data displayed a clear separation by group (PCOS vs . healthy) and by EPS treatment (Fig. 2 A  ), the latter being more apparent in myotubes from women with PCOS compared to myotubes from healthy women. We identified a total of 19\u00a0231 transcripts where 173 were differentially expressed following EPS in myotubes from healthy women (83 upregulated and 90 downregulated; FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 4719 differentially expressed (2419 upregulated and 2300 downregulated; FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in myotubes from women with PCOS (Fig. 2 B  and Supporting information Dataset S1 ). GSEA using Reactome pathways database showed upregulation of genes involved in skeletal muscle contraction in both groups following EPS in first 20 enriched terms ranked by normalised enrichment score (NES) (Fig. 2 C  and Supporting information Dataset S2 ). Only in myotubes from women with PCOS, genes related to interleukin (IL)\u201010 signalling, extracellular ligands and chemokine binding, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were upregulated following EPS, while genes related to androgen receptor signalling, oxidative stress\u2010induced senescence and epigenetic regulation of both DNA methylation and histone acetylation were downregulated (Fig. 2 D  ). Relevant genes included in the IL\u201010 signalling and chemokines pathways are CXCL10 , TNF , IL1A , CXCL8 , CCL20 , PTGS2 , CX3CL1 , LIF , IL6 and CSF3 , which were all highly induced following EPS (log 2\u2010fold change greater than 1.6) (Fig. 2 D  and Supporting information Dataset S2 ). In contrast, myotubes from healthy women displayed a downregulation of genes related to several inflammatory pathways and immune responses after EPS treatment amongst the top 20 downregulated enriched terms (Fig. 2 C  and Supporting information Dataset S2 ). These results show that myotubes from women with PCOS display a greater responsiveness to EPS compared to myotubes from healthy women and support a pro\u2010inflammatory response after muscle contraction in PCOS.

D , CNET plots showing selected significantly enriched Reactome ontology terms after EPS treatment within five selected upregulated and downregulated pathways, respectively, in myotubes from women with PCOS.       TGF\u03b21 upregulates genes related to extracellular matrix remodelling and reduces the expression of contractile genes in myotubes  To understand if elevated levels of TGF\u03b2 ligands could negatively affect skeletal muscle as observed in the reproductive tissues, we assessed changes in the transcriptomic profile in human primary myotubes following 16\u00a0h treatment with TGF\u03b21 or AMH. MDS plot of RNA\u2010seq data showed a marked separation by TGF\u03b21 but no effect of AMH treatment on myotubes from both women with PCOS and healthy controls (Fig. 3 A  ). We detected 1682 upregulated and 1500 downregulated genes (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in myotubes from healthy women following treatment with TGF\u03b21 (Fig. 3 B  and Supporting information Dataset S3 ). Similarly, in myotubes from women with PCOS there were 1456 upregulated and 1187 downregulated genes (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) following TGF\u03b21 treatment (Fig. 3 B  ). GSEA using the Reactome pathways showed upregulation of genes related to extracellular matrix remodelling, collagen synthesis and TGF\u03b2 signalling in both groups following TGF\u03b21 treatment (Fig. 3 C  and Supporting information, Dataset S4 ). In addition, TGF\u03b21 treatment resulted in the suppression of genes related to muscle contraction and NOTCH signalling in both groups (Fig. 3 C  ). TGF\u03b21 treatment induced downregulation of genes associated to IL\u20106\u2010type receptor ligand interactions and activation of matrix metalloproteinases and extra\u2010nuclear oestrogen signalling only in myotubes derived from women with PCOS (Fig. 3 C  ). Differential expression of a selection of genes ( ACTA1 , MYL2 , COL10A1 and COL7A1 ) from relevant enriched terms was validated by qRT\u2010PCR (Fig. 3 D  ). Altogether, these results suggest that TGF\u03b21 reprograms skeletal muscle cell cultures towards a less differentiated phenotype.

TGF\u03b21 inhibits the EPS\u2010induced increase in genes related to myotube contractile functions  To test the hypothesis that TGF\u03b21 interferes with contraction\u2010induced gene expression adaptations in muscle cells in PCOS, we examined the effects of TGF\u03b21 \u00a0on the EPS\u00a0treatment of primary myotubes from both women with PCOS and healthy controls. Differential gene expression detected with TGF\u03b21 and EPS compared with EPS alone in both groups was similar (healthy controls: 2003 upregulated and 1908 downregulated genes, FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05; and PCOS: 1465 upregulated and 1023 downregulated, FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) (Fig. 4 A  and Supporting information Dataset S5 ). A selection of differentially expressed genes, ACTA1 , MYL2 , TNNC2 , IGF1 , COL10A1 and COL7A1 , was validated by qRT\u2010PCR (Fig. 4 B  ).

EPS.     To get functional insight into the effect of TGF\u03b21 on the gene expression changes induced by in vitro contraction in human primary myotubes, we performed both GSEA and cluster analysis. GSEA showed an upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodelling and unfolded protein response/endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and a downregulation of genes related to muscle contraction in both PCOS and healthy control groups (Fig. 4 C  and Supporting information Dataset S6 ). In addition, myotubes derived from women with PCOS displayed an upregulation of genes related to DNA methylation and histone acetylation, and a downregulation of genes related to GPCR signalling and fatty acid metabolism, which was not observed in the healthy control group (Fig. 4 C  ). Cluster analysis revealed 12 groups of genes with similar expression pattern (Fig. 5 A  and Supporting information Dataset S7 ). We identified three clusters of genes, labelled 2, 4 and 11, whose expression was activated by EPS but were downregulated when TGF\u03b21 treatment was added in both primary myotubes from women with PCOS and healthy controls (Fig. 5 A  ). Conversely, expression of genes in clusters 3, 6 and 9 was higher when TGF\u03b21 was added to the EPS (Fig. 5 A  ). Consistent with our GSEA findings of the RNA\u2010seq data, over\u2010representation analysis of these clusters using gene ontology, biological processes (GO:BP) or molecular function (GO:MF), respectively, revealed that genes in cluster 2 were involved in SMAD/activin signalling and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) binding (Fig. 5 B  and Supporting information Dataset S8 ), while genes in cluster 4 were related to muscle contraction, muscle development and myotube differentiation, actin\u2010filament based movement, and cellular calcium ion transport (Fig. 5 C  and Supporting information Dataset S8 ). No enriched pathways were found for genes in clusters 3, 6, 9 and 11. Collectively, these results show that the presence of TGF\u03b21 during muscle contraction affects the normal gene expression response such as pathways controlling intracellular signalling and constituents of the contraction apparatus.

Discussion  Here, we have used an EPS model of in vitro muscle contraction to map the transcriptomic response to contraction in primary myotubes from women with PCOS compared to that in healthy controls, and also examined the effect of TGF\u03b21 and AMH. We show that primary myotubes from women with PCOS display a greater responsiveness to EPS with a large pro\u2010inflammatory response compared to healthy control women. Our results show that TGF\u03b21, but not AMH, alters the response to EPS by impairing contractile functions in primary myotubes from both groups of women and uniquely affects different pathways in each group.  Exercise activates inflammatory related pathways in human skeletal muscle, which promotes tissue repair and adaptation (Louis et\u00a0al., 2007 ; Peake et\u00a0al., 2017 ; Powers & Jackson, 2008 ). In our in vitro contraction model, we found that following EPS, the expression genes related to IL\u201010\u00a0signalling and chemokines was increased in myotubes from women with PCOS. In contrast, we did not see this response in myotubes from healthy women, despite EPS having previously been shown to induce the expression of genes related to interleukin and chemokine signalling in primary myotubes from healthy subjects (Raschke et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Scheler et\u00a0al., 2013 ). This signalling has been associated in vivo with increased secretion of myokines, such as CX3CL1 and CCL2, involved in exercise adaptive processes such as tissue repair and hypertrophy (Catoire et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Hoffmann & Weigert, 2017 ; Raschke et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Scheler et\u00a0al., 2013 ). In response to EPS in myotubes from healthy women, we also observed a reduction in inflammatory related pathways including IL\u20104 and IL\u201013\u00a0signalling pathways. Genes associated with these pathways are linked with TNF\u03b1 signalling, fibrosis and immune responses (Distler et\u00a0al., 2019 ). In line with this, it has been previously shown that 8\u00a0h of EPS of myotubes from healthy subjects produces an anti\u2010inflammatory effect by preventing TNF\u03b1\u2010induced inflammatory signalling (Lambernd et\u00a0al., 2012 ). Thus, the pro\u2010inflammatory response to contraction of myotubes derived from women with PCOS may be a pathophysiological feature of PCOS aggravating a maladaptive response to exercise.  Comparing the gene expression response to contraction between PCOS and controls, we also observed a reduction in the expression of genes related to androgen signalling and epigenetic regulation by EPS in primary myotubes from women with PCOS. Consistent with the described hyperandrogenism in PCOS, an upregulation of androgen receptor signalling genes has been observed in the skeletal muscle of women with PCOS (Manti et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Remarkably, following exercise training, women with PCOS exhibit a reduction in free androgen index and total testosterone levels (Patten et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Our study, therefore, highlights a potential effect of muscle contraction by regulating androgen receptor signalling and thus supporting the role of exercise in improving hyperandrogenism. Of note, we found that the androgen receptor signalling pathway was downregulated in myotubes from women with PCOS following EPS. The associated ontology term included core histone genes ( H2A , H2B , H3B , H3C , H4 and H4C ) which were shared across other downregulated terms associated with cellular senescence, DNA methylation and histone acetylation. In line with our findings, exercise\u2010induced DNA hypomethylation has already been shown to occur immediately post\u2010exercise in skeletal muscle (Barr\u00e8s et\u00a0al., 2012 ), with a similar response occurring in myotubes following EPS (Pattamaprapanont et\u00a0al., 2016 ). Although our analysis was conducted in primary myotubes that were lysed immediately after EPS, we only observed this decrease in genes related to DNA methylation in myotubes derived from women with PCOS and not in those from healthy women. The downregulation of genes related to histone acetylation has also been reported to occur in response to metabolic stress in C2C12\u00a0myotubes (Jo et\u00a0al., 2020 ), and has been suggested to promote expression of genes related to cell survival, whilst downregulating genes related to cellular functions that require large amounts of energy (Jo et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Total histone 3 (H3) gene and protein expression are downregulated in skeletal muscle following acute resistance exercise, contributing to the dissembling of nucleosomes to allow transcriptional activation (Lim et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Together with our data, evidence from the literature suggests that muscle contraction induces a greater metabolic stress and more disrupted oxidative homeostasis in PCOS compared to controls, resulting in the regulation of histones and epigenetic factors to favour cell adaptations through the regulation of transcription.  The differential gene expression profile in response to EPS between myotubes from women with PCOS and healthy controls in our study may not only be explained by the presence of intrinsic PCOS mechanisms but also associated, in part, to other retained characteristics from the in vivo phenotype, such as the fitness/training level of the donors (Bourlier et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Indeed, in our study, women with PCOS had significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels ( V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) compared to healthy control women (Supporting information Table S1 ). Thus, a potential mechanism for the lack of gene expression plasticity may be through the existence of a skeletal muscle epigenetic memory from previous exercise training (Seaborne et\u00a0al., 2018 ). However, we have previously shown that skeletal muscle\u2010derived myotubes from women with PCOS do not retain in vivo impairments in energy metabolism or the altered expression of genes related to mitochondrial function, which are associated to exercise\u2010induced adaptations (Moreno\u2010Asso et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Thus, a limitation of this study is the lack of an additional control group of myotubes from sedentary overweight women, which may have allowed for better identification of the differences that occur due to PCOS, excluding the influence of different fitness levels and obesity.  We also determined if elevated levels of TGF\u03b21 or AMH, similar to those observed in vivo in women with PCOS, would influence basal and EPS\u2010induced gene expression. We previously proposed that AMH, which is associated with peripheral insulin resistance in women with PCOS, might be involved in tissue cross\u2010talk to influence skeletal muscle metabolism (Nardo et\u00a0al., 2009 ; Sahmay et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Stepto, Moreno\u2010Asso et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Wiweko & Susanto, 2017 ). However, treatment with AMH did not affect gene expression in primary myotubes from either healthy women or women with PCOS in our study. Thus, our data indicate that AMH does not play a direct role in muscle metabolism or exercise\u2010induced metabolic adaptations, at least in a cell autonomous system, despite its involvement in reproductive defects and proposed role in whole\u2010body insulin resistance in women with PCOS (Wiweko et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  In contrast to the lack of transcriptional alterations by AMH, TGF\u03b21 induced robust and similar responses in the gene expression profile of myotubes from both healthy women and women with PCOS despite intrinsic differences between donor groups, such as the presence of obesity. TGF\u03b21 increased gene expression of several extracellular matrix\u2010related pathways, which can be linked to adverse tissue remodelling such as fibrosis and muscle pathologies (Ismaeel et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Typically, TGF\u03b21 and tissue fibrosis are associated with increased collagen accumulation, in particular collagens 1 and 3 (Williams et\u00a0al., 2015 ). However, our data show an increase after TGF\u03b21 treatment of gene expression of collagens 7 and 10 ( COL7A1 and COL10A1 ), which act as anchoring fibrils and network\u2010forming collagens, respectively (Kaur & Reinhardt, 2015 ). These findings are consistent with our previous data showing no change in collagens 1 and 3 in primary myotubes treated with TGF\u03b21 (McIlvenna et\u00a0al., 2021 ). This atypical response may be related to the 2D cell culture set\u2010up, which does not fully capture the structural and dynamic complexities of the extracellular matrix in vivo (Li & Kilian, 2015 ; Nicolas et\u00a0al., 2020 ). We and others have previously shown that skeletal muscle and cultured myotubes derived from women with PCOS have altered transcriptomic signatures, which include upregulation of genes related to extracellular matrix remodelling and collagens (Moreno\u2010Asso et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Nilsson et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Stepto et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Thus, taking into consideration that TGF\u03b21 levels are increased in women with PCOS (Irani et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Raja\u2010khan et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Raja\u2010khan et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Tal et\u00a0al., 2013 ), findings from our study support a role of TGF\u03b21 as a casual factor for the extracellular matrix dysregulation in women with PCOS.  In the present study, we also investigated whether TGF\u03b21\u00a0may be responsible for the aberrant metabolic adaptations to exercise observed in women with PCOS (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Stepto et\u00a0al., 2020 ). We found that, regardless of the presence or absence of PCOS and intrinsic differences in the donor health status, TGF\u03b21 impairs the exercise\u2010like gene expression signature in myotubes in response to EPS by interfering with key processes related to muscle contraction, calcium transport and actin filament, which all play a role in exercise\u2010induced adaptations. This reduction in the expression of genes of the contractile apparatus was observed with TGF\u03b21 treatment alone and persisted after adding EPS. Our findings are in agreement with a recent study showing impaired muscle function induced by TGF\u03b21 injection in mice during muscle regeneration, and a disruption of genes regulating actin dynamics, affecting cell fusion/differentiation (Girardi et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Similarly, excess TGF\u03b21 in mice leads to phosphorylation of SMAD3, increased NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) gene and protein expression and reactive oxygen species production in skeletal muscle, causing muscle weakness and reducing the intracellular calcium signalling needed for muscle contraction (Waning et\u00a0al., 2015 ). In addition, excess SMAD signalling contributes to skeletal muscle and cardiac dysfunction in models of muscular dystrophy via calcium handling pathways (Goldstein et\u00a0al., 2014 ). These studies support our findings showing a substantial increase in NOX4 gene expression and SMAD signalling in myotubes from both groups after EPS when treated with TGF\u03b21. Contrary to previous findings in myotubes from T2DM subjects showing a link between TGF\u03b21 and impairments in exercise\u2010induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism (B\u00f6hm et\u00a0al., 2016 ), we did not detect any reduced expression of mitochondrial genes with TGF\u03b21 in myotubes derived from either women with PCOS or healthy controls. This suggests a distinctive effect of TGF\u03b21 in skeletal muscle of women with PCOS compared to that in individuals with T2DM.  In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the gene expression response to contraction is altered in cultured primary myotubes from women with PCOS compared to healthy controls, with an increased expression of genes related to pro\u2010inflammatory pathways in PCOS. We identified that TGF\u03b21 inhibits the gene expression response to in vitro contraction, providing further insight into the possible negative influence of TGF\u03b2 signalling on the gene expression response after exercise in PCOS. Elevated circulating levels of TGF\u03b21\u00a0may represent a mechanism by which the exercise response of skeletal muscle on gene expression plasticity is impaired in women with PCOS.
