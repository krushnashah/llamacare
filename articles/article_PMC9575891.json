    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy among women of\nreproductive age. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a metabolic disorder\nassociated with insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation. Dermcidin,\nan antimicrobial peptide, involves in insulin resistance and inflammatory\nprocesses. Dermcidin suppresses the secretion of insulin production from the\nliver/pancreas and also increases insulin resistance. We aimed to discover\nwhether dermcidin levels were altered in polycystic ovary syndrome women\ncompared to controls and determine the link of dermcidin with\nhormonal-metabolic parameters in polycystic ovary syndrome women. The current research was designed as a case-control study and Rotterdam 2003\ncriteria were used for diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome. A total of 75\nsubjects with polycystic ovary syndrome and 75 age- and body mass\nindex-matched subjects as controls were enrolled in the study. The insulin\nresistance state was determined using a homeostatic model assessment of\ninsulin resistance and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were assessed to define\ninflammation. Circulating dermcidin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay. Dermcidin levels were significantly increased in polycystic ovary\nsyndrome subjects compared to controls (172.53\u00b142.41 ng/mL vs. 108.44\u00b131.69\nng/mL, p<0.001). Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and\nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were markedly increased, whereas\nquantitative insulin sensitivity check index levels were notably decreased\nin women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared to controls. Linear\nregression analysis revealed that dermcidin exhibited an independent link\nwith homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and high-sensitivity\nC-reactive protein, whereas dermcidin displayed an inversely independent\nlink with quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. Increased dermcidin levels were associated with insulin resistance and\ninflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome women, suggesting that dermcidin\nmay play a role in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome.",
    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and heterogeneous disease, consists of\nboth reproductive and metabolic issues, and affects 10\u201315% of women in their\nreproductive age. The disease is characterized by clinical and/or laboratory\nhyperandrogenism, menstrual dysfunctions, and polycystic ovaries. The\npathophysiology of PCOS is not yet exactly clarified. A variety of mechanisms are\nconsidered to play a crucial role in the development of PCOS, including insulin\nresistance and inflammation. Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia\naffect up to 70% of women with PCOS. Besides insulin resistance, glucose and lipid\nmetabolism disorders are common in women with PCOS, along with hypertension and\nobesity, and these metabolic and endocrinological disorders show variability with\nadvancing age  1 , 2  . PCOS is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. It has been reported\nthat inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), pro-inflammatory\ncytokines, and chemokines are increased in women with PCOS  1 , 2 , 3  4  . Moreover, chronic low-grade inflammation has emerged as a key contributor to\nthe metabolic and ovarian abnormalities, including androgen excess secretion in PCOS  1  .  Dermcidin is an antimicrobial peptide that plays a crucial role in a variety of\nbiological processes involving glucose metabolism and inflammation. Dermcidin\ninduces insulin resistance. It was reported that dermcidin inhibited glucose uptake\nin the liver through the inhibition of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) synthesis\n( Figure 1 ). GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated\nglucose transporter that mediates the uptake of glucose regulated by insulin  5  . In contrast, it was reported that dermcidin inhibited insulin secretion as\nwell but the mechanistic pathway has not yet been clarified. Additionally, it was\ndemonstrated that dermcidin induces the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)  6  . Clinical data are limited regarding dermcidin, and dermcidin levels were\nfound to be elevated in subjects with hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),\nand gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  8 \u2013 11  . Common treatment strategies in PCOS subjects are based on exercise, diet,\nnutrient supplementation, and treatment of insulin resistance  12  . Currently, insulin-sensitizing agents are also used to treat such patients\nbased on their main pathophysiological substrate, hyperinsulinemia, but those\ntreatment options are not sufficent. Therefore, we investigated dermcidin levels in\nwomen with PCOS  13  .   Figure 1.   Effects of dermcidin on glucose metabolism.     We aimed to evaluate whether dermcidin levels were altered in women with PCOS\ncompared to controls and evaluate whether there were any relationships between\ndermcidin and hormonal-metabolic parameters in women with PCOS.    METHODS  Ethics committee approval was obtained from Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital\nwith decision number 29/05/2020-01. The written informed consent was taken from each\nrecruited subject. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki (revised in 2008).  A total of 75 PCOS subjects and 75 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched subjects\nwith normal menstrual cycle were recruited in this case-control study. The research\nwas conducted between July 2019 and January 2020 in the Department of Internal\nMedicine, Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital.   Polycystic ovary syndrome group  Polycystic ovary syndrome subjects were selected using Rotterdam consensus\ncriteria after excluding other causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory\ndysfunction. Although two out of three criteria are sufficient for choosing PCOS\nsubjects, we had all the three following criteria in PCOS recognition for an\nappropriate homogeneity  10  : identification of oligo- and/or anovulation, identification of\nbiochemical and/or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, and use of the\nFerriman-Gallwey [FG] for hirsutism determination  11  and occurrence of \u226512 follicles with the size of 2\u20139 mm in diameter or an\novarian volume of >10 mL (without a cyst or dominant follicle in either\novary) for determination of typical ultra-sonographic symptoms of polycystic\novaries as one ovary is sufficient for diagnosis. The subjects with FG score \u22658\nwere presented as hirsute. The biochemical hyperandrogenism was identified when\ntestosterone (normal range: 0.52\u20132.42 nmol/l), and/or dehydroepiandrosterone\nsulfate (DHEA-S) (normal range: 10\u2013248 \u03bcg/dl), and/or free androgen index (FAI)\n\u22655% of serum levels were more than the reference interval limitation  12  .    Control group  The subjects were selected among women who visited gynecology or internal medical\nclinics for a routine checkup or who were volunteers to take part in the study\nby hospital employees. The subjects of the control group had normal menstrual\ncycles without concomitant health problems, acne, hyperandrogenism, or signs of\nhirsutism.    Exclusion criteria  Apart from PCOS, the subjects having the evidence of irregularity in menstrual\ncycles and/or excess androgen, i.e., hyperprolactinemia (<22 ng/mL),\nCushing\u2019s syndrome (physical findings), non-classical congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (17-hydroxy-progesterone <3 ng/mL)], thyroid disorders\n(0.41<TSH<4.5 \u03bcIU/mL), and galactorrhea, breastfeeding, pregnancy,\ndecreased levels of glucose tolerance or having type 1/type 2 diabetes, familial\nhyperlipidemia, having a background of hypertension, suffering from liver/renal\ndisorders or congestive heart failure, having a history of coronary artery\ndisease, malignancy or acute infection (within 14 days), gestational diabetes\nmellitus, presence of any chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disorders,\nundergoing treatment of hormonal contraception and/or anti-androgen (within the\npreceding 6 months), and not using medications for dyslipidemia, hypertension,\nhyperglycemia, insulin resistance, or obesity were excluded from the study.    Anthropometric evaluation  The weight (kg) and height (cmr) of subjects were measured. BMI was calculated\nusing the following formula: BMI: weight (kg)/square meter of height\n(m 2 ). After a 15-min resting period, the blood pressure was\nmeasured while subjects were in a sitting position.    Biochemical evaluation  The venous blood samples of the subjects were obtained from the antecubital veins\nduring the early follicular phase of menstrual bleeding (days 3\u20135), either\nspontaneous or progesterone-induced menses, in the morning following a 10-h\nfasting period. The blood samples were placed in room temperature for at least\n30 min and allowed to clot. The clotted samples were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7g for\n15 min. For analysis of neudesin, the separated serum samples were kept in\naliquots at \u201380\u00b0C. Some dedicated kits (Abbott Diagnostics, Wiesbaden, Germany)\nfrom an auto-analyzer (Abbott Architect C 16000, IL, USA) were used to measure\nfasting plasma glucose (FPG), hs-CRP, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald equation  13  . Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) with its dedicated\nkits (Abbott Diagnostics, Wiesbaden, Germany) and auto-analyzer (Abbott\nArchitect I2000, IL, USA) were used to measure serum fasting plasma insulin\n(FPI) levels. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),\nestradiol (E 2 ), progesterone, DHEA-S, and total testosterone levels\nwere also measured via CMIA (UniCel DXI 800, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA,\nUSA). Additionally, the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) level was measured\nvia the chemiluminescence immunoassay technique (Immulite 2000 XPi, Simens\nHealthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany). The formula FAI: (total\ntestosterone/SHBG)\u00d7100 was used to calculate FAI. Insulin resistance was\nmeasured via homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)  14  and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)  15  .    Measurement of circulating dermcidin by ELISA  Human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Catalog number: 201-12-460,\nSunred Bioscience, Shanghai, China) were used to measure dermcidin levels (in\nduplicate), following the instructions of manufacturer. Intra-assay coefficient\nof variability (CV) was <6% and the inter-assay CV was <8%. The level of\ncirculation dermcidin range is between 1 and 300 ng/mL.    Statistical analysis  A power analysis using G Power 3.0.10 for Windows (Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t\nD\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) was considered to obtain the scale of\npopulation in the current study. The number of subjects involved in each group\nwas calculated using this program. Regarding the abovementioned program, a group\nof 70 subjects was selected for each group as \u03b1 and study power values were 0.05\nand 0.90, respectively.  A Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. The distribution of\nvariables was checked using Kolmogorov-Smirnov in each group. Normally\ndistributed data were displayed as mean with standard deviation (SD). Student\u2019s\nt-test was used for the comparison of variables. Pearson\u2019s correlation\ncoefficients were used to reveal the correlation of neudesin with metabolic and\nhormonal parameters. A multiple regression analysis was used to show an\nindependent link between neudesin and correlated parameters. The level of 95%\nfor the confidence interval was used. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.     RESULTS   Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the study population  The demographic and laboratory results are given in Table 1 . Circulating dermcidin levels were significantly\nincreased in PCOS subjects compared to controls (172.53\u00b142.41 vs. 108.44\u00b131.69\nng/mL, p<0.001). HOMA-IR, insulin, and hs-CRP levels were significantly\nhigher in women with PCOS, whereas QICKI levels were significantly lower in\nwomen with PCOS than controls. Blood pressures did not differ between groups.\nTriglycerides were notably elevated, whereas HDL-cholesterol levels were\nremarkably lower in PCOS subjects compared to control. Total cholesterol and\nLDL-cholesterol levels did not show significant differences.   Table 1.   Comparison of the demographic and laboratory characteristics of the\nsubjects.

Correlation and multivariate regression analysis  Dermcidin levels showed a positive correlation with BMI, hs-CRP, HOMA-IR, and\nBMI, whereas it displayed a negative correlation with QUICKI. Dermcidin levels\nexhibited a positive correlation with FBG, whereas dermcidin levels did not show\na correlation with insulin levels. Moreover, dermcidin did not display any\ncorrelation with FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone, and androgen as well as lipid\nprofiles ( Table 2 ). Dermcidin also showed\nan independent link with HOMA-IR and hs-CRP as well as an inversely independent\nlink with QUICKI. Additionally, a positive correlation between dermcidin and BMI\nvanished in regression analysis ( Table\n2 ).   Table 2.   Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis and multiple regression\nanalysis.

Comparing dermcidin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome subjects with and\nwithout insulin resistance using surrogate markers (quantitative insulin\nsensitivity check index and homeostasis model assessment of insulin\nresistance)  Polycystic ovary syndrome group was categorized into two different subdivisions\naccording to the comprising insulin resistance (HOMA-IR>2.71 and HOMA-IR\u22642.71\nand QUICKI\u22640.33 and QUICKI>0.33)  16 , 17  . Circulating dermcidin levels showed significant elevation in PCOS\nsubjects having insulin resistance compared to those PCOS subjects not having\ninsulin ( Figure 2 ).   Figure 2.   Comparing dermcidin levels in PCOS.     Since a statistically significant positive correlation was found between the\ndermcidin molecule and hs-CRP, mathematical modeling was performed to make an\nestimation according to the hs-CRP parameter by performing regression modeling,\nand the related equation is shown in Figure\n3 .   Figure 3.   Predicting dermcidin with regression modeling according to\nhs-CRP.        DISCUSSION  In the current study, we evaluated dermcidin levels in women with PCOS for the first\ntime. We found that circulating dermcidin levels were significantly increased in\nPCOS subjects compared to controls. PCOS subjects with insulin resistance had higher\nlevels of dermcidin than those PCOS subjects without insulin resistance. Dermcidin\nlevels showed an independent link to HOMA-IR and hs-CRP, whereas dermcidin levels\nexhibited an inversely independent link to QUICKI.  Insulin resistance plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PCOS albeit the\nunderlying cellular mechanisms are remaining unclear. In normal physiological\nconditions, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake mainly occurs through GLUT4 in muscle\nand fat tissues. It has been reported that GLUT4 protein expression is decreased in\nadipocytes of patients with PCOS  18  . Thus, the loss of GLUT4 in the adipocytes may be a significant contributor\nto the IR in patients with PCOS. Insulin receptor-mediated signal transduction is\ndefective in women with PCOS as well  19  . Pre-clinical data suggest that dermcidin induces insulin resistance via\ninhibiting GLUT4 gene expression and subsequently dermcidin impairs glucose uptake\nin cells  6  . In the current study, we found that dermcidin levels were notably elevated\nin PCOS subjects. Consistently, we found that insulin resistance marker-HOMA-IR\nlevels were increased, whereas insulin sensitivity marker-QUICKI levels were reduced\nin PCOS women. Moreover, we determined that dermcidin levels showed exhibited an\nindependent link with HOMA-IR, whereas dermcidin displayed an inversely independent\nlink with QUICKI. Additionally, PCOS subjects with insulin resistance had higher\nlevels of dermcidin than those PCOS subjects without insulin resistance. In light of\nthese data, dermcidin may play a role in the development of insulin resistance in\nPCOS subjects. Pre-clinical data suggest that dermcidin inhibits insulin secretion\nalbeit we could not find any relation between dermcidin and insulin levels.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation.\nIt has been reported that a variety of inflammatory markers in women with PCOS\nincluding CRP, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin 6 are increased  1 , 2 , 20  . The etiology of systemic inflammation in PCOS remains unclear. Dermcidin\nplays a crucial role in host immune defense. It has been reported that dermcidin\ninduced TNF-\u03b1 synthesis in liver cells  6  . In the current study, we found that circulating hs-CRP levels were higher in\nsubjects with PCOS compared to controls. Moreover, we determined an independent link\nbetween dermcidin and hs-CRP. These data suggest that increased dermcidin may play a\nrole in the development of inflammation in PCOS subjects.  Few clinical studies are currently involved in investigating the dermcidin levels;\nhowever, no data have yet been obtained regarding the relationship between dermcidin\nand metabolic parameters. A study showed that dermcidin plays a crucial role in the\npathogenesis of T1DM as well as in the severity of the disease  6  . It was reported that dermcidin induced insulin resistance via inhibiting\nglucose uptake in the liver by decreasing GLUT4 synthesis. In addition, dermcidin\ninduced inflammation  7 , 8  . In another study, circulating dermcidin levels in milk were notably elevated\nin subjects with gestational diabetes compared to controls  9  .  We had some limitations in our study. Insulin resistance was evaluated using\nformulations instead of the insulin clamp technique, a gold standard but invasive\nmethod. Although this cross-sectional designed study does not provide causality, it\nallows discovering the link between molecules and disorders.  In conclusion, increased dermcidin levels were independently related to the degree of\ninsulin resistance and inflammation in women with PCOS. Dermcidin may play a role in\ndeveloping insulin resistance and inflammation in PCOS, which needs further\nresearch.    COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL STANDARDS  The subjects gave their oral and written informed consent before their inclusion in\nthe study. The study adhered strictly to the principles of the Declaration of\nHelsinki as revised in 2008.",
