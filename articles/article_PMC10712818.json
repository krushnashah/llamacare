    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that may present with at\nleast two of the three findings of hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries and\noli-go/amenorrhea. The prevalence of PCOS varies between 5 and 13%, according to the\ndiagnostic criteria used ( Bozdag et\nal ., 2016 ). Its prevalence is higher in women with\nan-ovulatory infertility, obese women and women with first degree relatives with\nPCOS ( Kahsar-Miller et al .,\n2001 ; Alvarez-Blasco et\nal ., 2006 ; Azziz et\nal ., 2016 ). The serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH)\nlevels, Ferriman-Gallwey scores and ovarian volumes were found to be higher in\nadolescent girls born to women with PCOS than in adolescent girls born to women\nwithout PCOS ( Crisosto et al .,\n2019 ). In addition, serum luteinizing hormone and androgen levels were\nhigher in these girls ( Crisosto et\nal ., 2019 ).  Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, a member of the transforming growth factor \u03b2\nfamily, is significantly higher in women with PCOS than in the normal population and\nmay play role in the pathogenesis of PCOS by increasing LH secretion ( Pellatt et al ., 2007 ). In male\nfetuses, AMH is released from Sertoli cells, and it inhibits the development of\nM\u00fcllerian ducts ( Josso et\nal ., 2012 ). In female fetuses, the absence of AMH and\ntestosterone leads to the development of M\u00fcllerian ducts and regression of\nWolffian ducts ( Parker et al .,\n1999 ). Serum AMH levels are also higher in pregnant women with PCOS when\ncompared to non-PCOS controls. Recently, it has been hypothesized that serum AMH\nlevels may be high in female newborns from mothers with PCOS and elevated AMH in utero can lead to PCOS-like conditions ( Detti et al ., 2019 ; Tadaion Far et al ., 2019 ). A\nrecent meta-analysis suggested that female newborns of obese women as well as women\nwith PCOS have higher AMH levels ( Zhou et\nal ., 2022 ). On the other hand, male fetuses have already\nhigher levels of AMH than female fetuses ( Kollmann et al ., 2019 ). Higher AMH levels may indicate\nincreased ovarian reserve or hyperactivation of Sertoli cells ( Tadaion Far et al ., 2019 ). As expected, high\nlevels in male fetuses inhibit M\u00fcllerian duct development, and several\nM\u00fcllerian duct abnormalities may occur in the presence of AMH in female\nfetuses ( Detti et al ., 2017 ; 2019 ; Detti, 2014 ; Vanky & Carlsen,\n2012 ). High AMH levels exposed during intrauterine period may increase\nthe risk of abnormalities such as non-complex subseptate and bicornuate uterus by\ndelaying the fusion of the M\u00fcllerian ducts and preventing reabsorption of\nmidline structures ( Detti et al .,\n2017 ). If the AMH level is found to be high in the new-borns of mothers\nwith PCOS, new studies may reveal new findings related to the rate of\nM\u00fcllerian anomaly detection in these newborns at later ages.  A limited number of studies have investigated the AMH levels in newborns of mothers\nwith PCOS and contradictory results have been published ( Detti et al ., 2019 ). The small increments in\nmales who already have high AMH levels could be negligible. Also, this relatively\nsmall increment would not be expected to cause hypothetical congenital abnormality\nin males. The aim of the present study was to compare the cord-blood AMH levels\nbetween female new-borns of women with and without PCOS.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  The present prospective case-control study was conducted in Ankara University School\nof Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology between June 2020 to January\n2021. The study was approved by the Ankara University Ethical Committee for Human\nResearch (approval no.: I3-177-20; date: 26/03/2020). All of the participants were\nselected from the patients who were followed up in our gynecology and infertility\nout-patient clinic in the pre-conceptional period. During the study, 408 women gave\nbirth to a female newborn. PCOS history was present in 45 patients. Among those, two\npatients who had menstrual irregularities due to thyroid dysfunction and\nhyperprolactinemia were excluded. We excluded 16 patients whose preconceptional\nhistory could not be reached. Women who had a diagnosis of PCOS in pre-conceptional\nperiod and give live birth to a female newborn during the study period made up the\nPCOS group (n=27). Women who had regular cycles prior to pregnancy, not diagnosed\nwith PCOS, and give live birth to female newborn, made up the non-PCOS group (n=33).\nThe groups were divided into obese and non-obese subgroups. Obesity is defined as\nbody mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m 2 . The inclusion criteria were\nspontaneous and singleton pregnancy, age 18-40 years and presence of a female fetus.\nThe exclusion criteria were endocrinopathy that may cause menstrual irregularities\nsuch as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome and hyperprolactinemia,\nhistory of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and presence of a male fetus.  Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria ( Wang & Mol, 2017 ). The main outcome measure\nwas the cord-blood AMH levels. In addition, we compared the demographics of the PCOS\nand non-PCOS groups. We took a cord-blood sample during birth from all participants\nfor AMH measurement. The samples were taken from the umbilical artery, after\nclamping the cord, following delivery of the newborn. The samples were centrifuged\nand the serum stored at \u201380\u00b0C for up to 6 months before all measurements are\nperformed together. AMH was measured by an enzymatically amplified two-site\nimmunoassay (AMH ELISA; Beckman Coulter, Access immunanalyzer, USA). All the\nprocedure steps were taken according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The\nlowest detection limit of the assay was 0.02ng/mL. The mean interassay coefficient\nof variation (CV) was 3.1%, and the mean intraassay CV was 4.0%. A subgroup analysis\nwas also performed for obese patients (BMI \u226530kg/m 2 ).   Statistical Analysis  Data analyzes were performed by using the SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM Corporation,\nArmonk, NYC, USA). The samples were tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test to\ndetermine distribution normality. According to the results, non-parametric tests\nwere preferred. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U\ntest. The categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or the\nFisher\u2019s exact test, where appropriate. A p value of <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. The sample size calculation was based\non the previous study by Detti et\nal . (2019) , which reported median AMH levels of 0.342ng/\nml and 0.101ng/ml in the umbilical arteries of women with and without PCOS,\nrespectively. According to that, 23 patients were required in each group to have\na 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the\numbilical artery, AMH level from 0.101ng/ml in the non-PCOS group to 0.342ng/ml\nin the study group.     RESULTS  During the study period, 29 women with PCOS gave birth to a female newborn. Among\nthose, two patients who had menstrual irregularities due to thyroid dysfunction and\nhyperprolactinemia were excluded. As a result, 27 PCOS patients were included in the\nstudy group ( Figure 1 ). Thirty-three non-PCOS\npatients who gave birth to a female newborn were selected as the non-PCOS group. The\nnumber of obese patients in the PCOS and non-PCOS groups were 12 (44.4%) and 7\n(21.2%), respectively.   Figure 1 Flow-chart of the study population.    The demographic characteristics of the patients were mainly similar between the PCOS\nand non-PCOS groups ( Table 1 ). The maternal\nAMH level was significantly higher in the PCOS group (2.5ng/ml vs .\n1.7ng/ml, respectively; p <0.001). Pre-conceptional menstrual\nirregularities were also significantly higher in the PCOS group when compared to\nnon-PCOS controls (55.6% vs . 15.2%, respectively; p =0.002) ( Table 1 ).

The median cord-blood AMH levels of female newborns from PCOS patients were\nsignificantly higher than those in the non-PCOS group (0.33 ng/ml vs . 0.12 ng/ml, respectively; p <0.001)\n( Table 2 ). In addition, cord blood AMH\nlevels were significantly higher in both obese and non-obese PCOS patients when\ncompared to BMI-matched non-PCOS patients ( Table\n2 ). Figure 2 depicts the\ndistribution of PCOS and non-PCOS patients considering BMI and cord blood AMH\nlevels. However, the effect of PCOS was higher than BMI on cord blood AMH levels\n( Figure 3 ).

DISCUSSION  The present study was conducted to assess the cord-blood AMH levels of female fetuses\nborn to women with and without PCOS. According to the results obtained from this\nstudy the cord blood AMH levels of female fetuses born to women with PCOS were\nsignificantly higher than those from female fetuses born to women without PCOS. The\nsignificant differences also stand in obese and non-obese groups. However, the cord\nblood AMH levels were similar between obese and non-obese women with PCOS and\nbetween obese and non-obese women without PCOS.  Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels in pregnant women are lower than those in\nnon-pregnant controls, but AMH levels in pregnant women with PCOS were higher when\ncompared to non-PCOS women ( Tata et\nal ., 2018 ). In women with lean PCOS, a significant\nrelationship was demonstrated with hyperandrogenemia and high AMH levels during\npregnancy. However, in the same study, this relationship was not found in obese PCOS\npatients.  AMH can be detected in the cord blood around the 21 st gestational week,\nwhen the M\u00fcllerian ducts complete their development ( Vanky & Carlsen, 2012 ). Tadaion Far et al ., (2019) suggested that high AMH\nlevels in female newborns to women with PCOS might be due to increased ovarian\nreserve and granulosa cell proliferation. Some authors believe that the placental\ntransition may also play a role in the occurrence of these high levels. However,\nthere is no evidence to date to show placental transition of AMH hormone ( Detti et al ., 2019 ; Tata et al. , 2018 ). Whatever\nthe origin, high AMH levels during the intrauterine period may also increase the\nrisk of M\u00fcllerian duct abnormalities, such as non-complex subseptate and\nbicornuate uterus by delaying the fusion of the M\u00fcllerian ducts and\npreventing reabsorption of midline structures ( Detti et al ., 2017 ). Detti et al . (2017) reported that high AMH levels delay\nthe development of M\u00fcllerian duct and may cause mild M\u00fcllerian\nabnormalities.  In the present study, we found that the AMH levels in the cord blood of PCOS mothers\nwere significantly higher than in the cord-blood of non-PCOS controls. Detti et al . (2019) found that\nthe AMH levels of girls from PCOS mothers were significantly higher than the\ncontrols. However, in two recent studies Caanen et al . (2016) and Kollmann et al . (2019) both failed to show a\nsignificant difference in cord-blood AMH levels between female newborns born to PCOS\nand controls.  We also found that the cord blood AMH levels were significantly higher in both obese\nand non-obese PCOS patients when compared to BMI matched non-PCOS patients. A recent\nmeta-analysis by Zhou et al .\n(2022) , showed that AMH levels were also high in female newborns from\nobese women, in addition to women with PCOS. Similarly, Tadaion Far et al . (2019) divided patients\ninto obese and non-obese subgroups. When obese women were evaluated, they found\nhigher AMH levels in females born from mothers with PCOS than female newborns of\nmothers without PCOS. However, among non-obese patients, there was no difference in\nterms of cord blood AMH levels between female newborns of PCOS and non-PCOS women.\nWhen all patients were evaluated, AMH levels were found to be higher in newborns\nfrom mothers with PCOS ( Tadaion Far et\nal ., 2019 ). Our results were partially similar to those by Tadaion Far et al .\n(2019) and Zhou et al .\n(2022) , and we additionally found an increased cord blood AMH level in\nfemale newborns from non-obese PCOS patients. Our results indicate an increase in\ncord blood AMH level in PCOS irrespective of BMI.  One of the strengths of our study is the homogeneous patient population. The other\none is that there is no age difference between the study groups. Comparison of serum\nAMH levels in the same age groups provides a more accurate interpretation of the\nresults. The main limitation of our study is the low number of patients included in\nthe study. Another one may be the lack of measuring other hormones such as\nandrogens.  In conclusion, cord blood AMH levels were high among female newborns to women with\nPCOS when compared to women without PCOS. In addition, the significant difference\nexists both in obese and normal BMI subgroups. In addition, our results indicate\nthat BMI has no significant impact on cord blood AMH levels either in PCOS or\nnon-PCOS patients. Considering the possibility of M\u00fcllerian duct\nabnormalities due to high AMH levels in the intrauterine period, extensive research\nshould be performed urgently to uncover the exact relationship and possible\nmechanisms.",
