    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of\nreproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin\nresistance to type\u20092 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nInsulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and\nit is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising\nagents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic\naspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and\ncardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin\nmimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential\ntherapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices.\nIncretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that\ncould be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures\nhave become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal\nof metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment\ntargeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese\nwomen with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1\nagonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic\noptions for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological\nfeatures between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is\nthe potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in\nparallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line\nwith the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the\nassessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.",
    "body": "Introduction   Metabolic consequences of PCOS  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition affecting women\nin the reproductive age, with a prevalence of 15\u201320%. 1 PCOS is characterised by biochemical and clinical features of excess\nandrogen levels (hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities and polycystic\nmorphology of the ovaries. 2 Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance\nand insulin resistance, both drivers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 3 Nearly 50% of women with PCOS progress to frank metabolic syndrome (MS). 4 MS is defined as a group of conditions including dyslipidaemia, central\nadiposity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance, all predisposing to\ncoronary heart disease and diabetes. 5 The prevalence of MS in women with PCOS is significantly high, at around\n40\u201350% compared with the general population. 6 In addition, PCOS is associated with a spectrum of complications that\ninclude infertility, increased body weight, endometrial cancer and an increased\nrisk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 7 , 8 A therapeutic approach\ntargeting weight control is the cornerstone in the management of PCOS as\neffective weight loss is a positive predictor for long-term prevention of\ncardiometabolic disorders in PCOS. 9 However, weight loss in women with PCOS remains challenging to achieve.\nLifestyle modifications that include diet and physical activity are the\nfirst-line therapy. Still, it rarely reduces body weight by more than 10\u2009kg, 10 and the available evidence on lifestyle intervention is largely disappointing. 11 Pharmacotherapies to prevent and manage metabolic comorbidities in PCOS\nexist; however, they are underutilised as their effectiveness remains relatively\nunexplored, and they are used primarily to treat other conditions such as T2DM.\nThe surgical approach for weight loss has been an option for many decades, but\nit has not been used commonly as a therapeutic option in the management of PCOS.\nIn this review, we have aimed to provide an overview of the treatment options\nthat offer therapeutic and preventive advantages for the metabolic comorbidities\nin PCOS focussing on lifestyle modification, T2DM medications and bariatric\nsurgery. The review was conducted in accordance with the recommendations from\nthe international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of\npolycystic ovary syndrome. 12     Treatment options for managing metabolic comorbidities   Lifestyle modification intervention  Over 50% of the women with PCOS are overweight or obese, with a higher propensity\nof central adiposity, due primarily to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin\nsensitivity in this population. 13 Increased visceral fat deposition is associated with increased severity\nof PCOS and plays a pivotal role in high serum androgen production and reduced\nserum levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). 14 Obese women with PCOS are more prone to an increased risk of metabolic\nabnormalities and severe cardiovascular conditions compared with women without PCOS. 15 Even though the aetiology of PCOS not fully understood, PCOS has been\nassociated strongly with obesity and insulin resistance. 2 Given the links between obesity, insulin resistance and increased\ncardiometabolic risk factors, treating obesity is a priority, especially in\nobese women with PCOS.  In many cases, this can be achieved by modest weight loss and lifestyle\nmodification interventions, including dietary management and physical activity,\nare strongly recommended, particularly for those who are categorised as\nprediabetes as this may delay the onset of T2DM. 16 , 17 The recent international\nevidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS has\nemphasised the importance of physical activity and diet for managing\nPCOS-related symptoms and to prevent its metabolic complications. 18 Weight reduction can benefit obese women with PCOS through reduced\nadiposity, androgen levels, insulin levels, improved ovulatory function,\nincreased fertility and a reduction in the overall risk of CVD. 2 , 16 , 19 Given the\nstrong link between obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic problems, a low\nglycaemic index diet would seem to be an attractive option for weight reduction;\nhowever, no one single diet has proven to be better than another, although the\ntrials to date have been small, of limited duration and heterogeneous in their\ndesign. A small study of women with PCOS assigned for a ketogenic,\nlow-carbohydrate diet for 6\u2009months reported significant improvement in their\nweight, hormonal profiles and fertility. 20 Others have shown that a very modest reduction of carbohydrate intake\nfrom 55% to 41% of total energy reflected in favourable metabolic effects and a\npreferential decrease in fat mass among women with PCOS. 21 , 22 A\nsystematic review of relevant studies found that low carbohydrate diets improved\nthe hormonal profile, reduced insulin levels and helped resume ovulation in\nwomen with PCOS. 23 A survey of 14 women with PCOS administered a low ketogenic Mediterranean\ndiet for 12\u2009weeks, reported a significant reduction in serum insulin, blood\nglucose level and average weight loss of 9.4\u2009kg. 24 Previous studies showed that lifestyle modifications could be associated\nwith significant improvement in symptoms of PCOS. A study assessing the effect\nof isocaloric diets on insulin sensitivity and insulin levels has demonstrated\nthat moderate reduction in carbohydrate intake reduced fasting and challenged\ninsulin levels amongst women with PCOS. 25 A recent meta-analysis assessed the effect of different dietary\ncompositions on metabolic and reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS that\nshowed there was more significant weight loss with monounsaturated fat, improved\nmenstrual problems with a low glycaemic index diet and a more substantial\nreduction in insulin resistance. 26 Physical activity usually acts as an adjunct to dietary intervention for\nthe management of PCOS. A systematic review evaluating exercise intervention in\nPCOS reported that moderate-intensity regular aerobic exercise over a short\nperiod of time significantly improved menstrual regularity and ovulation and\ncontributed to reduced weight and insulin resistance in young and obese women\nwith PCOS. 27 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the effects of\nlifestyle interventions including exercise only or in combination with diet and\nbehavioural therapy in women with PCOS, showed significant effects of exercise\non the metabolic, anthropometric and cardiorespiratory outcomes. 28    Insulin sensitising agents  The pathophysiology of PCOS includes defective insulin secretion and function. 29 Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are known to contribute to the\nhigh level of androgens in PCOS. 30 Insulin helps to control ovarian function, and the ovaries are sensitive\nto high insulin levels. 2 Theca cells produce high androgen as a response to excess insulin, which\nin turn contributes to the arrest of follicular maturation that predisposes to\npolycystic ovarian morphology, an indicator of PCOS. 31 As well as its pivotal role in the pathology of PCOS, insulin resistance\nhas a detrimental effect by predisposing PCOS patients to long-term health\nproblems that including T2DM and CVD. Therefore, a therapeutic strategy to\naddress insulin resistance, including pharmacotherapy and lifestyle intervention\nis crucial in the management of PCOS.    Thiazolidinediones  Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that is peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist. Pioglitazone principally acts by increasing\nperipheral glucose uptake, regulating adipogenesis and insulin action. Its\neffect in improving insulin resistance, hyperandrogenaemia and ovulatory\ndysfunction has been seen in women with PCOS. 32 In a randomised control trial (RCT) investigating the effect of\npioglitazone versus placebo in PCOS, pioglitazone resulted in\nsignificant reductions in fasting serum insulin and the free androgen index,\nwhilst SHBG levels were increased. 33 A meta-analysis comparing the effect of metformin and pioglitazone in\ntreating PCOS reported a significant improvement in ovulation and menstrual\ncycle in the pioglitazone group. However, there was a marked increase in body\nmass index (BMI) score in the pioglitazone group compared with metformin. 34 A randomised open-label study assessing the effect of pioglitazone,\nmetformin and orlistat on mean insulin resistance (IR) and its biological\nvariability in women with PCOS, reported a significant overall reduction in IR\nand IR variability. 35 Despite the desirable effect of pioglitazone on the metabolic parameters\nin PCOS, there is considerable concern about the potential risk of myocardial\ndamage, congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema due to fluid retention. 36 However, whilst the absolute risk is low in young women with PCOS, weight\ngain is a concern with thiazolidinediones in women with PCOS who are obese, and\nits use is an unlicensed indication.    Metformin  Metformin is a member of the biguanide family with proven safety and efficacy.\nMetformin has long been used in the management of T2DM and it is one of the\ninsulin sensitising agents commonly used in the treatment of PCOS, 37 though it is still an unlicensed indication in PCOS. The mechanism of\naction of metformin is through inhibition of hepatic glucose production,\nincreased glucose uptake and increased insulin sensitivity in the peripheral\ntissues. The common side effects associated with metformin are nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhoea and abdominal bloating 38 ; however, the prevalence of these symptoms is variable, and the severity\nof the side effects can be reduced by titrating the dose guided by the severity\nof the symptoms, or by using modified-release preparations. Women with PCOS are\nat an increased risk of having prediabetes or T2DM. Despite this clear\nassociation, obesity sometimes confounds the link between PCOS and T2DM. Thus,\nprevention of T2DM in this cohort is crucial, and there is reliable evidence for\nthe use of metformin to reduce the risk of T2DM in high-risk women with PCOS. In\na study comparing metformin and lifestyle intervention in women with PCOS, a\nsignificant reduction in BMI was observed in both groups; however, reduction in\nandrogen levels was only seen in the metformin group. 39 In an RCT of obese and morbidly obese women with PCOS assessing the\neffect of metformin on body weight, a significant decrease in BMI independent of\nlifestyle modification was reported. 40 In a study of 3234 non-diabetic participants with elevated fasting plasma\nglucose randomised to either metformin or lifestyle intervention with a mean\nfollow up nearly 3\u2009years, lifestyle changes reduced the new incidence of T2DM by\nalmost 60%. In contrast, metformin reduced it by just over 30 % 41 ; however, this effect was lost entirely following the washout period.\nThis was further confirmed in a similar study where the impact of metformin no\nlonger existed after 12\u2009months of withdrawal. 42 Women with PCOS are also at an increased risk of CVD owing to the\nhyperinsulinemia, high androgen levels, obesity and dyslipidaemia. 43 There is evidence that obesity and PCOS independently affect vascular\nendothelial function 44 ; however, the association between high insulin levels and CVD is\nindependent of obesity. 45 , 46 Women with PCOS have worse lipid profiles compared with the\nhealthy population and they typically have low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\nand high triglyceride levels that are both strong predictors of CVD. 47 , 48 Thus, the\nmanagement of dyslipidaemia is crucial in PCOS. Metformin improves dyslipidaemia\nby either a direct effect on the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids or\nindirectly by reducing hyperinsulinemia. 49 Many studies have reported that metformin has a significant impact on\ndyslipidaemia; 50 , 51 however, there was no beneficial effect of metformin on\ntotal cholesterol levels. 52  In women with PCOS, metformin is usually prescribed at starting doses of\n500\u2013850\u2009mg daily and can be titrated up to 2000\u2009mg/day if tolerated. 53 Higher metformin doses have been beneficial in reducing weight and\nimproving lipid profiles, particularly in obese PCOS population. 40 There is also evidence of the development of vitamin B12 deficiency with\nlong-term metformin use. 54  \u2013 57 Therefore, due to\nmetformin intolerance and its associated adverse events, it is important to\nconsider other therapeutic options for the treatment of metformin intolerant\nwomen with PCOS.    Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogue  Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and\nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are recognised stimulators\nfor glucose-dependent insulin release, particularly following meal ingestion,\nknown as the incretin effect. 58 The impaired incretin effect is common in conditions of insulin\nresistance, particularly T2DM. A recent study has reported lower incretin\nhormone levels in patients with PCOS. 59 Therefore, targeting this system has become a practical therapeutic\napproach in the treatment of T2DM, 60 with both a glycaemic improvement and a reduction in weight in patients\nwith T2DM.  Given that insulin resistance is the main driver for metabolic and endocrine\ndysfunction in PCOS, the therapeutic advantages of GLP-1 agonist therapy in this\npopulation is logical. 61 Even though the primordial effect of GLP-1 is not to stimulate insulin\nsecretion, they might indirectly improve the insulin sensitivity by their weight\nreduction effect. A recent study by Yaribeygi et al. suggested\nthat these agents also enhance insulin sensitivity by acting on eight different\nmolecular pathways including inflammatory, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism,\nGLUT-4 expression/translation, \u03b2-cells function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and\ninsulin signalling pathways. 62 Commercially available GLP-1 agonists include liraglutide, semaglutide,\ndulaglutide and exenatide. A once-daily injection of liraglutide (1.2\u2009mg or\n1.8\u2009mg) has shown to improve levels of glycaemic control in patients with T2DM\n(HbA1c reduced by 1.5%) with concomitant weight loss. 63 Similar results were illustrated with semaglutide treatment (HbA1c\nreduced by 1.4%), with significant weight reduction. 64 Liraglutide showed a significant cardiovascular risk reduction in the\nLEADER study. 65 A study that explored the effects of exenatide on cardiovascular risk\nmarkers in women with PCOS demonstrated substantial weight reduction and\nimprovement in the endothelial markers. 66 Of the several agents, the only one that has been used extensively in\nPCOS is liraglutide. A single observational study has explored the effect of\nliraglutide on weight loss in obese and overweight patients with PCOS, with\npromising results. In this trial (mean duration of treatment 27.8\u2009weeks), 84\nobese women with PCOS were treated with subcutaneous liraglutide daily injection\n(starting dose of 0.6\u2009mg with daily increment to 1.2\u2009mg and then 1.8\u2009mg if\ntolerated) for 4\u2009weeks and followed for over 27\u2009weeks and showed a significant\nreduction in weight and BMI. 67 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis that compared the efficacy\nof GLP-1 agonists and metformin in women with PCOS have shown a significant\nimprovement in insulin sensitivity, reduced BMI and abdominal girth compared\nwith metformin. 68 However, similar studies reported positive results on weight reduction\nand a decrease in testosterone levels, but no significant effects on insulin\nlevels and insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS treated with GLP-1 receptor\nanalogues (RAs). 69 , 70 In a trial that assessed the effects of treatment with\nliraglutide (1.8\u2009mg od) on atherothrombotic risk in obese women with PCOS\ncompared with control, reported a significant reduction in both weight and for\natherothrombotic markers including endothelial function and clotting. 71 Another trial that examined the effect of liraglutide (1.8\u2009mg) on quality\nof life (QOL) and depression in obese PCOS patients showed a dramatic weight\nreduction which significantly improved QOL. 72    Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors also known as gliptins (e.g.\nsitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin) are oral\nanti-hyperglycaemic agents for the treatment of T2DM; they are usually used as a\nsecond or third-line treatment after metformin. 73 They work by inhibiting DPP-4 \u2013 a ubiquitous enzyme that is responsible\nfor the degradation of internally produced GLP-1. 74 Sitagliptin is the most studied class of this drug so far. A double-blind\ncrossover study tested the effect of sitagliptin on blood glucose levels and\nvisceral fat (VAT) in women with PCOS, and demonstrated a reduction in the\nmaximal glucose response to the oral glucose tolerance and VAT. 75 In a pilot randomised study that examined sitagliptin as a potential\ntreatment option in metformin intolerant PCOS patients, sitagliptin improved\n\u03b2-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity. 76 In an animal study, sitagliptin reduced fasting blood glucose, lowered\nandrogen levels and improved ovarian fibrosis in rats with PCOS. 77 The most reported adverse reactions to gliptin therapy are headache,\nbreathing problems and pharyngitis. 78 Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction\nand dermatological reaction, have been reported with saxagliptin therapy though\nthey are rare. 79    Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors  Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) (e.g. empagliflozin and\ndapagliflozin) are a class of oral medications used in the management of T2DM.\nTheir mode of action is by inhibiting SGLT-2 in the proximal convoluted tubule\n(PCT) of the kidney that reduces glucose reabsorption and increases urinary\nglucose excretion. 80 As glucose is eliminated, its plasma levels drop, leading to a\nsignificant improvement in glycaemic parameters. 81 This mechanism of action is solely glucose-dependent, and unlike other\nagents, it is insulin-independent; therefore, the risk of hypoglycaemia is minimal. 81 There is an emerging role of SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of\nobesity; their body weight effect is promising in addition to their protective\nadvantages for cardiovascular and renal events. 82 In addition to their glucose-lowering effect, they can also improve\ninsulin sensitivity via several molecular pathways including\nreduction of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, enhance \u03b2-cells function, reduce\nthe oxidative damage and inflammatory processes, improve caloric deposition and\nweight loss. 83  Empagliflozin has demonstrated improvement in glycaemic control as monotherapy or\nin combination with other glucose-lowering agents. In a 24-week\nplacebo-controlled study (EMPA-REG-MONO), empagliflozin at both doses of 10\u2009mg\nand 25\u2009mg showed significant reduction of HbA1c % (\u20131.43%, \u20131.44%, respectively)\ncompared with placebo in T2DM patients. 84 Empagliflozin, as an add-on to pioglitazone and compared with placebo in\na 24-week study in patients with T2DM (EMPA-REG-PIO), demonstrated a significant\nreduction in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c compared with placebo. 85 Treatment with SGLT2-inhibitors was also associated with significant\nweight reduction, with an average of 2\u20134\u2009kg. 86 Data from studies in patients with T2DM showed that 60\u201370% of the total\nweight reduction observed with dapagliflozin was attributed to the reduction in\nfat mass including both visceral, subcutaneous adipose tissues and body\nwater. 87 , 88 The EMPA-REG-OUTCOME trial was conducted in 7020 patients\nwith T2DM with established CVDs and showed that the primary composite outcome\n(MACE) of cardiovascular death, myocardial infraction and stroke was\nsignificantly reduced in empagliflozin-treated patients. 89 Similar results were seen in the CANVAS (for canagliflozin) trial, which\nenrolled 10,142 T2DM patients at high risk of CVD; the primary outcome (MACE)\nwas reduced by 14%. 90 However, even though data from DECLARE-TIMI trials (for dapagliflozin)\ndid not show a significant effect on MACE outcome, it did demonstrate a lower\nrate of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalisation for heart failure. 91 Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has also shown a reno-protective effect\nin high risk patients with T2DM. In the CANVAS trial, canagliflozin showed a 40%\nreduction in eGFR, reduced the need for dialysis and decreased deaths from renal\ncauses, and the progression to albuminuria was reduced by 27%. 90 Data from the canagliflozin trial in patients with impaired renal\nfunctions (CREDENCE) showed a significant reduction in renal composite outcomes\nby 34 %, including end-stage renal failure, doubling serum creatinine and deaths\nfrom renal causes. 92  Recently, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors have shown promising results in trials\ninvolving patients with PCOS. In a 12-week randomised open-label study of\nempagliflozin versus metformin in obese women with PCOS, treatment with\nempagliflozin demonstrated significant improvement of anthropometric parameters\nand body composition but no changes were observed in the metabolic parameters. 93 This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors could potentially be useful in the\nmanagement of PCOS. Common adverse events reported for the SGLT2 inhibitors\ninclude genital infections, genitourinary tract infection, vulvovaginal\ncandidiasis and vulvovaginitis. 89    Myo-inositol  Inositol is a carbocyclic sugar that is present in abundance in the human and\nplant cells. 94 In humans, it is synthesised principally in the liver and the kidney, and\nis naturally present in legumes, cereal, corn and meat. 95 It can be found in nine different isomeric forms, with myo-inositol (MYO)\nand d -chiro-inositol being the most represented. MYO plays an essential\nrole as the structural foundation for several second messengers in various\nintracellular signal transduction pathways, including insulin signal\ntransduction. MYO-based second messenger activation increases the activity of\nglucose transport proteins and regulates glucose intake, while d -chiro-inositol-based second messenger activation stimulates glycogen\nsynthesis. Abnormal inositol synthesis and metabolism has been reported in both\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes. 96 Inositol has been used as a dietary supplement with increasing popularity\nin the treatment of various conditions, including T2DM, gestational diabetes\n(GD) and PCOS. 97 A retrospective study reported a significantly low risk of GD in PCOS\nwomen treated with MYO compared with controls. 98  MYO intake has shown beneficial effects in ovulation and the response to assisted\nfertilisation in otherwise infertile women with PCOS. 99 A recent systematic review that assessed the impact of MYO in women with\nPCOS concluded that MYO supplements improved hormonal and reproductive problems\nof PCOS. In addition, it enhanced follicular development and oocyte maturation. 100 Generally, MYO supplements are well tolerated at the currently\nrecommended doses of 2\u20134\u2009g/day with minimal safety issues; therefore, its\nclinical application in the management of PCOS is worth considering.    Statins  Dyslipidaemia, as reflected in elevated LDL-C, triglycerides and reduced HDL-C,\nis prevalent in women with PCOS and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk. 101 Therefore, effective treatment of PCOS would encompass improvement in the\nlipid profile and subsequently reduced cardiovascular morbidity.  There is growing evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of PCOS. 102 Statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and\nsimvastatin) are an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)\nreductase \u2013 a rate-controlling enzyme essential in the cholesterol biosynthesis\npathway. Blocking this enzyme will stop the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate\nand subsequently block cholesterol synthesis. 103 In a randomised placebo-controlled study, atorvastatin significantly\nreduced insulin resistance, inflammatory markers and hyperandrogenaemia in women\nwith PCOS compared with placebo. 104 When both the atorvastatin and placebo group were followed up with\nmetformin for another 12\u2009weeks, atorvastatin pre-treatment to metformin in women\nwith PCOS demonstrated significant improvements in HOMA-IR (homeostasis model\nassessment insulin resistance), free androgen index (FAI), total testosterone\nand sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in atorvastatin pre-treated group\ncompared with placebo pre-treated group, suggesting that atorvastatin augments\nthe effect of metformin in PCOS patients. 105 In this study, when the effect of atorvastatin on the markers of\ninflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction were examined, 12\u2009weeks of treatment\nwith atorvastatin significantly reduced acylation stimulating protein (ASP),\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).\nSubsequently, there was a substantial improvement in HOMA-IR and testosterone levels. 106  In the same study, the effect of atorvastatin on pancreatic \u03b2-cell function\n(HOMA-\u03b2) was examined, which showed a significant reduction on HOMA-\u03b2. However,\nthis result was maintained by metformin treatment for another 12\u2009weeks, which\nindicated a potential improvement of insulin resistance and therefore, a\nreduction in \u03b2-cell requirement rather than an actual fall in \u03b2-cell function. 107 Treatment with atorvastatin also significantly reduced serum\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) \u2013 a marker of oxidative stress among obese women with PCOS. 108 Furthermore, atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of\nandrostenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) in this cohort of\nwomen with PCOS. 109 A 12-week course of atorvastatin also significantly raised the\nconcentration of serum vitamin D (25OHD) level among women with PCOS compared\nwith placebo. 105 However, until further robust data are available to clarify its efficacy,\ndue to its potential teratogenicity it should not be used in young women of\nreproductive age.     Weight loss medications   Orlistat  Orlistat is both a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces the\nabsorption of prandial dietary fat by minimising the hydrolysis of triglyceride. 110 Orlistat is recognised in obesity treatment with proven, though low,\nefficacy. A study evaluated and compared the effect of treatment with orlistat versus metformin on the biochemical and hormonal factors in\nwomen with PCOS, treatment with orlistat showed a significant reduction in\nweight and androgen level compared with metformin. 111 A randomised open labelled parallel study compared the change in insulin\nresistance (IR) and its biological variability after treatment with orlistat,\nmetformin and pioglitazone in obese patients with PCOS, orlistat significantly\nreduced both IR and its biological variability compared with metformin and pioglitazone. 35 In a study, women with PCOS treated with orlistat were compared with\nmetformin and lifestyle intervention, and there was an improvement in lipid\nprofiles, weight, BMI and waist circumference. 112 Also, orlistat reduced androgen levels, parameters of IR and total\ncholesterol. 113 , 114 Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure and\nplays a role in the prevention of T2DM in this high-risk population, possibly by\nits effect on weight reduction. 115 However, orlistat at the recommended dose of 120\u2009mg up to 3 times a day\ntaken with food has significant side effects, including fatty stool, diarrhoea,\nabdominal pain and flatulence. 116 It may also cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. 117 While orlistat might have desirable effects in the management of obesity,\nits relevance in the control of the metabolic aspect of PCOS remains\ncontroversial.     Historical weight loss agents   Sibutramine  Sibutramine is an appetite suppressant used as an adjunct to lifestyle\nintervention in the treatment of obesity. It is a monoamine reuptake inhibitor\nthat reduces the uptake of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, noradrenaline\nand dopamine. 118 Therefore, it increases their availability in the synaptic clefts, which\nhelp reducing appetite, enhancing satiety and resulting in reduced food intake. 119 An RCT reported significant weight reduction after 6\u2009months of treatment\nwith sibutramine at daily dose of 15\u2009mg (7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u2009kg) compared with placebo\n(2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2\u2009kg) in women with PCOS. 120 In addition, another RCT reported even greater weight reduction\n(\u221215.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 versus \u201311.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9) with a lower daily dose of 10\u2009mg. 121 However, sibutramine has a significant cardiovascular risk through\nincreased cardiovascular mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction. 122 Therefore, the use of sibutramine for weight loss in women with PCOS with\nhigh cardiometabolic risk is questionable.    Rimonabant  Rimonabant is an anorectic, selective cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) blocker used\nfor obesity treatment. A study assessed the impact of rimonabant on the markers\nof hepatic injury in obese women with PCOS without non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD), rimonabant significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nand weight. 123 A trial comparing the effect of treatment with rimonabant and metformin\non incretin hormones in obese women with PCOS showed a significant increase in\nGIP after 3\u2009months of rimonabant treatment, no change was reported with metformin. 124 Moreover, treatment with rimonabant augmented the weight loss effect and\nenhanced the metabolic benefit of metformin treatment in obese women with PCOS. 125 However, rimonabant demonstrated superior impact in weight reduction,\nimproved insulin resistance and a reduction in androgen levels compared with\nmetformin in women with PCOS. 126 Nevertheless, data from clinical trials showed that rimonabant caused\nsevere psychiatric problems, including a depressive disorder, mood changes and\nsuicidal ideation. 127 Both sibutramine and rimonabant have been withdrawn from the market in\nview of their side effect profile.    Naltrexone/bupropion  Naltrexone is an opioid receptors antagonist with great affinity to the \u00b5 opiate\nreceptor, which is implicated in eating behaviours. In experimental studies,\nnaltrexone has shown an ability to block dopamine release and subsequently\nreduce food intake, food eating and binge eating behaviour. However, in clinical\nhuman studies, naltrexone as monotherapy has not produced consistent results. It\nhas recently been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) for the management of alcohol and drug addiction. 128 Bupropion is an anti-depressant that is approved for the management of\ndepression, seasonal affective disorder and to help with smoking cessation that\nacts by blocking dopamine reuptake. In clinical studies its main side effect was\nweight loss. 129 Although these agents were not principally approved for management of\nobesity, clinical trials suggest that the combination of these agents induces\nsignificant weight loss. Therefore, the combination of naltrexone/bupropion\n(N/B), which is marketed as CONTRAVE pills, or COR for short, has recently been\napproved for obesity treatment both in the US and Europe.  In two double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials CONTRAVE Obesity Research\n(COR-I and COR-II) in overweight and obese patients, combination of N/B\ndemonstrated significant weight loss (\u20138.1% and \u20138.2%, respectively) and showed\nan improvement in cardiometabolic parameters (\u20131.8% and \u20131.4%) compared with\nplacebo. 130 , 131 Furthermore, in the COR-BMOD (COR-Behavioural\nModification) trial, patients treated with the combination of N/B in addition to\nan intensive behavioural modification programme or placebo showed significant\nweight loss with N/B+BMOD compared with placebo\u2004+\u2004BMOD (\u201311.5% versus \u20137.3%; p <\u20090.01, respectively). 132 Furthermore, in the COR-diabetes study, where overweight and obese\npatients with T2DM were randomised to N/B or placebo, treatment with the N/B\ncombination showed a significant weight loss effect regardless of concomitant\ndiabetes medications (\u20135.9% versus \u20132.2%; p <\u20090.01 respectively) compared with placebo. 133  The combination of N/B has not been used for PCOS treatment; therefore, there is\nno evidence of its efficacy in this cohort. However, a few studies have\ndemonstrated positive effects of naltrexone monotherapy in the treatment of\nPCOS. In a RCT, 30 clomiphene-resistant obese women with PCOS treated with\nnaltrexone(50\u2009mg/day) for a duration of 6\u2009months showed significant reductions\nin BMI, fasting serum insulin and luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating\nhormone (LH/FSH) ratio. 134 It also showed significant effect in combination with pulsatile\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by improving ovarian responsiveness to\novulation induction in obese women with PCOS compared with pulsatile GnRH alone. 135 Thus, the combination of naltrexone and bupropion may have a significant\nclinical effect on weight management for the metabolic aspect of PCOS.    Bariatric surgery  Bariatric surgery has been around for decades; it ameliorates metabolic\nabnormalities, including insulin resistance and excess body weight. Although\nbariatric surgery may be undertaken using various procedures, the most commonly\nused is sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and adjustable\ngastric banding. 136 However, evidence has shown that RYGB is superior to sleeve gastrectomy\nin both obesity treatment and remission of T2DM. 137 , 138 The current guidelines\nrecommend bariatric surgery as a treatment option for obese patients with BMI of\n40\u2009kg/m 2 or more, or BMI between 35\u2009kg/m 2 and\n40\u2009kg/m 2 and other comorbidities such as T2DM or high blood pressure. 139 Although PCOS is more prevalent in morbidly obese women at reproductive\nage, only a few studies have addressed the effect of bariatric surgery in this\ncohort. A prospective study followed 17 PCOS women with an average age of\n30\u2009years prospectively for 26\u2009months after biliopancreatic bypass or a\nlaparoscopic RYGB. Menstruation was normalised for most patients, and an average\nweight loss of 41\u2009kg was reported. Moreover, there was a significant improvement\nin the parameters of insulin resistance (50% reduction of HOMA-IR), hirsutism\nand androgen profile. 140 In addition, a retrospective study of 24 morbidly obese women with PCOS\n(average BMI 50\u2009kg/m\u00b2, mean age 34\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009years and mean body weight of 306\u2009\u00b1\u200944\nIb) who had RYGB and followed for over two consecutive years was reported. All\nwomen resumed their menstrual cycle within 3.5\u2009months, there was a weight loss\nof approximately 56.7% at 12\u2009months and HbA1c reduced from 8.1% to 5.1% in 3\u2009months. 141 PCOS presents a great risk for MS since many women with PCOS are obese\nand bariatric surgery in selected women may provide a longer-term therapeutic\noption in selected subjects. 142     Future treatment options   Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist (Twincretins)  Twincretins is a GLP-1 and GIP RA named LY3298176 (a fatty acid-modified\npeptide). It is currently in phase\u2009II studies and has shown a promising effect\nin reducing A1c and weight in T2DM patients. In a randomised,\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigating the efficacy and\ntolerability of LY3298176 compared with a selective GLP-1 agonist (dulaglutide)\nin T2DM patients, LY3298176 reduced fasting blood glucose and had a greater\nsignificant weight reduction than dulaglutide, with tolerability that was\ncomparable with the GLP-1 agonist. 143 A recent randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind phase\u2009IIa trial\ncompared the efficacy and the safety profile of a novel dual-action product\n(NNC0090-2746) in inadequately controlled patients with T2DM. Patients were\nrandomised to 1.8\u2009mg of NNC0090-2746 by subcutaneous injection daily or placebo\nas one arm. Liraglutide 1.8\u2009mg subcutaneous daily injection with 2\u2009weeks\ntitration was given as an open-label arm. The results showed that NNC0090-2746\nsignificantly improved glycaemic control (HbA1c) and reduced body weight\ncompared with placebo. 144 From the current data, it would seem that twincretins are promising new\ntherapies to enhance the management of T2DM and weight control with potential\nutility for PCOS treatment.    Dual GLP-1/glucagon agonist  GLP-1/glucagon co-agonists with enhanced metabolic efficacy have been developed\nrecently as therapeutic options for diabetes and obesity treatment. In animal\nmodels and non-human primates, GLP-1/glucagon agonists have shown potency to\ninduce glycaemic control, weight loss and reduce hepatic fat content. 145 A novel GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist used in diet-induced obese mice\nnormalised glucose tolerance, improved adiposity and metabolic parameters, 146 suggesting that this combination could be potentially beneficial in\npatients with diabetes and possibly women with PCOS.    Triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon agonist  The potential success of dual GLP-1/GIP and GLP-1/glucagon agonists has inspired\nthe invention of a single combination of an agonist of all three target\nreceptors. In an animal model, the tri-agonist had a significant weight lowering\neffect that was higher than that of liraglutide. 147 Moreover, it reduced plasma glucose and cholesterol levels. 148 HM15211 is a glucagon agonist with the ability to target all three\nreceptors that showed significantly higher weight loss effect compared with\nliraglutide, reducing hepatic fat mass and improving lipid profiles. 149 Therefore, this could potentially be a therapeutic option in women with\nPCOS to improve metabolic risk if proven beneficial in clinical studies.    Glucagon receptor antagonist  Glucagon is a hormone produced by \u03b1-cells of the pancreas that potently regulates\nglucose homeostasis during fasting states by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis\nand glycogenolysis. 150 High glucagon levels and increased glucagon to insulin ratio have been\nreported in patients with diabetes. 151 Therefore, blocking glucagon receptors would be predicted to reduce\nhepatic glucose production and consequently improve glycaemic control. Glucagon\nhas an opposing action to insulin; therefore, drugs targeting the inhibition of\nglucagon action are in development as potential therapies for T2DM, though what\ntheir utility may be in PCOS is unclear.    Imeglemin  Imeglemin is a novel class of glucose-lowering agents developed to treat T2DM,\nthough its mechanism of action remains elusive. However, experimental studies\nsuggest that it acts by blocking the oxidative phosphorylation that is a crucial\nstep in hepatic gluconeogenesis. 152 In addition, it increases insulin secretion and improves muscle glucose uptake. 153 A recent study reported that imeglemin can improve insulin sensitivity\nthrough several molecular pathways including insulin signalling transduction via activating Akt phosphorylation. 154  Imeglemin may also improve glucose homeostasis by improving \u03b2-cell function,\nsuppressing gluconeogenesis, lowering insulin resistance, improving\nmitochondrial function and attenuating oxidative stress. 155 This novel mechanism of action for imeglemin provides an additional\nbenefit to patients with T2DM and potentially complementing other oral\nantidiabetes therapies. However, clinical trials are needed to examine its\nefficacy and tolerability in women with PCOS.    microRNA therapy  Evidence is emerging about the potential therapeutic effect of microRNAs (miRNAs)\nin the treatment of many diseases, including obesity-related disorders. MiRNAs\nare non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that\npost-transcriptionally regulate gene expression; miRNAs are differentially found\nin PCOS compared with normal controls. 156 , 157 Their binding to target\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) causes mRNA cleavage, translational repression and mRNA\ndecay. 158  \u2013 161 miRNAs are released by\nmany tissues, including adipose tissues, and act as both endocrine and paracrine\nmessenger between various target organs. Furthermore, miRNAs are linked to\nadipocytes differentiation and, thus, might be potential biomarkers for obesity\nand its related diseases. Currently, there are a number of ongoing clinical\ntrials assessing the potential therapeutic effects of targeting miRNAs in\nobesity and its associated metabolic disorders (e.g. T2DM, non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), 162 which could also potentially benefit women with PCOS.  It should be emphasised that all these agents are contradicted during pregnancy\nand lactation due to their teratogenic effects. There is evidence that metformin\nis safe and does not increase congenital abnormalities as well as it being\ngenerally tolerable during pregnancy. Women with PCOS are relatively young and\nusually of reproductive age; therefore, it is imperative to mention that, apart\nfrom metformin, the use of all other pharmacological agents should be restricted\nto women with no desire for pregnancy and those using reliable methods of\ncontraception. It should also be noted that these agents are not licensed for\nuse in adolescents with PCOS. At present, the first-line therapy in women with\nPCOS should focus on lifestyle intervention including dietary modifications and\nphysical activity with additional pharmacological agents as indicated.     Conclusion  There is a wide range of therapeutic options with potential advantages available for\nthe management of the metabolic comorbidities in PCOS ( Figures 1 and 2 , Table\u20091 ). It is crucial to appreciate the\nefficacy and safety of metformin in providing metabolic benefits in PCOS, although\nit is still unlicensed for this indication. However, it is also imperative to\nacknowledge that no single agent can cover the entire spectrum of metabolic\ndisorders in women diagnosed with PCOS. Metabolic benefits and improvement of\nparameters of metabolic comorbidities are superior with a combination of lifestyle\nintervention, metformin, GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2 inhibitors and bariatric surgery than\nmonotherapy. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA are promising therapeutic agents with\nsignificant potential advantages in improving metabolic abnormalities in women with\nPCOS and need further studies. Bariatric surgery appears to be a highly effective\ntherapy that may have benefit in selected women with PCOS for the reversal of the\nmetabolic abnormalities and the prevention of T2DM. There are several emerging\ntherapies for the treatment of T2DM that may have direct utility in the management\nof the metabolic aspects of PCOS; however, clinical studies are needed to evaluate\ntheir clinical efficacy and safety in women with PCOS.
