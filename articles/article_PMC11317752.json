    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, characterized by such clinical manifestations as menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (Hajam et\u00a0al., 2024 ). There is no globally accepted treatment for PCOS. It is essential that treatment be addressed at an individual level, depending on women's symptoms, and shaped within the framework of their needs (Escobar\u2010Morreale, 2018 ). Because PCOS affects women for life, when managed well, there is only remission rather than full recovery. In PCOS, although different treatment priorities and targets are determined according to the course of the disease, lifestyle interventions take priority. Related to this, it is a priority for PCOS to be careful with their nutrition in treatment (Che et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  Along with the existence of high inflammatory cytokines, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels, and increased leukocyte count, PCOS is associated with low\u2010grade chronic inflammation (Diamanti\u2010Kandarakis et\u00a0al., 2006 ). In addition to inflammation, oxidative stress also appears to be increased in PCOS (Gao et\u00a0al., 2023 ), with lower serum levels of Total Antioxidant Status (TAS), antioxidants like vitamin E and vitamin C, and higher levels of oxidative stress markers like malondialdehyde (MDA), paraoxonase\u20101 (PON1), xanthine oxidase, uric acid, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (Azim et\u00a0al., 2024 ; Bahreiny et\u00a0al., 2024 ; Fenkci et\u00a0al., 2003 ; Mohammadi, 2019 ). Increased homocysteine levels in PCOS (Sharma et\u00a0al., 2024 ) also contribute to oxidative stress (Faverzani et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity (Fenkci et\u00a0al., 2003 ) contribute to the increased risk of many reproductive and metabolic health problems in PCOS. These include dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and infertility (Di Lorenzo et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Fenkci et\u00a0al., 2003 ; Thackray, 2019 ). Related to all these, there are alterations in the intestinal microbiota in PCOS, and it is stated that the diversity of the intestinal microbiota changes (Sun et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  Hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, and inflammation are the main factors affecting the microbiota in PCOS (He & Li, 2020 ; Singh et\u00a0al., 2023 ). It is known that there are differences in the microbiota composition of PCOS compared to healthy controls, a decrease in biodiversity, and changes in specific bacterial taxa in the intestinal microbiome of PCOS (Guo et\u00a0al., 2022 ). It has been shown in multiple studies to date that alpha diversity decreases in PCOS (Insenser et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Jobira et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Liu et\u00a0al., 2017 ). It is possible to see different results in studies on the microbiota composition of women with PCOS. For example, regarding the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, a decreased or lower Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio (Zhou, Ni, Yu, et\u00a0al., 2020 ) or the lower phylum Bacteroidetes and the similar phylum Firmicutes have also been reported (Jobira et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Although dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota has been shown to be important in PCOS (Insenser et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Jobira et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Liu et\u00a0al., 2017 ), it is stated that further studies are needed due to inconsistent results in some studies showing that the abundance of some bacteria increased, and in others, these bacteria decreased (Yurtda\u015f & Akdevelio\u011flu, 2020 ).  Kefir, on the other hand, is a fermented dairy product that has shown similar effects in various disease groups to date and can regulate the homeostasis of the organism by directly affecting the gut\u2010brain axis (Peluzio et\u00a0al., 2021 ). The positive effect of kefir is related to the various bioactive compounds produced during fermentation, including bioactive peptides, exopolysaccharides, organic acids, and bacteriocins, and the diverse microbiota it contains (Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Orozco et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Kefir can be produced industrially or traditionally. Traditional kefir is produced using grain, and kefir grains are a complex consortium of yeast and bacteria with a symbiotic relationship. Traditional kefir has higher antioxidant content (McGovern et\u00a0al., 2024 ) and higher microbial diversity (Bi\u00e7er et\u00a0al., 2021 ). An in\u00a0vivo study has shown that the microbiota of kefir produced by natural kefir grain causes boosted immunomodulator properties as compared to kefir produced using starter culture, as is typical in commercial kefir (Davras et\u00a0al., 2018 ). On the other hand, it is stated that by\u2010products from dairy processing are a source of waste, and this negatively affects the environment. Therefore, finding applications for by\u2010products is significant for reducing waste and contributing to sustainability (McGovern et\u00a0al., 2024 ). Encapsulation technology from probiotics in sustainable food production is important (Agriopoulou et\u00a0al., 2023 ). Encapsulated probiotics may also show better viability and stability in kefir during storage (Afzaal et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Agriopoulou et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  Based on all this, although the positive effects of kefir on health in different diseases have been shown so far, there is no study examining the effects of kefir consumption on PCOS. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of kefir consumption on intestinal microbiota modulation, and some health outcomes such as quality of life, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarkers.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Subjects  This was an intervention study that was executed from October 2022 to March 2023 among the 17 women with PCOS (according to Rotterdam criteria, which includes suffering from at least two of the following symptoms: oligo\u2010 or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and exclusion of other etiologies) in Gazi University Hospital, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Women diagnosed with PCOS aged between 18 and 40\u2009years and whose Body Mass Index (BMI) values were between 18.5 and 29.99\u2009kg/m 2 were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy or breastfeeding, smoking, alcohol consumption, having endocrine diseases, taking lipid\u2010lowering drugs or blood pressure regulating medication, taking antibiotics or medications related to PCOS treatment or vitamin\u2013mineral or probiotics within 1\u2009month prior to study inclusion.    2.2  Study protocol  In this study, individuals were followed for 8\u2009weeks, and during this period, they were asked to consume 250\u2009mL/day of kefir and maintain their routine nutrition and physical activity habits. The kefir consumed in the course of the study was delivered to the participants by the researcher in seven bottles every week, thus keeping in touch with the participants every week and at the same time aiming to preserve the microbial composition of the kefir as much as possible. Before giving kefir to the participants, it was kept in the refrigerator after receiving it from the company, and care was taken not to disrupt the cold chain.  The visit at the beginning of the study included applying a survey form, assessing a 3\u2010day food consumption record, a physical activity record, the SF\u201036 quality\u2010of\u2010life scale, anthropometric measurements, body composition, and collecting the initial blood and fecal samples. These were repeated at the end of the study (except for the survey). The timeline of the study is summarized in Figure 1 .   FIGURE 1   Timeline of the study.       2.3  Kefir used in the study  In this study, traditional kefir produced with grains by Danem, Inc. ( kefirdanem.com , Suleyman Demirel University Technopark, Isparta, Turkey) was used. This kefir was preferred for reasons such as its high diversity of microorganisms and the fact that its content information is shared by the company. The composition of the microbial population can be given as follows: Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens , Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum , Lactobacillus kefiri , Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus parakefiri , Lactobacillus bulgaricus , Lactobacillus reuteri , Lactobacillus casei , Lactobacillus fermentum , Lactobacillus helveticus , Lactococcus lactis , Leuconostoc mesentereoides , Bifidobacterium bifidum , Streptococcus thermophilus , Kluyveromyces marxianus , Kluyveromyces lactis , Acetobacter pasteurianus , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The count of the microbial population, on the other hand, can be given as follows: Lactobacillus spp.: 10.54 log kob/mL; Lactococcus spp.: 10.62 log kob/mL; and yeast: 2.69 log kob/mL (G\u00fczel\u2010Seydim & K\u00f6k Ta\u015f, 2024 ). Analyses regarding the microorganism content of the kefir used in the research are carried out regularly by the company mentioned above, and the results of the analyses are similar to each other. Various study results regarding kefir have also been published by the company's founders (G\u00f6k\u0131rmakl\u0131 & G\u00fczel\u2010Seydim, 2022 ; K\u00f6k Ta\u015f et\u00a0al., 2012 ).    2.4  Anthropometrical measurements and body composition  Individuals' body weight measurements were measured using a Tanita BC 532 brand device, and height measurements were measured using a Leicester brand stadiometer. Body compositions were taken using the Inbody S10 bioelectrical impedance analysis device. As a result of the measurement of the device, individuals' total body water (L), intracellular and extracellular fluid (L), body fat percentage (%), body cell mass (kg), fat mass (kg), skeletal muscle mass (kg), and lean body mass (kg) values were recorded.    2.5  The short\u2010form 36 questionnaire ( SF \u201036)  For the purpose of evaluating the quality of life of the participants, SF\u201036 was administered twice in total, at the beginning and end of the 8\u2010week follow\u2010up period. The scale developed by Ware and Sherbourne\u00a0( 1992 ) has 8 subscales (social function, physical function, pain, physical role limitation, emotional role limitation, mental health, vitality (energy), and general perception of health) and 36 items. The scale gives a total score for every subscale separately, and the scores vary between 0 and 100. Higher scores on the scale indicate better health status, while lower scores reflect poorer health status (Ko\u00e7yigit et\u00a0al., 1999 ; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992 ).    2.6  Biochemical assessment  Blood samples were taken after an 8\u2010h overnight fast at the baseline (week 0) and the end of the study (week 8). Serum fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL\u2010C), high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL\u2010C), total cholesterol, and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) from blood samples were analyzed according to conventional laboratory standard methods. Another tube of blood sample was centrifuged, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis. Using the BT LAB kit from this blood, IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and zonulin were studied with an enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total Oxidant Status (TOS) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) analyses were performed using the Rel Assay kit. MDA levels, on the other hand, were measured using the thiobarbituric acid test method. Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA\u2010IR) was computed with the formula \u201cthe fasting insulin level (mU/L) \u00d7 fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL)/405.\u201d The oxidative stress index (OSI), an indicator of the degree of oxidative stress, is computed by dividing the TOS value by TAS (Harma & Erel, 2003 ; Kosecik et\u00a0al., 2005 ).    2.7  Fecal DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis  The participants' stool samples were collected from different parts of the stool in sterile tubes twice, at the beginning and the end of the study, and were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analyzed. In all images regarding microbiota analysis in the study, Before Treatment (BT) refers to the period before the intervention, and Post\u2010Treatment (PT) refers to the period after the intervention.  The DiaRex\u00ae Stool Genomic DNA Extraction Kit was used for stool samples. After adding 250\u2009\u03bcL Stool Lysis (SLD) solution onto an average of 25\u201350\u2009mg stool sample, 10 zircon beads and 15\u2009mg glass were added, and the application was made in the homogenizer device at 4000\u2009rpm for 2\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009s. After homogenization, 25\u2009\u03bcL of Proteinase K (PKD) was added. Next, it was incubated at 56\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. After incubation, the entire content was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5\u2009min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Afterwards, 200\u2009\u03bcL of Lysis (LBD) solution was added to the supernatant and incubated at 70\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. After incubation, 250\u2009\u03bcL of absolute ethanol was added to the lysate, and the entire content was transferred to the column. The column was centrifuged at 8000 g \u00d7\u20091\u2009min and then transferred to a new tube. Following this, after washing in accordance with the kit protocol, 100\u2009\u03bcL of elution (EBD) was added and incubated for 2\u2009min. Genomic DNA was obtained by centrifuging at 8000 g \u00d7\u20091\u2009min.  The extracted DNA was amplified with 16S V3\u2010V4 314F\u2010860R primer sets. Library preparation, on the other hand, was handled with the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit and indexes (Illumina). Pooled libraries cleaned by specific size selection were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter). Following library preparation, the MiSeq (Illumina) instrument was used to run sequencing.  Pair\u2010end Illumina reads (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009250) were significant to the QIIME2 environment (Bolyen et\u00a0al., 2019 ). All of the samples have more than 100\u00d7 sequence depth, and no samples were removed from the study. Chimera detection and quality clipping were implemented through the QIIME2 Dada2 pipeline (via q2\u2010dada2) (Callahan et\u00a0al., 2016 ). Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) were created by excluding parts with quality scores below 30. Taxonomic tables were created by mapping the obtained ASVs with the Silva 138 ( https://www.arb\u2010silva.de/documentation/release\u2010138/ ) database (Schloss, 2021 ; Werner et\u00a0al., 2012 ). For biostatistical analyses and data visualization, files created with QIIME2 were processed using the R 4.1 programming language in R Studio (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013 ; R Core Team, 2013 ). Alpha diversity assessment was interpreted using Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1. The p \u2010values between groups were calculated with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (Kruskal & Wallis, 1952 ). Beta diversity analysis was calculated based on unweighted and weighted unifracs (Lozupone et\u00a0al., 2007 ; Lozupone & Knight, 2005 ). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) was made between groups to indicate statistically significant taxonomies (Segata et\u00a0al., 2011 ). In the LEfSe analysis, LDA scores above 2 were considered significant.    2.8  Statistical analysis  The data obtained from the study were evaluated and interpreted using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) 22.0 package program. While qualitative variables are given as numbers (S) and percentages (%), quantitative variables are expressed as mean ( X \u00af ), standard deviation (SD), and median (min\u2010max). The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used to evaluate compliance with normal distribution, and when comparing two dependent groups, the paired samples t \u2010test was used for those with a normal distribution and the Wilcoxon test for those not suitable for a normal distribution. In all statistical evaluations, p <\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant.    2.9  Ethical approval  The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Gazi University of Ankara/Turkey (February 21, 2022, Decision no: 156). In addition, participants signed a consent form stating that they participated voluntarily.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Characteristics of study participants  The average age of the participants is 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.44\u2009years, and 64.7% are single (not shown in the table). There were no significant differences in body composition, dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, and physical activity levels before and post\u2010treatment (Table 1 ).

Accordingly, no significant change was observed in the beta and alpha diversity indexes.

Krona displays of the participants before and after the intervention are shown in Figure 3 . Accordingly, it was determined that the most dominant species before the intervention belonged to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, respectively, and after the intervention, they belonged to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, respectively. It was observed that after the intervention, the relative abundances of Firmicutes (BT: 65.9%; PT: 69.2%) and Actinobacteria (BT: 1.8%; PT: 3.6%) increased, while the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes (BT: 28.0%; PT:23.8) and Proteobacteria (BT: 2.9%; PT: 1.8%) decreased. It was determined that the phylum Verrucomicribia (BT: 0.9%; PT: 0.7%) remained similar throughout the study period. No significant difference was observed at the phylum level after 8\u2009weeks of intervention ( p >\u2009.05).   FIGURE 3   Krona displays.

The Krona chart features a red\u2010green color gradient signifying average e\u2010values of BLAST hits within each taxon (Ondov et\u00a0al., 2011 ).     Before and after the intervention, the class with the highest relative abundance, Clostridia (BT: 63.2%; PT: 65.8%), increased, and Bacteroidia (BT: 28.0%; PT: 23.6%), decreased. When other classes were examined, a decrease in the Gammaproteobacteria (BT: 2.3%; PT: 1.0%) class and an increase in the Actinobacteria (BT: 1.0%; PT: 2.8%) and Bacilli (BT: 0.8%; PT: 1.8%) classes were determined. The relative abundances of Erysipelotrichi (BT: 1.9%; PT:1.6%) and Verrucomicrobiae (BT:0.9%; PT:0.7%) remained similar. The change was found to be statistically significant for Bacilli from these classes ( p <\u2009.05) (Figure 4a ). The order of those with the highest relative abundance at the genus level is Prevotella , Bacteroides , Faecalibacterium , Oscillospira , Gemmiger , and Dialister before the intervention, and Bacteroides , Prevotella , Faecalibacterium , Oscillospira , Blautia , and Dialister after the intervention. At the genus level, the decrease in Holdemania and the increase in Lactococcus during the study period are statistically significant ( p <\u2009.05) (Figure 4b ).

Figure 5 shows the results of the LEfSe analysis performed on the participants' fecal samples taken before and post\u2010treatment. After the treatment, the Bacilli class ( p =\u2009.048) and its Lactococcus genus ( p =\u2009.009) significantly increased; the Holdemania genus ( p =\u2009.011) from the Erysipelotrichia class decreased ( p <\u2009.05).

In addition, this study is thought to be very important as it is the first study to evaluate the effects of kefir, which has been shown to have many health benefits in different disease groups, on PCOS.  Quality of life is significant for well\u2010being and health (Trent et\u00a0al., 2002 ). PCOS has significant effects on the quality of life, and the deterioration in their quality of life seems remarkable compared to healthy women (Moreira et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Relatedly, in a study conducted with 440 women with PCOS in Pakistan, SF\u201012 was used to evaluate the quality of life of women. The majority of patients (85%) exhibited low quality\u2010of\u2010life scores, and depression was identified as the factor most contributing to low quality\u2010of\u2010life scores (Sidra et\u00a0al., 2019 ). In this study, individuals' quality of life was evaluated with SF\u201036. Accordingly, when the quality of life of PCOS was examined by subcategories, it was found that physical function and mental health scores showed a statistically significant improvement after the intervention (Table 1 ). This is a positive result; however, it is still thought that randomized controlled studies are needed to reveal this effect more clearly.  The health risks associated with PCOS extend beyond physical health (Alur\u2010Gupta et\u00a0al., 2024 ). It shows the development of mental health problems with PCOS (Alur\u2010Gupta et\u00a0al., 2024 ; Hu et\u00a0al., 2024 ), and this situation can aggravate the pathological process of PCOS and make treatment difficult (Hu et\u00a0al., 2024 ). A meta\u2010analysis on the subject emphasized the prevalence of anxiety and depression in PCOS, which suggests that there is a need to raise awareness about the psychosocial needs of women with PCOS (Yin et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Fermented foods may be a treatment strategy for mental health problems such as depression or anxiety (Aslam et\u00a0al., 2020 ). When some studies on physical function were examined, it was seen that physical function scores were higher in individuals who were more compliant with the energy\u2010restricted Mediterranean diet (Galilea\u2010Zabalza et\u00a0al., 2018 ) or after essential amino acid supplementation (Rondanelli et\u00a0al., 2011 ). A prominent component of the Mediterranean diet and a source of antioxidants, kefir also contains essential amino acids. Due to these properties, it may have increased physical function in this study.  Having antioxidant activity, kefir can be considered a potential candidate for beneficial natural antioxidant supplementation in humans (Liu et\u00a0al., 2005 ; Vieira, de Sousa, et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Vieira, Rosario, et\u00a0al., 2021 ). During the microbial fermentation of kefir, several organic compounds, such as bacteriocins, bioactive peptides, antibiotics, exopolysaccharides, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, carbon dioxide, and other vitamins (B1, B12), as well as amino acids and calcium peptides, are produced (Saleem et\u00a0al., 2023 ). Thanks to these components, kefir is associated with several nutraceutical benefits such as antioxidative, antidiabetic, anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypercholesterolemic, and antihypertensive (Azizi et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Kefir also exhibits anti\u2010inflammatory activity by inhibiting the activity of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines like IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2 (Hamida et\u00a0al., 2021 ). A recently published systematic review including 23 studies also showed that kefir consumption reduces inflammation through the switch between T helper (Th)1 and Th2 responses, decreasing the levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and increasing the levels of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines (Albuquerque Pereira et\u00a0al., 2024 ).  Gooruee et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2023 ) evaluated the effect of kefir intervention on inflammation in COVID\u201019 patients using CRP and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) markers. Consuming kefir twice a day (250\u2009mL each time) for 2\u2009weeks resulted in a significant decrease in ESR but did not significantly affect CRP (Gooruee et\u00a0al., 2023 ). In a study examining TAS and TOS levels, 6\u2009weeks of kefir consumption did not cause a significant change in the TOS levels of healthy men, but it significantly increased the TAS levels (Diken et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Similar findings have been demonstrated in animal studies. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were divided into 3 groups to evaluate the effect of kefir group receiving 1\u2009mL kefir/day (those with metabolic syndrome), positive control receiving 1\u2009mL saline solution/day, and negative control receiving 1\u2009mL saline solution/day (those without metabolic syndrome), and the rats were followed up with standard feed and water ad\u00a0libitum for 10\u2009weeks. A decrease in IL\u20101\u03b2 and an increase in IL\u201010 were observed in the kefir group compared to the positive control. A decrease in oxidation products like hydroperoxides and MDA was also noted in the kefir group (Rosa et\u00a0al., 2016 ). In hyperglycemic Wistar rats, plain kefir supplementation caused a statistically significant decrease in IL\u20106 and IL\u20101; a non\u2010significant decrease in TNF\u2010\u03b1; and an increase in IL\u201010 (Hadisaputro et\u00a0al., 2012 ). In another study in rats, lower IL\u20106, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2 expression and higher IL\u201010 were observed in the group given kefir in addition to experimental periodontitis, compared to experimental periodontitis (Vieira, de Sousa, et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Vieira, Rosario, et\u00a0al., 2021 ). In the studies conducted on different groups of rats, TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels were found to be lower in groups treated with kefir (Ekici et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Sunita et\u00a0al., 2023 ). In this study, while a statistically non\u2010significant decrease was observed in MDA, TOS, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 ( p >\u2009.05), the decrease in IL\u20106 was found to be statistically significant ( p <\u2009.05) (Table 2 ).  Some studies on the effect of kefir on the microbiota also seem promising. For example, it has been shown that kefir application can improve intestinal health in critically ill patients (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2024 ). In a study conducted on mice, oral administration of kefir in alcoholic liver disease model mice, in addition to reducing inflammatory markers and increasing antioxidant levels, also regulated the gut microbiota composition (Cui et\u00a0al., 2024 ). Similarly, a 4\u2010week kefir intervention was also associated with some positive changes in mice. Kefir increased catalase, superoxide dismutase (colon), and SCFAs in feces (butyrate) and the brain (butyrate and propionate). It has been shown that kefir contributes to the protection of intestinal and brain health by positively affecting the gut\u2010microbiota\u2010brain axis (Albuquerque Pereira, Morais de \u00c1vila, et\u00a0al., 2023 ). Similar results have also been supported by different studies (Albuquerque Pereira, de \u00c1vila, et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Ye et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  In this study, participants' Bacilli class ( p =\u2009.048) and its Lactococcus genus ( p =\u2009.009) significantly increased after the intervention; the Holdemania genus from the Erysipelotrichia class ( p =\u2009.011) decreased ( p <\u2009.05) (Figure 5 ). Bacilli enter the gastrointestinal tract with probiotic preparations, water, and food (Ilinskaya et\u00a0al., 2017 ). The ability to produce numerous antimicrobial compounds, secretory proteins, enzymes, carotenoids, and vitamins indicates the significance of Bacilli in the food chain (Elshaghabee et\u00a0al., 2017 ). The genera Bacillus and Lactobacillus , two representatives of the Bacilli class, can considerably affect both the whole body and the intestinal microbiota because of the wide range of compounds they secrete despite their small proportions in the microbiome composition (Ilinskaya et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Another genus of this class, Lactococcus species, is widely found in fish, other animals, and plants and is the normal biota of the gastrointestinal tract. They are accepted as beneficial and harmless because of their probiotic properties (Onyeaka & Nwabor, 2022 ). Lactococcus , together with genera like Leuconostoc , Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium , and Streptococcus , constitute LAB and are found in fermented foods, especially fermented milk products (Linares et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Using the Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 strain isolated from Tibetan kefir, Wang et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2009 ) added this strain to the high\u2010cholesterol diets of rats, and as a result, they revealed an increase in the fecal bifidobacteria and LAB population (Wang et\u00a0al., 2009 ). It has been reported that PCOS was alleviated by regulating the intestinal microbiota as a result of the application of certain strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus to rats, in which a PCOS model was created with letrozole for 4\u2009weeks (He et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  Metabolites of lactic acid bacteria are significant for the intestinal microbiota (\u015ali\u017cewska et\u00a0al., 2020 ). These bacteria provide antihypertensive, anti\u2010inflammatory, antioxidative, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, and anticholesterolemic effects on the consumer and microbiome modulation (Linares et\u00a0al., 2017 ). In a study showing that the Lactococcus genus associated with these positive effects was reduced in PCOS patients, the abundance of the Lactococcus genus was reported to be significantly lower in non\u2010obese women with PCOS compared to healthy women (Zhou, Ni, Cheng, et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Related to all this, kefir, along with the Lactococcus content, may increase the relative abundance of this genus in PCOS patients, thus creating many positive health effects, especially microbiota modulation. As in the literature (Kesmen & Kacmaz, 2011 ; Zanirati et\u00a0al., 2015 ), the presence of Lactococcus lactis in the kefir used in this study may have caused the increase in the Lactococcus genus after kefir consumption.   Holdemania , on the other hand, is in the form of anaerobic, non\u2010spore\u2010forming rods and is a genus belonging to the Erysipelotrichaceae family and Erysipelotrichia class (Willems, 2015 ). However, there is limited information about the Holdemania genus in the literature, and it is stated that its health effects are not clear (Surono et\u00a0al., 2020 ). The family of this genus, Erysipelotrichaceae, has been reported to be enriched in inflammation\u2010related diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (Kaakoush, 2015 ). Chen et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2012 ) showed that the abundance of the Erysipelotrichaceae family was increased in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012 ). In addition, in mice that developed transmural inflammation similar to another disease, TNF\u2010induced Crohn's disease, the authors reported significant increases in Erysipelotrichaceae abundance (Schaubeck et\u00a0al., 2016 ). In another study, the authors compared HIV\u2010uninfected controls and patients with chronic HIV infection receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy. In conclusion, they observed that the relative abundance of Erysipelotrichi was positively correlated with TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (Dinh et\u00a0al., 2015 ). Based on this, it can be said that the significant decrease in the Holdemania genus after the intervention may have created a positive microbiota composition change through inflammation; however, all genera belonging to a family or class cannot have similar characteristics. In fact, it should not be ignored that although many breeds are cited with negative or positive characteristics in the literature, there may also be studies showing the opposite.    5  CONCLUSIONS  As a result, to our knowledge, this was the first study exploring the effect of kefir on women with PCOS. This study indicated that consuming 250\u2009mL of traditional kefir per day for 2\u2009months could provide some positive changes in PCOS. Quality of life in the mental health and physical function categories significantly increased, and IL\u20106 significantly decreased. Regarding microbiota composition, the relative abundance of the Bacilli class and its Lactococcus genus significantly increased, while the Holdemania genus decreased at the end of the study. The main treatment step for PCOS is lifestyle change, and based on these results, we think that kefir added to the diet may help reduce the risks of late\u2010term complications of PCOS by providing positive health outcomes. Further studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of kefir on the microbiota and various health outcomes of women with PCOS, considering the limitations of this study.   5.1  Strengths and limitations  Information on the microbiota composition of the kefirs used in the studies is not presented for each study, so it is not possible to talk about standardization among all studies. Also, it is clear that the type and amount of microorganisms contained in kefir, the study population, and the study duration are factors that can directly affect the study results. The strengths of this study include the use of traditionally produced kefir and the knowledge of the diversity of microorganisms it contains. Therefore, these confounding factors should be considered when planning future studies and interpreting the study results.
