We recruited participants using medical records from an academic medical center. Twenty-nine overweight or obese women (body mass index, 25\u201350 kg/m We taught participants to follow a VLC diet and provided information about a variety of behavioral skills including mindfulness and positive affect using an online 16-week intervention. Changes in body weight, glycated hemoglobin, and PCOS-related quality of life. The intervention led to positive health outcomes including decreases in percent weight (mean difference = \u22127.67, SD = 6.10) and glycated hemoglobin level (mean difference = \u22120.21%, SD = 0.27), an increase in sex hormone binding globulin level (mean difference = 9.24 nmol/L, SD\u00a0=\u00a016.34), and increases in PCOS-related quality of life measures, including menstrual predictability (mean difference = 2.10, SD = 2.76) and body hair (mean difference = 1.14, SD = 1.04). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased (mean difference = 0.23 mmol/L, SD = 0.49). The results suggest that a VLC dietary intervention has potential to promote both weight loss and glycemic control in overweight and obese adults with PCOS, two key components in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

The recommended guidelines for diagnosis of PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria requires the exclusion of other diagnoses known to cause ovulatory dysfunction or hyperandrogenism and the inclusion of at least two of the following three manifestations: ovulatory dysfunction; hyperandrogenism; and polycystic ovaries ( 2 ). Polycystic ovary syndrome significantly impairs fertility and quality of life in addition to increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. The risk of type 2 diabetes is three to seven times higher in women with PCOS ( 2 ), and for obese women with PCOS, the risk is even higher ( 3 ).  Lifestyle modification to bring about weight loss is a key recommendation for women with PCOS in position statements from the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society ( 4 , 5 ), Endocrine Society\u2019s clinical practice guidelines ( 6 ), and international evidence-based guidelines ( 7 ). Weight loss may improve both reproductive and metabolic outcomes. It typically reduces insulin levels, insulin resistance, and androgen levels, each of which may contribute to improved ovulatory function, pregnancy rates, live birth rates, and glycemic control ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 ).  Despite this consensus in recommendations for lifestyle-driven weight loss, experts disagree on the ideal dietary approach for PCOS, including whether a lower carbohydrate diet may be beneficial ( 4 , 10 ). Carbohydrates have been shown to increase insulin secretion, which then stimulates ovarian androgen production and inhibits the release of fatty acids from cells; the hyperinsulinemia present in PCOS likely contributes to hyperandrogenism ( 11 , 12 ). Thus, reducing insulin levels through diet may provide a critical nonpharmacologic treatment option for women with PCOS ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ). A very-low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet may be able to lower insulin levels and be effective for weight loss ( 17 ).  We, therefore, conducted a 4-month, 16-session, single-arm prospective pilot study using a VLC diet intervention in overweight and obese women with PCOS to test the hypothesis that a VLC diet would lead to clinically significant weight loss (primary outcome), improvements in glucose control (secondary outcome), as well as other health improvements. To assist with dietary adherence and promote improved mental health, we integrated the dietary component of the intervention with positive affect practices, on the basis of the positive pathways to health theoretical model ( 18 ) and mindful eating strategies, which, among other effects, may reduce hedonic eating, a significant barrier for following dietary advice ( 19 ).   Materials and methods  Potential participants were identified from electronic outpatient medical records at Michigan Medicine, a large health care system in Southeastern Michigan, United States. The inclusion criteria focused on a subtype of PCOS, based on a self-reported diagnosis of PCOS together with the presence of medically documented hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea\u2013anovulation (for women not on birth control). Hyperandrogenism was defined as an elevated total testosterone level of \u226550 ng/dL or free androgen index of >1.5 (ratio of testosterone/sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG] \u00d7 100) or self-reported severe acne or hirsutism for those not currently on hormonal birth control and a history from the prior 10 years of an elevated total testosterone level of \u226550 ng/dL or free androgen index of >1.5 (ratio of testosterone/SHBG \u00d7 100) or severe acne or hirsutism for those currently on hormonal birth control. Oligomenorrhea\u2013anovulation was defined as spontaneous intermenstrual periods of \u226545 days or a total of \u22648 menses per year. Additionally, records reviewed for up to 10 years or baseline results were used to rule out other causes of hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction: total testosterone level of <100 ng/dL, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level of <600 \u03bcg/dL, fasting 17-hydroxyprogesterone level of <2.0 ng/mL, hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of <25 ng/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone levels of <20 mIU/mL (optional). Additional inclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) of 25\u201350 kg/m 2 , age of 21\u201340 years, regular access to the internet, ability to engage in light physical activity, willingness to engage with the intervention, and approval of participation by their primary care provider or PCOS specialist. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the next 6 months; breastfeeding or less than 6 months postpartum; type 1 or 2 diabetes; and planned or a history of weight loss surgery. Preliminary eligibility was confirmed by an online screening survey. Additionally, participants were asked to fill out an online consent form, complete a more detailed online survey about their physical and psychological well-being, and perform a 3-day food diary using MyFitnessPal (Under Armour, Inc.). Participants went to one of over 20 of the Michigan Medicine health system\u2019s MLabs for their baseline blood draw to confirm their eligibility and weighed themselves on a scale we mailed to them from BodyTrace (San Francisco, CA). After 4 months, participants repeated the online survey, 3-day food diary, blood draw, and self-weighing.  The intervention was entirely remotely delivered and a technology-supported multicomponent program. It consisted of instructional multimedia modules provided via e-mail every week for 16 weeks. A description of each module is presented in Table\u00a01 . The weekly e-mails included a short survey to assess adherence and health concerns, short embedded videos to teach the weekly topics, downloadable handouts, and links to external resources on the web. For those who preferred not to watch videos, transcripts were provided in a portable document format. The modules were not live-streamed and remained indefinitely viewable for participants at a time convenient for them. Modules tended to require approximately 10\u201330 minutes to complete.

We advised participants to reduce their carbohydrate intake to 20\u201335 net (nonfiber) grams per day, maintain their current protein intake within the requirements suggested by the Institute of Medicine ( 23 ), and derive their remaining calories from fat. Common foods included animal foods (e.g., cheeses, meats, and eggs), healthy fats, nuts, seeds, and low-carbohydrate vegetables and fruits. Additional components to assist participants with behavior change included the following: dietary self-monitoring using MyFitnessPal (optional throughout the trial but strongly encouraged, required for 3 days at baseline and month 4); body weight self-monitoring using a digital scale; goals for physical activity and sleep; training in positive affect and mindfulness; text messages; mailed materials (cookbooks and urine ketone strips); menus; and social support through existing online support groups, similar to our previous research in type 2 diabetes ( 21 , 22 ). The diet coach (R.M.) contacted participants at least every other week and provided personalized feedback and encouragement; she was also available via e-mail for participant questions at any time. The project PI (L.R.S.) edited all messages for clarity and accuracy before the coach sent them to participants. The research was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, HUM00113697.   Outcomes   Weight and metabolic outcomes  The primary outcome was body weight loss with exploratory metabolic outcomes including changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hormones, and lipids. The results were converted to International System of Units per standard protocols. We used a remote scale for body weight measurements because this has been found to be correlated .99 with in-person, clinic-based measurements ( 24 , 25 ).    Psychological outcomes  We assessed PCOS health-related quality of life, including subscales related to menstrual symptoms, menstrual predictability, emotions, body hair, and infertility ( 26 ); Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures of global physical and mental health as well as fatigue and sleep ( 27 ); and the Food Craving Inventory, which assesses cravings for unsweetened carbohydrates/starches (e.g., corn bread, popcorn, rolls, biscuits, sandwich bread, rice, baked potato, and pasta) and sweets (e.g., brownies, cookies, candy, chocolate, donuts, cake, cinnamon rolls, ice cream, pancakes or waffles, and breakfast cereal) ( 28 ). We further assessed three factors that prior research has shown to mediate weight loss achieved with programs employing mindfulness techniques similar to those used in the current study ( 19 , 29 , 30 ). We, therefore, assessed reward-based eating, or the lack of control over eating, lack of satiety, and preoccupation with food (e.g., \u201cI feel out of control in the presence of delicious food\u201d) ( 31 ); body responsiveness, or responsiveness to bodily sensations, including perceived disconnection between psychological and physical processes and the importance of interoceptive awareness or listening to bodily sensations for self-regulation (e.g., \u201cI am confident that my body will let me know what is good for me\u201d) ( 32 ); and mindful eating, or the nonjudgmental awareness of physical and emotional sensations associated with eating (e.g., \u201cI notice when there are subtle flavors in the foods I eat\u201d) ( 33 ).    Self-reported diet  Participants used MyFitnessPal to report their daily food consumption, from which total calories and net carbohydrates were calculated (total carbohydrates minus fiber). Participants tracked their diet for 3 days at both baseline and the 4-month follow-up. To avoid days that were only partially recorded, we included only days that the tracked caloric intake was at least 500 kcal ( 34 ). We mailed participants urinary acetoacetate test kits (to test for a ketone that can be measured in urine; Ketostix, Abbott) and asked whether they observed ketones in their urine during the first month of the intervention.    Changes in prescribed medication  Participants reported on any changes in what diabetes medications they were prescribed.    Intervention feasibility and acceptability  We assessed intervention feasibility by examining our ability to reach our recruitment target (approximately 30 participants), maintain enrollment, and limit loss to follow-up. Satisfaction with the program was rated from 1, not at all satisfied, to 7, very satisfied . To assess potential acceptability, we also asked participants to answer, \u201cHow long can you see yourself following your assigned diet?\u201d In the 4-month survey for all participants, we asked open-ended questions for the participants\u2019 perspectives about the program and its impact. We also invited all participants to take part in a phone interview.     Statistical Analysis   Quantitative  The primary outcome, change in body weight from baseline to 4 months, was measured by percent weight loss as well as by the percentage of participants who lost a clinically significant amount of weight, defined as at least 5%. Previous research suggests that a variety of health conditions, such as hypertension and fertility, improve with only 5% weight loss, and thus, 5% has become the standard level for clinically significant weight loss ( 35 ). When reporting the proportion of participants who met weight reduction thresholds, we conservatively used the total sample size assuming that participants who did not complete the program did not achieve the threshold. This imputation method was also used for self-report of dietary adherence and presence of ketones in the urine. We examined histograms, quantile\u2013quantile plots, and skewness statistics to ascertain whether our quantitative outcomes and changes in those outcomes were normally distributed. The baseline summary characteristics for quantitative variables included means and SDs for variables that were normally distributed and medians and interquartile range for skewed variables. To examine differences between participants who completed the intervention and follow-up and those who dropped out or were lost to follow-up, we used independent t tests for normally distributed variables, the Mann-Whitney rank tests for skewed distributions, and the \u03c7 2 tests for proportions. To test our hypotheses that the intervention changed outcomes over time, we used paired t tests when the before and after differences had a normal distribution and the Wilcoxon signed rank tests when the differences were skewed. We performed all analyses using Stata version 16. We completed an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data (no imputation for missing data; in this case similar to a completer\u2019s analysis) and a per-protocol analysis for participants who adhered to the intervention protocol. We defined adherence as reporting a score of 5 or higher (scale of 1\u20137) for the level of dietary adherence on a minimum of 13 out of the 16 weekly check-ins.    Qualitative  We interviewed a subset of participants over the phone 1\u20132 months after they had completed the trial. These semistructured interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed with a thematic approach. Two coders analyzed the transcripts using NVivo 12 Plus software, independently reviewing the same three transcripts to create preliminary codes, identifying themes and patterns throughout the interviews. Through discussion between coders and the project PI (L.R.S.), a final thematic coding structure was developed. Coders applied this structure to all transcripts, double coding six and independently coding the remaining eight, meeting to discuss discrepancies regularly. Once all transcripts were coded, codes were categorized by broader themes through discussion to consensus. We also explored the open-ended 4-month online survey responses.      Results  Of the 29 women with PCOS recruited (all during 2019), 21 (72.4%) completed both baseline and 4-month measurements. Because this was a pilot study, the sample size was not calculated to provide adequate power to detect group difference. The study participant flowchart is provided in Figure\u00a01 . The participants were 82.76% White, 3.45% Asian, 10.34% Black or African American, and 3.45% with a Hispanic ethnicity. The mean age was 31.21 years (SD = 5.13), seven participants (24%) were on birth control at baseline (three oral contraceptive pills, three hormonal intrauterine devices, and one copper intrauterine device), and all lived in Southeast Michigan. The summary characteristics of the sample at baseline are presented in Table\u00a02 . Of the eight (27.5%) individuals who did not complete the study, one dropped out of the study (no reason provided), and the other seven engaged to varying degrees throughout the study but did not complete follow-up measurements (lost to follow-up, no reason provided). There were no significant statistical differences in retention by baseline age, weight, BMI, HbA1c, glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment 2 for insulin resistance, androgens, or metabolic markers, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.

Weight and Metabolic Outcomes  Table\u00a03 summarizes the effects from 0 to 4 months in all participants with final outcomes as well as per-protocol participants. We aimed to reduce bias by having outcomes assessed by masked assessors, to reduce assessor bias. The mean percent weight loss was 7.67% (SD = 6.10, t = \u22126.16, P <.001), with 15 of 29 participants (51.72%) losing at least 5% of their body weight, 14 of 29 participants (48%) losing at least 7% of their body weight, and 10 of 29 participants (34%) losing at least 10% of their body weight. The mean BMI reduction among the intention-to-treat participants was 2.64 kg/m 2 (SD = 2.14, t = \u22126.05, P <.001). In addition to these statistically significant reductions in body weight and BMI, we observed statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and SHBG.

The results were converted from conventional units to International System of Units. A paired t -test was used when the differences between before and after were normal distributions; the Wilcoxon signed rank was used when the differences between before and after were skewed distributions (noted with a ). The per-protocol analysis included the 15 participants we rated as adhering to the intervention. BMI = body mass index; HbA1c = glycated hemoglobin; HDL = high-density lipoprotein; HOMA2-IR = homeostatic model assessment 2 for insulin resistance; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; N = number; PCOSQ = The Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire; PROMIS = Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; SD = standard deviation; SHBG = sex hormone binding globulin.    Psychological Aspects  Overall, all measured psychological aspects improved in the whole sample, and nearly all improved in the per-protocol subanalysis ( Table\u00a03 ).    Dietary Self-Report  Participants significantly reduced both total calories and net (nonfiber) grams of carbohydrates. Most participants (25 out of 29) observed ketones in their urine during the first month of the intervention, and 15 out of 29 met our criteria for adherence on the weekly self-report survey, which was used to complete the per-protocol analysis, for which results were largely similar ( Table\u00a03 ).    Medication Changes  Twelve of the 21 study completers (57 %) reported taking metformin at the start of the study. Of these, one increased her dose, and one stopped for reasons unrelated to treatment. Three women reported taking spironolactone at baseline. One increased their dose during the first week of the study, one remained on the same dose, and one stopped that medication.    Intervention Feasibility and Acceptability  After 9 days, 13% of those we mailed as part of trial recruitment had filled out an online screening survey expressing interest, and we were able to make our recruitment target with that initial group. Among participants who answered the follow-up survey (n = 21), program satisfaction was high (median = 7.00 on a 7-point scale, interquartile range = 1.0), and everyone reported a score of 5 or higher. Only 14% (3/21) reported that they would stop the assigned diet as soon as the study was over, with all the rest reporting that they intended to continue the diet for at least another few months, and 48% (10/21) stated that they did not plan to ever stop following a VLC diet.    Adverse Events  Several adverse events were reported throughout the course of this trial. Two participants developed kidney stones, one within 2 weeks of starting the intervention and the other 2 months into the intervention. A different participant reported continuous muscle cramping and blurry vision 2 months into the intervention; symptoms subsided after consulting with their physician.    Qualitative Findings  Through the subsequent thematic analysis of interviews ( Supplemental document , available online) with 14 participants and 21 open-ended survey responses, several themes emerged. We report the most prominent themes here.   Subjective changes in health  Participants experienced a variety of positive health changes, including weight loss, improved glucose control, increased energy and menstrual regularity, and reduced \u201cbrain fog,\u201d abdominal pain, acne, facial hair, heart burn, and premenstrual syndrome. Some negative health changes included transitory headaches, muscle cramps, trouble sleeping, menstrual irregularity, and two participants who reported kidney stones.   Weight loss  Several participants positively commented on their significant weight loss. One lost so much weight that she was no longer eligible for gastric bypass surgery: \u201cI was considering the bypass surgery\u2026 I did start to go through some of the checklist items and I\u2019m like, I really don\u2019t want to do this but if, you know, if this is the last resort because other diets weren\u2019t working for me\u2026 that\u2019s when I was meeting with [my physician]\u2026 So now I\u2019m no longer eligible to be a part of that. <laughs> So I\u2019m like, well, that\u2019s great.\u201d    Menstrual regularity  Participants had improvements in their menstrual cycles, including naturally spontaneous menstrual cycles not brought on by medication. One participant said she was \u201cgetting a cycle every month which I haven\u2019t gotten in almost, I would say, it\u2019s been 9 years.\u201d Another said she learned to \u201ctake back control over my body. Polycystic ovary syndrome can make you feel a little alienated from your own body because of symptoms, hormone fluctuations, pain, and irregularity. When I closely stuck to the diet, I was actually quickly noticing an improvement in all of those things.\u201d    Skin improvements  Participants described having less acne and improved skin, such as \u201cI started seeing my skin glow.\u201d Another stated, \u201cMy complexion has never been, ever, ever, never not since I was maybe 11 have I had times where I\u2019ve not had like a blemish, and I have that today\u2026I have also had a reduction in the deep cystic acne I would get in my thighs, armpits chest and back.\u201d    Glucose control  Participants had improved glucose control and steady glucose levels, and some were able to stop taking their metformin. One explained, \u201cMy blood sugar when I started and before that even was prediabetic and now I\u2019m not prediabetic. [The program] changed my whole health, so I\u2019m grateful.\u201d Another described her motivation to join the study and the positive effects after participating, saying, \u201cI needed to lose some weight and I was very worried about my A1C and my blood sugar, and I did not like the metformin; it has weird side effects. So, I wanted to figure out a way to change my lifestyle so that I wouldn\u2019t have to take it forever\u2026.That\u2019s what the study has done for me because\u2026 I don\u2019t have to take my metformin anymore, and I feel better than I have in years with no GI [gastrointestinal] distress. There\u2019s no more fatigue after eating. I don\u2019t have any blood sugar spikes. It\u2019s just great.\u201d     Altered beliefs about food  Several participants discussed changing thoughts on food, with one participant observing that she went \u201cfrom the place of where I\u2019m sugar addicted to being not dependent on sugar. So, just going to food for nourishment and enjoying the flavors.\u201d Another noted, \u201cI learned that I [had been] using snacks as a coping mechanism a lot, so I\u2019ve been feeling better about knowing when to eat and how much.\u201d Some described how learning about the physiological impact of food was beneficial, such as \u201c\u2026understanding the role that insulin and sugar plays in my weight has been incredibly helpful for me. I feel that knowing this will help me continue to stay on track. Some people are lactose intolerant; I feel like I am sugar intolerant.\u201d  One participant was surprised about \u201chow tasteful the food is in this program. Following the recipes and adding more vegetables to my diet, that\u2019s been really surprising, because vegetables aren\u2019t exactly really good-tasting\u2026 it surprised me how good [vegetables go] with certain foods and certain proteins.\u201d Participants brought up several strategies that they used to support their dietary adherence, including preparing meals in advance, having a list of easy-to-prepare \u201cgo-to\u201d meals, learning how to read food labels, and being aware of ways to substitute ingredients to make food compatible with the meal plan. One noted, \u201cFinding the powdered pork rinds was a total game changer because then I could still make chicken fingers <laughs>, so if I wanted something totally like comfort food, it was still possible to do that.\u201d    Physician support  Participants had either neutral or positive physician support. One participant said, \u201cHe seemed interested, he was saying that he had other patients on keto who had had success with it in losing weight. But he did make a comment like, \u2018I love bread too much, I couldn\u2019t give that up,\u2019 which I think is just kind of funny. But yeah, I would say he definitely wasn\u2019t unsupportive of it.\u201d Another\u2019s physician was \u201cvery impressed\u2026 and excited because I\u2019m finally getting healthy. Over the years, he has suggested diet and exercise, which I have done but a typical calorie in, calorie out diet\u2026 I was still finding it very hard to lose weight, and it wasn\u2019t working the way he wanted it to work. So I think it always frustrated him that he\u2019d always tell me to try harder\u2026 He\u2019s now asking how I did it, how I\u2019ve lost so much weight and how I got my cholesterol down so far so quick and he wants to suggest it to other people that might be in similar conditions that I was in.\u201d      Discussion  This trial provides compelling proof of concept that an online, multicomponent VLC diet and lifestyle intervention is feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious in treating women with PCOS. Participant satisfaction was high, and numerous objective and subjective factors improved. Finally, interviewed participants noted a variety of mostly positive health changes.  For example, we observed significant improvements in body weight, which is consistent with previous trials implementing a ketogenic diet in patients with PCOS ( 16 , 36 ). Weight loss results in several key benefits for women with PCOS, including improvement of metabolic parameters, reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes ( 37 ). Previous trials have retained a similarly small number of participants, in trials between 2 and 3 months, with similar reductions in weight and improvements in glucose control. The intervention from our research is designed to be online and, therefore, easy to access, in which previous published research did not emphasize ( 35 , 38 ). Overall, this suggests that a VLC dietary intervention could be used to manage some of the negative outcomes associated with PCOS.  Our glucose control results are consistent with a previous single-arm prospective carbohydrate restriction trial in PCOS, which observed a significant reduction in HbA1c ( 38 ). Additionally, the results from our trial show a greater HbA1c reduction than was observed in a short-term trial using a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet ( 39 ). These findings may be due to the reduced postprandial glycemia and hyperinsulinemia that results from carbohydrate restriction ( 40 ).  The trial has several strengths and limitations. A strength of the trial is that we measured psychological outcomes very broadly, finding improvements in global mental health, global physical health, and PCOS-related quality of life measures, including menstrual predictability and body hair. Another strength of this trial is that the intervention is completely online, which may facilitate the feasibility of a future study that could recruit participants nationally and reach racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups often underrepresented in weight loss studies ( 41 ). In terms of limitations, although the results from this study are promising, long-term implications are unclear because of the short, 4-month timeline, small sample size, and lack of experimental control. Larger, long-term, randomized controlled trials comparing our diet with other dietary approaches are necessary to better understand the long-term feasibility and efficacy of this approach to treatment for PCOS and explore some of the outcomes such as the elevation in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level. However, during weight loss, stored cholesterol can be mobilized from adipose tissue, temporarily increasing the LDL-C level, so this is likely not a concern ( 42 ). Moreover, LDL-C is a controversial indicator of cardiovascular risk, and VLC diets typically improve outcomes more strongly related to cardiovascular risk, such as triglycerides, small dense LDL, and large buoyant LDL ( 43 ).  In addition, our participants were primarily White, and to what extent results generalize to people of color is unclear. Moreover, because this was a multicomponent program, which combined a VLC diet with a variety of other factors, such as instruction in positive affect and mindful eating skills, it is unclear which components of the intervention led to the outcomes. Additionally, other factors related to PCOS play a role in the increased insulin resistance these women experience and may not be modulated by weight loss. In future research, trials could examine the impact of this intervention for women with normal BMIs. We also did not assess how long participants had been taking metformin and whether this may have caused prior weight loss. A larger, future trial may be able to be powered to detect the potential confounding influence of metformin. Finally, the combined lost to follow-up and dropout rate for this trial was moderate (27%), although this falls within the average dropout rate (27%\u201335%) in previous diet and lifestyle studies for those diagnosed with PCOS ( 44 ). Time commitment was cited as the main reason for dropout in trials that evaluated the effects of lifestyle modification in women with PCOS ( 37 ). Further evaluation of dropout rates is needed to improve the effectiveness of future dietary interventions for PCOS.    Conclusion  Polycystic ovary syndrome is commonly diagnosed earlier in life than type 2 diabetes, as it is discovered during the early reproductive years ( 45 ). Given that PCOS is known to place women at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, early management has the potential to effectively reduce risk and prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes. This multicomponent VLC dietary intervention was feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in promoting weight loss and other positive changes in overweight patients with PCOS.",
