    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. 1 Risk factors for CVD are more prevalent and tend to cluster in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 2 , 3 This syndrome represents the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of up to 15%. 4 PCOS has been associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities such as obesity, dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, hypertension and the metabolic syndrome, which increase the risk for CVD. 5 , 6 PCOS is a syndrome characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian morphology. 7 The phenotype of PCOS is modified by body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity, generally becomes milder with increasing age, and disappears largely after menopause. 8 , 9 , 10 The cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with PCOS can, however, persist beyond the onset of menopause. 5 , 8 , 11   In the past, it was assumed that women with PCOS would be more prone to develop CVD later in life. 12 The only available long\u2010term follow\u2010up study in women with PCOS did, however, not reveal an increased risk for CVD. 6 More recent studies in postmenopausal women with features of PCOS seem to reinforce these findings. 11 , 13 At the same time, others suggest an increased incidence of CVD in women with PCOS already at an early age. 14 , 15 , 16 Whether or not women with PCOS are at increased risk to develop CVD still remains uncertain. Long before the onset of cardiovascular events, atherosclerosis can be detected. Carotid intima\u2010media thickness (cIMT) is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and can be used to predict future cardiovascular events. 17 In women with PCOS, an increased cIMT has been described, which suggests an increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis compared to the general population. 18 It remains to be determined to what extent these surrogate markers translate into real cardiovascular events later in life. 19   In addition to markers used to detect (early) signs of CVD, models have been developed to estimate cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease risk. 20 , 21 The Framingham study has provided an algorithm to predict the risk for future CVD, based on factors such as smoking, BMI and cholesterol levels. 21 At the same time, the American Heart Association has identified factors and behaviours, which improve cardiovascular health and reduce death from CVD. The simultaneous presence of ideal health factors and behaviours in an individual is associated with longevity and healthy ageing. 20 , 21 Not much is known about the performance of women with PCOS in these models.  The aim of the current study was to assess the cardiometabolic phenotype and prevalence of CVD in middle\u2010aged women previously diagnosed with PCOS, compared with age\u2010matched controls from the general population. We compared the cardiovascular profile and assessed the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis, by measuring cIMT. In addition, we assessed differences in the estimated cardiovascular health score and 10\u2010year CVD risk between the aforementioned populations.    2  METHODS   2.1  Patients  Women aged \u226540\u00a0years who were previously diagnosed with PCOS in one of the three participating university hospitals were eligible for inclusion. All patients had in the past underwent a standardized examination, involving a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, hormonal evaluation and a transvaginal ultrasonography to assess ovarian volume and follicle count. This protocol has been described in detail elsewhere 22 Diagnosis of PCOS was based on the Rotterdam criteria and established during the reproductive years. 10 According to these criteria, PCOS is diagnosed when either two or three of the key features are present: ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovarian morphology and clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism. 7 In total, around 850 women had previously been diagnosed and phenotyped by this standardized screening and by now reached the age of 40. Women with a poor ability of speaking or understanding of Dutch or English language or who were currently pregnant were excluded. All other women with PCOS aged >40 were invited to participate in the current study. Women visiting the outpatient clinic underwent an extensive endocrine and cardiovascular assessment, which included general medical, obstetric and family history, education level, smoking status and anthropometric measurements. Visualization of both carotid arteries was done using ultrasound. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University Medical Center Utrecht, University of Utrecht and registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov , registration number NCT02616510. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.    2.2  Controls  The control group was derived from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population\u2010based cohort study focusing on health and diseases in the elderly. We selected 200 women included in the third cohort of the Rotterdam Study. The third cohort includes inhabitants of the municipality of Ommoord, Rotterdam aged >45\u00a0years, and was recruited between 2006 and 2008. Participants are examined extensively at the research centre every 3\u20105\u00a0years. The rationale and design of this study have been described in detail elsewhere. 23 All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study and to obtain information from their treating physicians. The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the medical ethics committee according to the Population Screening Act: Rotterdam Study, executed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands. National trial registry number NTR6831.    2.3  Endocrine and cardiovascular assessment of women with PCOS and controls  On the day of the assessment, fasting blood samples were collected and assessed. 2 , 24 We measured cholesterols, high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL), low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride serum levels. Furthermore, insulin and glucose levels, aspartate transaminasel (ASAT) and alanine transaminase (ALAT), androgens, gonadotropins, sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG) and oestradiol (E 2 ) levels were determined. Brain natriuretic peptide (NT\u2010proBNP), a marker for heart failure, was also measured. The free androgen index was calculated as (Testosterone/SHBG)*100. Waist to hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference/hip circumference. Blood pressure was measured once in cases and twice in controls, in sitting position after at least five minutes of rest with a random\u2010zero sphygmomanometer. Insulin resistance was assessed with the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA\u2010IR). Insulin was converted to mU/L, and next, the HOMA\u2010IR was calculated as: fasting serum insulin (mU/L) x fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) /22.5. Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose level of\u00a0\u2265\u00a07.0\u00a0mmol/L, use of anti\u2010diabetic medication or self\u2010reported diagnosis. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) >139\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >89\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or use of antihypertensive medication. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) definition was used to determine the presence of the metabolic syndrome. 25 According to this definition, metabolic syndrome is present when \u22653 of the following features are present: waist circumference \u226588\u00a0cm, fasting glucose \u2265\u00a06.1\u00a0mmol/L, blood pressure >129/84\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg, high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) <1.3\u00a0mmol/L and triglycerides (TG) \u2265 1.7\u00a0mmol/L. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a 25\u2010OH\u2010D serum of <50\u00a0nmol/L.    2.4  Carotid intima\u2010media thickness for women with PCOS and controls  We used cIMT to assess subclinical atherosclerosis in middle\u2010aged women with PCOS and age\u2010matched controls from the general population. cIMT was defined as the distance between the lumen intima and the media\u2010adventitia and measured three times at both sides over 1 centimetre length and at least 0.5 centimetres proximal of the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, or at the beginning of the dilatation of the distal common carotid artery across a length of 1 centimetre. 26 , 27 , 28 The mean of the right and left carotid arteries was used for analysis. Ultrasound measurements were performed by trained professionals at the respective research centre. Multiple devices were used for ultrasound measurements. In women with PCOS, the Panasonic CardioHealthStation (Yokohoma, Japan), Esaote MyLabTMOne and the ToshibaAplioArtida Medical System were used. Measurements with the various machines yielded similar results across the different research centres (Table S1 ). In controls, the ATL UltraMark IV (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Bothell) was used.    2.5  Other measurements  Women with PCOS with FSH serum levels of >40 (U/L) in combination with an amenorrhoea were labelled as postmenopausal. In controls, postmenopausal status was self\u2010reported via questionnaire. Information on prevalent CVD (stroke, myocardial infarction and/or coronary heart disease) was self\u2010reported or obtained through general practitioners or hospital discharge reports. Smoking status was labelled as ever or never smoker. Former smokers and current smokers were grouped as \u2018ever smokers\u2019 as it was not known how long ago women had stopped smoking. Ethnicity was self\u2010reported.  The 10\u2010year CVD risk was calculated according to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), and based on age, SBP, HDL and total cholesterol, smoking and the presence of type II diabetes. 21 Low risk was defined as a 10\u2010year CVD risk <10%, 10%\u201020% as intermediate 10\u2010year CVD risk, and >20% was marked as high 10\u2010year CVD risk CVD. Next, we calculated the CHS in women with PCOS and controls. 20 The CHS was introduced by the American Heart Association and encompasses health factors (cholesterol and glucose serum levels, blood pressure and BMI) and behavioural factors (smoking, dietary intake and physical activity). Information on 5 out of the 7 factors (cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, smoking status and BMI) was available in our study population. We did not have information on dietary intake and physical activity. However, measures of these parameters have been marked to be prone to sampling variability and misclassification. 29 , 30 Therefore, we calculated a composite CHS based on the 5 available parameters and assessed the mean CHS and performance of cases and controls on each of the health metrics.    2.6  Statistical analysis  For each case, a control was age\u2010matched 1:1, from the Rotterdam study cohort, using propensity score matching (PSM) greedy approach. PSM was based on a logistic regression model that includes PCOS vs no PCOS as a dichotomous outcome and age as the only covariate under study. Hosmer\u2010Lemeshow test was used to evaluate goodness\u2010or\u2010fit of the models. Transformation of age was used based on lowess graph in order to choose the best fitting model. Standardized differences and plots of propensity scores distribution between PCOS and control group, before and after matching procedure, were made to evaluate the balance achieved.  All statistical analysis were performed with IBM SPSS statistics version 24 (IBM Corp.) and STATA version 14.2 (Station College). A two\u2010sided P <\u00a0.05 denoted statistical significance. Baseline characteristics were presented as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables and as proportions (%) for dichotomous variables. Continuous variables with a normal distribution were compared with the student t test and with Mann\u2010Whitney U for nonnormally distributed variables. Chi \u2010 square test or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables. Linear regression was used to assess cIMT. cIMT was log transformed to obtain a normal distribution. Results were expressed as regression coefficients (\u03b2) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). To eliminate the effect of possible confounders, we adjusted for BMI, smoking status, education level, research centre and menopausal status.  Finally, using the propensity score matching (greedy approach), we also matched cases and controls on both age and BMI and repeated all the analyses to examine the effect of BMI on the cardiometabolic profile of women with PCOS.     3  RESULTS   3.1  General and cardiometabolic characteristics  In this cross\u2010sectional study, we compared 200 women diagnosed with PCOS with 200 age\u2010matched controls from the general population. The baseline characteristics of the total study population are presented in Table 1 . The mean age was similar in women with PCOS (50.5\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.5) and controls (51.0\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.2). Women with PCOS had experienced menarche at a later age (13.7, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.6 vs 12.8, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.6 [ P <\u00a0.001]) and had more often experienced cycle irregularities in the past (69.8% vs 12.5% [ P <\u00a0.001]). Compared to women with PCOS, a much larger proportion of the control population was already postmenopausal (40.5% vs 12.6% [ P <\u00a0.001]). Women with PCOS were less often smokers (41.5% vs 64.8% [ P <\u00a0.001]) and had more often attended higher general education or university ( P <\u00a0.001). The free androgen index was significantly higher in women with PCOS (1.9 IQR 1.2\u20102.9 vs 1.2, IQR 0.8\u20101.7 [ P <\u00a0.001]), as well as serum levels of E 2 ( P =\u00a0.028), whereas SHBG levels were significantly lower ( P <\u00a0.001).

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd    We observed a higher BMI (28.4, IQR 23.8\u201032.9 vs 26.3, IQR 23.7\u201029.8 [ P =\u00a0.015]), higher SBP (130.0, IQR 120.0\u2010140.0 vs 122.0, IQR 112.0\u2010136.0 [ P =\u00a0.003]) and increased waist circumference (93.0, IQR 84.5\u2010107.0 vs 85.9, IQR 79.5\u201094.6 [ P <\u00a0.001]) in women with PCOS. Moreover, the prevalence of hypertension (48.2% vs 26.5% [ P <\u00a0.001]) was increased and we observed higher glucose levels (5.3, IQR 5.0\u20105.7 vs 5.1, IQR 4.8\u20105.5 [ P =\u00a0.019]). No differences were found in serum lipid levels, NT\u2010pro\u2010BNP and vitamin D levels, prevalence of cardiovascular disease or type II diabetes. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was higher in women with PCOS, but this result did not reach statistical significance. The HOMA assessment of insulin resistance yielded similar results ( P =\u00a0.647). When we repeated the analyses in an age and BMI matched control population of 171 women, the analyses yielded similar results (data not shown).    3.2  Carotid intima\u2010media thickness  We observed a lower mean cIMT (um) in women diagnosed with PCOS compared to age\u2010matched controls (612.8, SD\u00a0=\u00a093.6 vs 721.7, SD\u00a0=\u00a0118.4 [ P <\u00a0.001]). The latter was consistent across all participating university hospitals (Table S1 ). In a linear regression model after adjusting for BMI, smoking, SBP, education, measurement centre and menopausal status, we found that PCOS was associated with a lower cIMT \u03b2 (95%CI) \u22120.212 (\u22120.283\u20100.142, P <\u00a0.001).    3.3  Ten\u2010year cardiovascular disease risk and the cardiovascular health score  The median 10\u2010year CVD risk was 5.79% in women with PCOS and 7.38% in controls ( P =\u00a0.214). Next, we categorized women into low (<10%), intermediate (10%\u201020%) and high (>20%) risk for a cardiovascular event in the subsequent 10\u00a0years. We observed no significant differences in the proportion of women with PCOS and controls in each risk category ( P =\u00a0.388, Figure 1 ).

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome        4  DISCUSSION  In this large cross\u2010sectional study in women with PCOS around the age of 50, we observed that women with PCOS exhibit only a moderately unfavourable cardiometabolic profile compared to age\u2010matched controls, despite a higher BMI and larger waist circumference. The prevalence of major risk factors for CVD or CVD itself was not increased, and we found no evidence for more severe atherosclerosis in women suffering from PCOS. Finally, the aggregated measure of 10\u2010year CVD risk and overall performance on cardiovascular health metrics in women with PCOS were similar to age\u2010matched controls from the general population.  PCOS is associated with cardiometabolic disturbances, which can persist throughout life. 5 , 11 Indeed, we observed that compared with age\u2010matched controls, waist circumference, BMI, SBP and androgen levels were all significantly higher and the prevalence of hypertension was nearly 50%. At the same time, we observed no differences in lipid levels of women with PCOS and age\u2010matched controls. In addition, neither HOMA\u2010assessed insulin resistance, nor the prevalence of type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome or CVD was significantly increased at the age of 50, despite of a higher BMI and blood pressure in women with PCOS. Atherosclerosis can be detected with cIMT and used as a predictor for future CVD. In the current study, we measured a lower cIMT in women with PCOS. Variability in measuring techniques and devices may have influenced our results, baring reason for caution. However, this finding indicates that atherosclerosis is not more advanced in women with PCOS. 17 , 31 In line with this, both the estimated Framingham 10\u2010year CVD risk and the cardiovascular health score, used to predict longevity and healthy ageing, were similar in women with PCOS and age\u2010matched controls. Of note, repeating all analyses with an age\u2010BMI matched control population yielded similar results, suggesting the outcomes of our study were not driven by the higher BMI in women with PCOS.  Previous studies report an increase of CVD risk factors in women with PCOS, such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This risk is increased by the presence of PCOS per se, but also strongly correlated with BMI as overweight and obese women with PCOS are most at risk. 6 , 16 , 32 , 33 The relatively low BMI in our PCOS cohort could explain the seemingly contradictory results in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. 32 , 33 However, it also seems as if some metabolic disturbances associated with PCOS are detectable at any age, whilst others seem to disappear over time. 2 , 5 , 6 , 34 Evidence suggests that of the lipid disturbances associated with PCOS, increased triglyceride levels are the only lipid abnormality still detectable at older age. 5 , 6 , 11 , 13 The same pattern seems to apply to the metabolic syndrome, which has been described to be five times as prevalent in young women with PCOS, but to remain only two times as prevalent after the age of 39. 5 , 13 Another possible explanation for this could also be that these women were already diagnosed early on during their reproductive years and were also informed about their long\u2010term health risks, which they might have adjusted accordingly in the years following initial diagnosis.  Conflicting results have been reported on cIMT and CVD in women with PCOS. 3 , 18 , 35 Data on cIMT in middle\u2010aged and older women with (features of) PCOS are scarce, but most evidence suggests a higher cIMT. 3 , 11 , 36 The lower cIMT in women with PCOS compared to age\u2010matched controls in our study could be explained by the small proportion of women with PCOS who were postmenopausal at the age of 50. The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in cIMT. 31 The fact that on average, women with PCOS enter menopause at a later age could have a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis and risk for future CVD. 37 , 38 Indeed, most evidence points into the direction that the risk for CVD in women with PCOS is not increased. A recent large Danish study in women with PCOS, however, demonstrated higher incidence rates of CVD already an early age. 14 In this study, hypertension and dyslipidemia were considered cardiovascular diseases and comprised the majority of CVD diagnosis. The event rate for stroke was not increased and the event rate for ischaemic heart disease in women with PCOS was slightly increased but included milder forms of ischaemic heart disease (angina) in the definition. 14 Similarly, in the current study we detected a much higher prevalence of hypertension in women with PCOS, but the prevalence of cardiovascular events was similar to the general population and NT\u2010proBNP as a marker for heart failure was not increased. We believe most evidence still points into the direction that long\u2010term risk for CVD events (stroke, myocardial infarction and/or coronary heart disease) in women with PCOS might not be increased. 6 , 11 , 13   How is it possible that so many known risk factors for CVD cluster in women with PCOS already at an early age, yet this does this not seem to translate into an increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life? It might be that there is an early worsening in risk factors for CVD in women with PCOS, which does not seem to progress much over the years. 5 , 6 Again the latter might be due to the fact that women are aware of these risk factors and do anticipate accordingly to them. This in contrast to controls who seem to develop metabolic abnormalities gradually over time and apparently end at a similar level as women with PCOS. Furthermore, genetic studies have provided us with clues suggesting women with PCOS might be able to compensate the damage caused by this unfavourable accumulation of risk factors. Genetic variants associated with late menopause and associated with better DNA repair and maintenance are more prevalent in women with PCOS. These variants are correlated with long\u2010term health and longevity, suggesting a potential evolutionary advantage for women with PCOS. 39 , 40 Indeed, in our study the majority of middle\u2010aged women with PCOS were not yet postmenopausal at the age of 50. Finally, hyperandrogenism is present in the majority of women with PCOS and associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities at a younger age. In the past, hyperandrogenism was suggested as a main driver for the CVD risk in PCOS. 2 , 34 The effects of hyperandrogenism after menopause are still heavily debated. Whilst some consider hyperandrogenism to be a risk factor for CVD, other studies have shown that hyperandrogenism is not associated with a higher risk for CVD and could even be protective against CVD. 9 , 11 , 13 , 41   All of these proposed mechanisms could protect women with PCOS from developing CVD. Despite of their unfavourable profile at a younger age, long\u2010term cardiovascular health in women with PCOS seems to be similar to that of the general population. Based on the selective enrichment with better DNA repair and maintenance genes, one could hypothesize that these women should actually be healthier compared to the general population provided that they had received proper preventive treatment in combination with a healthy lifestyle from an early age on.  This is one of the largest clinical studies assessing the cardiometabolic profile and prevalence of CVD in women diagnosed with PCOS around the age of 50. Besides availability of several subclinical measures of atherosclerosis, detailed information on study subjects made it possible to comprehensively address the cardiometabolic profile of these women and to estimate their risk for future CVD. The limitations of our study also merit consideration. Our data set is quite precise and complete; unfortunately, we were still sometimes faced with missing data. Although this was only the case for a small proportion of the data, this may have led to an underestimation of the true prevalence of for instance the metabolic syndrome, as we were not able to assess all parameters in all patients. In addition, although our study population comprised a large population of meticulously phenotyped women with PCOS, we might still have lacked sufficient power to detect small associations. Our findings therefore still need to be validated in a large cohort of women with PCOS followed up until old age.  Studies following women with PCOS until very old age will eventually provide definitive answers on the risk for CVD and the involved mechanisms. Therefore, cardiovascular assessment and follow\u2010up of women with PCOS are still necessary. At this time, however, we conclude that although some metabolic disturbances were present in our large cohort of middle\u2010aged women with PCOS, we found no evidence for premature atherosclerosis or an increased risk for future CVD. Only, time will tell whether this will indeed translate into a better cardiovascular health in women with PCOS than was previously anticipated.
