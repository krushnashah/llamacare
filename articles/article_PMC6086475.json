    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex gynecological endocrine disorder that affects approximately 6% to 10% of women of their reproductive age. [ 1 , 2 ] PCOS is characterized by oligoanovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenismhyper and insulinemia, menstrual irregularity, and consequent subfertility. [ 3 ] PCOS is also associated with dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, hirsutism, insulin resistance, and an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. [ 4 \u2013 6 ] Recent studies reported that 15% to 55% of the PCOS patients were diagnosed as having nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, 32.7% to 44.6% of patients with PCOS suffer from metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome occurs with high prevalence in PCOS patients complicated with NAFLD. [ 7 , 8 ] The exact etiological mechanism of PCOS is still under debate; however, there is evidence that genetic factors play a vital role. [ 9 , 10 ]  Interleukin 6 (IL-6), an important proinflammatory and immunomodulatory pleiotropic cytokine, plays an important role in reproductive physiology. IL-6 is involved in various human diseases and pathophysiological processes, such as the development of atherosclerosis, ovarian steroid production, fertilization and implantation, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, and allergic reactions. [ 11 \u2013 15 ] The IL-6 gene is located at chromosome 7p21\u201324 locus with a 303\u200abp promoter. [ 16 ] A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which results in variation of G>C \u2212174 in the promoter region of IL-6 , has been proven to alter the gene's transcription rate. [ 17 ] Studies involving the relationship between IL\u20136 \u2013174\u200aG/C and PCOS susceptibility have been performed. [ 18 \u2013 26 ] However, the results remain inconclusive and controversial, probably because of the varied populations and limited sample sizes. Therefore, we employed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between IL\u20136 \u2013 174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) and PCOS susceptibility.    2  Materials and methods   2.1  Search strategy  The meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. [ 27 ] A comprehensive strategy was carried out to search for potential publications concerning the association between IL - 6 \u2013 174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) and PCOS susceptibility in the following databases: Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to December 1, 2017. The search terms included \u201cinterleukin-6,\u201d OR \u201cIL-6,\u201d OR \u201cIL6,\u201d AND \u201cPolycystic ovary syndrome,\u201d OR \u201cPCOS,\u201d AND\u201cpolymorphism,\u201d OR \u201cmutations,\u201d OR \u201csingle nucleotide polymorphism,\u201d OR \u201cSNP,\u201d OR \u201cvariant,\u201d OR \u201cgenotype,\u201d OR \u201cAlleles,\u201d without any limitation imposed. Publications listed in the references were also hand-searched carefully to obtain potentially relevant articles. Disagreements concerning the inclusion of a particular study were resolved by consensus. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Hangzhou Women's Hospital.    2.2  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Studies were included if they met all the following criteria: research designed as a case-control study with healthy populations as controls and patients with PCOS cases; studies assessing the relationship between the IL - 6 \u2013 174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) polymorphism and PCOS susceptibility; availability of data regarding the total number of cases and controls, number of cases and controls with G/G, G/C, and C/C genotypes; and at least 2 comparison groups (cancer group and control group). Studies were excluded if: the studies had no control group, or were case reports, review articles, or comments; the studies did not disclose the raw data regarding the IL - 6 \u2013 174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) polymorphism; and animal studies.    2.3  Data extraction  Two experienced investigators independently extracted the data according to a preset data extraction form. The following information was extracted: first author's surname; country in which the study was performed; publication year; nation or ethnicity; genotyping method; total number in the case and control groups, as well as the number of cases and controls with G/G, G/C, and C/C genotypes; and the P value used to calculate the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).    2.4  Quality assessment  Two authors independently performed a quality assessment of each study based on the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), [ 28 ] which is a widely used rating system to assessing the quality of observational studies in a meta-analysis. The NOS involves 3 broad aspects: case and control selection, comparability, and exposure. Each aspect consists of 4, 2, and 3 items respectively. This scale contains 9 items and each item scores a value of 1. An NOS score of 6 stars or above would indicate a high-quality study.    2.5  Statistical analysis  The association strength between IL - 6 \u2013 174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) polymorphism and PCOS susceptibility was assessed by calculating the pooled odds ratio (OR) along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled ORs were measured using the Z test. The HWE for each SNP was tested using the \u03c7 2 test. The ORs were combined using either the random-effects model or the fixed-effects model, as previously described. [ 29 , 30 ] A P value <.05 was regarded as a statistically significant difference. Heterogeneity across the studies was determined using the Q test and the I 2 statistical tests, with I 2 <\u200a50% indicating little difference. To explore the influence of a single study on the overall results, sensitivity analysis was also performed to test the stability of the results under all genetic models. We used Begg funnel plot test to assess possible publication bias, with P <\u200a.05 being considered to present statistical significance. All statistical analyses were conducted with STATA 11.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).     3  Results   3.1  Characteristics of the included studies  The initial search of electronic databases yielded 47 references. The flow chart of the study selection process is shown in Figure 1 . Finally, 6 original articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The detailed characteristics of the 6 included studies are shown in Table 1 . [ 21 \u2013 26 ] Four studies were performed in Turkey, [ 21 \u2013 23 , 25 ] one in Austria, [ 26 ] and another in India. [ 24 ] The frequencies of each genotype and allele, with their HWE values, are presented in Table 2 . The analyzed SNP was within the HWE in 3 studies, [ 23 , 25 , 26 ] whereas in the other 3 studies, the polymorphism was not consistent with the HWE. [ 21 , 22 , 24 ] The NOS results indicated that the studies had scores ranging from 6 to 8, with an average of 6.33, which indicated that the methodological quality of the 6 selected studies was generally reliable (Table 1 ).

Table 2   Polymorphisms genotype distribution and allele frequency in cases and controls.       3.2  Meta-analysis results  The 6 studies involved a total of 512 patients with PCOS and 606 controls. Overall, there was a decreased association between rs1800795 and PCOS susceptibility in the overall population under the allelic model (G vs. C, OR\u200a=\u200a0.59, 95% CI: 0.41\u20130.85, P =\u200a.005), the homozygous model (GG vs. CC, OR\u200a=\u200a0.45, 95% CI: 0.28\u20130.73, P =\u200a.001), the heterozygous model (GG vs. CG, OR\u200a=\u200a0.50, 95% CI: 0.26\u20130.95, P =\u200a.036), and the dominant model (GC\u200a+\u200aCC vs. GG, OR\u200a=\u200a0.48, 95% CI: 0.26\u20130.89, P =\u200a.020). However, a threshold P value of .05 was found under the recessive model (CC vs. GG\u200a+\u200aCG, OR\u200a=\u200a0.62, 95% CI: 0.39\u20131.00). The main results of the meta-analysis were listed in Table 3 . The forest plot of the pooled ORs of the association of rs1800795 with PCOS susceptibility under the homozygous model is shown in Figure 2 .

The results of subgroup analysis of the association of rs1800795 and PCOS susceptibility under the 5 models are shown in Table 4 . However, some findings should be interpreted with caution because of the limited studies in certain subgroup.

The pooled ORs and 95% CIs showed no materially differences, indicating that the pooled results of the meta-analysis were robust and reliable. Sensitivity analysis of the association between rs1800795 and PCOS susceptibility under the recessive model is shown Figure 3 .

No obvious publication bias was found for the association between rs1800795 and PCOS susceptibility under any models. Publication bias under the dominant model suggested that the result is statistically robust ( P =\u200a.531, Fig. 4 ).

Cytokine genes polymorphisms may play an important role in the etiology of PCOS. [ 25 ] As a common multifunctional cytokines, IL-6 , has been proven to influence the processes of fertilization, implantation, and ovulation, which are also affected in women with PCOS. [ 31 ] Many genetic studies have been performed to investigate the associations between IL\u22126 rs1800795 polymorphism and PCOS risk; however, the results were inconclusive. [ 21 \u2013 26 ]  A single study lacks sufficient statistical power to confirm the relationship between rs1800795 and the risk of PCOS because of the small sample size. To explore the uncertain association between these 2 entities, we performed a meta-analysis in a large sample size (512 patients with PCOS and 606 controls) to verify the associations between PCOS susceptibility and the IL - 6 \u2212174\u200aG/C (rs1800795) functional polymorphism. The results demonstrated that IL - 6 rs1800795 was associated with a decreased risk of PCOS among all populations studied. The results suggested that the IL - 6 rs1800795 polymorphism is a protective factor for PCOS susceptibility.  A previous meta-analysis with only 4 studies, containing 351 cases and 464control participants, failed to confirm an association between these 2 entities because of the small sample size. [ 20 ] In addition, they failed to show a correlation between IL - 6 rs1800795 polymorphism and PCOS susceptibility in subgroup analysis among the studies that conformed to the HWE under the allele model, recessive model, and dominant model. However, in our study, we found a statistically significant correlation among studies that conformed to the HWE under the allele model and dominant model. Another meta-analysis found positive associations between the IL - 6 rs1800795 polymorphisms and the risk of PCOS under the allelic model, homozygous model, heterozygous model, and dominant model; however, the results were inaccurate because some original data were wrong when they were extracted from the included studies. [ 19 ] For example, the number of G/C genotypes in healthy women was 35, whereas in the study mentioned above, the corresponding number was 25. [ 19 ] The number of C/C genotypes in patients with PCOS was 56, whereas in the study mentioned above, the number was 36. [ 19 ] We believed that these mistakes made the results unreliable. Considering the relative small sample size, no definite consensus could be reached. The objective of the present study was to present accurate evidence for the association between IL\u22126 rs1800795 polymorphisms and PCOS risk. The results suggested that IL - 6 polymorphism rs1800795 likely has a protective effect against PCOS, even though the P value under the recessive model was marginal. One possible reason for this association is that the C allele results in the reduction of IL - 6 production, which helps to normalize ovarian function. [ 18 ]  However, some limitations should be considered in interpreting the results. First, only 6 studies were included in our meta-analysis, which limited further analyses because certain original data were unavailable. Second, because of the limited studies in certain subgroups, some conclusions should be interpreted with caution in the subgroup analysis. In addition, we were unable to adjust for potential confounding effects such as environmental factors, lifestyle, sex, medication consumption, and other exposure factors because of the limited data. Third, 3 studies did not conform to the HWE, even though the combined ORs were not materially affected in the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, Begg funnel plot showed no potential publication bias; however, 3 of the 6 studies are outliers. Deviation from an asymmetric distribution of the funnel plot can still indicate publication bias. We failed to verify the results at the level of molecular mechanism. Data from large sample size multicenter epidemiological studies are still needed to clarify the associations.    5  Conclusion  In summary, our meta-analysis based on 6 case-control studies concluded that IL - 6  \u2212 174G/C (rs1800795) polymorphism was associated with PCOS susceptibility. The rs1800795 polymorphism is a protective factor for PCOS susceptibility. Given the limited number of ethnic groups and sample size, more evidence from larger epidemiological studies is needed to validate these results.
