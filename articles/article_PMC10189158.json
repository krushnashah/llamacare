In this experimental study, forty adult female Wistar rats (weighing 250 \u00b1 10 g) were divided\nrandomly into five groups; G1: control, G2: PCOS group, G3: PCOS+clove (30 mg/kg/ orally/daily) group, G4:\nPCOS+clove (60 mg/kg/orally/daily) group, and G5: PCOS+gonadectomy group. The PCOS was induced by a single\ndose injection of estradiol valerate (16 mg/kg/IM). Following PCOS induction, the rats were treated for 14 days. Histological\nparameters, follicle apoptosis, mRNA expression of autophagy markers (Lc3, Beclin1), oxidative stress markers,\ninsulin and blood glucose levels, as well as serum levels of aromatase and testosterone were evaluated in these rats.\nFinally, the ratio of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels was also calculated. The autophagy markers (Lc3, Beclin1), histological parameters, oxidative stress, insulin, and hormone levels\nchanged significantly in the PCOS rats (G2). In G3 and G5 groups, it was observed that the levels of LH/FSH and testosterone\ndecreased significantly in comparison to the PCOS group, and inhibition of autophagy was also observed in\nthese groups. Treatment with cloves in the G3 group significantly improved oxidative stress, histological parameters,\nand insulin levels. These findings demonstrated that oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excessive autophagy could be improved\nby treatment with low doses of clove and gonadectomy. Cloves may help to improve these parameters by regulating and\ninhibiting excessive autophagy. However, discovering the direct role of this extract in regulating the parameters such\nas oxidative stress, insulin, and androgens requires further investigation.

    "body": "Introduction  One of the prevalently complex endocrinopathy disorders\nis \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d (PCOS), affecting up to\n17.8% of women of reproductive age. The etiology of\nthis syndrome is still unclear, although environmental,\ngenetic, and hormonal factors may be necessary for its\ndevelopment ( 1 , 2 ). PCOS has been associated with\nnumerous reproductive, metabolic, and biochemical\nabnormalities such as elevated androgens, oxidative\nstress, insulin resistance disruption of the hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal axis (the ratio of luteinizing hormone\n(LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) \u2265 1) ( 3 , 4 ),\nand finally, dysregulation of ovarian steroidogenesis,\nfolliculogenesis ( 5 ). In PCOS, the PI3K/AKT/MTORE\nsignaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the\ninteractions among androgens, insulin, and growth factors.\nAutophagy, which is induced by oxidative stress ( 6 ), is\none of the main pathways of destruction and is essential for cellular homeostasis, as well as maintaining energy\nproduction and synthesis of new macromolecules. This\nprocess is vital for separating natural components from\ninefficient and unnecessary substances. Additionally, the\nprotective function of this process has been proven during\nproliferation, differentiation and regulation of reproduction\n( 7 , 8 ). Although the autophagy process typically occurs in\nthe ovary and is essential for folliculogenesis, this process\nhas a detrimental effect on the ovary through prolonged\nactivation ( 5 ). The importance of autophagy in PCOSrelated disorders is well known, including dysregulation\nof androgen, gonadotropins, insulin levels, and most\nimportantly, increased follicular atresia, which leads to\ndecreased ovarian reserve ( 9 ). Due to the role of autophagy\nin metabolic disorders of PCOS, the use of antioxidant\ninhibitors of autophagy is a reasonable treatment ( 10 ).  The Syzygium aromaticum , generally known as clove, is originally from the\nAsiatic region. Clove essential oil (eugenol, phenols, flavonoids, oleanolic acid, and\ntannins) has been shown to minimize damage caused by toxicity or oxidative stress in the\nbrain, liver, heart, kidneys, and testicles ( 11 , 12 ). Clove oil is a useful and valuable\nherb with anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic properties, and is\neffective in treating sexual disorders ( 12 ). Furthermore, it inhibits autophagy as an\nantiviral therapy ( 12 , 13 ). Since the typical clinical symptoms of this syndrome are\nassociated with autophagy disorder, in this study, clove extract was used as an autophagy\nregulator to improve PCOS rat model parameters, including apoptosis, oxidative stress, and\nand the levels of androgen, gonadotropins, aromatase, and insulin. Accordingly, the present\nstudy was conducted with the aim of investigating the potential ability of clove extract in\nregulating parameters related to autophagy in PCOS rats.    Materials and Methods  The current experimental study used 40 adult female\nWistar rats (weighing 250 \u00b1 10 g). All animals were\npurchased from Razi Institute in Mashhad, and then\nthey were intently maintained in an animal facility under\nstandard conditions (12/12 hours light/dark cycles, 23\n\u00b1 2\u00b0C, and 60-70% humidity). Rats in all groups had\nfree access to food and water. We considered ethical\nconsiderations according to the regulations of the\n\"Gonabad University of Medical Science\". The Ethical\nCode of the present research was specified as IR.GMU.\nREC.1394.32.  We randomly divided the rats into 5 experimental\ngroups: (30 mg/kg/orally/daily)  G1) Control group, that received normal saline only\n(daily oral) (n=8).  G2) PCOS group, that received a single dose injection\nof estradiol valerate for PCOS induction only with no\nother treatments (n=8).  G3) PCOS+clove (30 mg/kg) group, PCOS rats that\nreceived 30 mg/kg of clove extract daily by oral gavage\n(n=8).  G4) PCOS+clove (60 mg/kg) group, PCOS rats that\nreceived 60 mg/kg of clove extract daily by oral gavage\n(n=8).  G5) PCOS+gonadectomy group, PCOS rats that\nunderwent gonadectomy (n=8).   Experimental protocol  In the experimental process, the vaginal smear was\nexamined daily and confirmed that all rats had regular\ncycles (about 8-10 days). The PCOS was induced by an\nintramuscular injection of a single dose ( 1 ) of estradiol\nvalerate (16 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.2 ml of sesame oil\n(Riedeldehaen, Germany) ( 14 ). After confirming the\ninduction of ovarian cysts (by evaluation with estrous\ncycle without ovulation), clove oil was administered\norally for 14 days (30-60 mg) in G3 and G4 groups ( 15 ).\nClove oil contains 13 identified compounds, among which\neugenol 76.8% is considered as the main component.\nOther components incluse beta caryophyllene17.4%,\nalpha humulene 1.1%, and eugenol acetate 1.1%, which\nuse gas chromatography-spectrum mass measurement.\nFinally, at the end of treatment on day 14, the rats were\nanesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine\n(10 mg/kg). Blood samples (1 cc) were taken from the\ncardiac apex and transferred into sterile test tubes for\nbiochemical assessment (measure the serum levels of\nLH, FSH, testosterone, aromatase, insulin, and oxidative\nstress marker). The samples were centrifuged at 3000\nrpm for 15 minutes at room temperature to separate the\nserum ( 16 ). Then, the separated sera without red blood\ncells were kept at -80\u00b0C until testing ( 17 ). In addition, all\ngroups except for G5 were operated on for ovariectomy\nto examine both ovaries. Ovariectomy was performed as\nfollows: initially, the animals were anesthetized, and a\nlongitudinal incision was created in the midline behind\nthe animals. Two cm incision was made below the last\nrib. Then, Fallopian tubes with ovaries were pulled out.\nThe ovaries were removed, and the fallopian tubes were\nreturned to the abdominal cavity. Finally, the incision site\nwas sutured ( 3 , 13 ). On the fourteenth day (the end of\nthe treatment period), the rats deeply anesthetized using\nketamine-xylazine and then underwent ovariectomy. The\novaries on one side were fixed in formalin for histological\nstudies, and the other was used for molecular studies.    Vaginal smear  The PCOS model evaluation with an ovulatory estrous\ncycle was confirmed by examination of vaginal smears.\nVaginal smears of all the rats were inspected daily at the\nsame time to estimate the stage of the 4-day ovarian cycle.\nAccordingly, at first, a cotton swab was moistened and\nafter placing it in the animal's vagina, the swab was rotated\non the vaginal wall. The swab was carefully removed from\nthe vagina and the sample on the swab was spread on a\nmicroscope slide. After fixing the sample with alcohol, the prepared smear was stained with hematoxylin-eosin\n(H&E).  The observation of the slides by an optical microscope\n(Olympus BX51, Japan) with a magnification of 400\u00d7\nshows the different stages of the estrous cycle as follows:  \u2022 Proestrus: the presence of a large number of epithelial\ncells with round and large nuclei.  \u2022 Estrus: the presence of cornified epithelial cells\nwithout nuclei.  \u2022 Metestrus: the presence of both types of epithelial\ncells, nucleated and non-nucleated, along with a small\nnumber of leukocytes.  \u2022 Diestrus: the presence of leukocytes along with a\nsmall number of non-nucleated epithelial cells.  Observing a pause in the estrous cycle for two weeks\n(at least three periods) indicates the induction of PCOS\n( 18 , 19 ).    Histological evaluation  At the end of the experimental period, the rats were\nanesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and then\nsacrificed. The sample collection method was that after\nopening the abdominal wall, the ovaries were carefully\nseparated from the fallopian tube and then kept in 10%\nformalin for 48 hours. After ensuring the stabilization of\nthe ovaries, the process of dehydration and clarification\nwas done by alcohol and xylene, respectively. After\nembedding in paraffin, the ovaries were cut into 5 \u03bcmthick in coronal serial sections at 50-60 \u03bcm intervals using\na microtome. Ten sections were prepared from each ovary.\nThen, the samples are spread on the slide to be prepared\nfor H&E staining and to identify the types of follicles in\nthe ovary. The follicles were counted according to the\nfollowing definitions:  Primordial follicle: A single layer of squamous follicular\ncells surrounding the oocytes.  Primary follicle: One or more layers of follicular cells\nthat have become cubic.  Secondary follicle: This is characterized by a single,\nsizeable antral cavity.  Atretic follicles: The granulosa cells undergo apoptosis,\nand consequently, the oocyte degenerates ( 19 ).  Finally, the number of primordial, primary, antral,\natretic, and cystic follicles and corpus luteum were counted\nby an optical microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan) with a\nmagnification of 400\u00d7.    Apoptotic cell evaluation  In the sections prepared from the ovarian tissues,\napoptotic cells were identified by the TUNEL technique.\nTo perform this technique, first, serial sections of the\nsample with a thickness of 5 micrometers were obtained.\nThe sample sections were placed on a slide, and then\ndeparaffinization and hydration were done with xylene\nand decreasing concentrations of ethanol, respectively. In\nthe next step, the slides were washed twice in PBS for ten\nminutes each time. After that, the slides were exposed to\nprotein kinase for 20 minutes. After washing the slides\nagain, the TUNEL reaction was performed according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche, Germany). At the end\nof the experiment, the slides were incubated with DAB for\nten minutes. Next, they were exposed to hematoxylin dye\nfor 30 seconds to create a background color. In this staining\ntechnique, dark brown color indicates apoptotic cells\n( 20 ). For calculatingthe apoptotic index (AI) in each type\nof follicles, we counted the number of TUNEL-positive\ncells, then divided that number by the total number of\ngranulosa cells and expressed the results in percentages.\nThen the mean AI of each case was calculated ( 21 ).    Malondialdehyde level evaluation  The serum level of malondialdehyde was calculated\nby transferring 0.20 cm\u00b3 of each serum sample into a\nseparate microtube that contained 3.0 cm\u00b3 of glacial\nacetic acid, followed by addition of 1% thiobarbituric\nacid (TBA) in 2% NaOH to the tube. It was then placed\ninto the boiling water bath for 15 minutes. After cooling\nthe vial in cold water to room temperature, the absorbance\nof the pink-colored product was read at 532 nm. From\nthe standard solution obtained from malondialdehyde\ntetrabutylammonium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany),\ndifferent concentrations were prepared. A calibration\ncurve was made using different concentrations of the\nstandard solution ( 22 ).    Superoxide dimutase and glutathione peroxidase level\nevaluation  The levels of superoxide dimutase and glutathione\nperoxidase in serum were evaluated by an ELISA Reader\n(Model: ABER-2, China) - AccuBioTech) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Randox, and Ransod, UK).\nGPX level measurement is based on the Paglia-Valentine\nmethod. GPX catalyzes the oxidation of glutathione\n(GSH) by cumene hydroperoxide. The SOD level assay\nuses xanthine and xanthine oxidase (XOD) to generate\nsuperoxide radicals that react with 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-\nnitrophenol)-5-phenyltetrazoliumchloride (I.N.T) to form\na red formazan dye ( 23 ).    Evaluation of testosterone, aromatase, and the ratio\nof luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone\nlevels  Testosterone serum levels were measured according\nto the protocol of ELISA kits (Demeditec Diagnostics,\nGermany). Likewise, the serum levels of aromatase, FSH,\nand LH were also evaluated according to the ELISA kit\nprotocol (ZelBio, Italy) ( 3 ).    Blood glucose and insulin level evaluation  At the end of the treatment period, the levels of serum\nblood sugar were measured by using a glucometer (Bayer Corporation, USA). Serum insulin concentration\nwas measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nand it was determined using ELISA kits (Antibody and\nImmunoassay Services, HKU). The level of serum insulin\nand blood sugar were expressed as mIU/ml and mg/dl,\nrespectively ( 21 ).    Real time analysis evaluation  Total RNA was extracted from the ovarian tissue of each\nrat with a RNX-plus (ParsTous, Iran) kit according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. The purity of RNA was defined\nby electrophoresis on an agarose gel. The total RNA (1\n\u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed with a cDNA synthesis kit\n(ParsTous, Iran). Reverse transcription polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) was performed with ABI PRISM\u00ae\n48-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems\nStepOne, FosterCity, USA). The glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an\nendogenous gene control. The relative gene expression\nlevels were compared with those in control, and all realtime quantitative PCR were performed in triplicates ( 24 ).\nThe primers were as follows:  Beclin1-F: CGAAAGGTGGTGGCAGAAAAC  R: ACTATATTCTCGCTGGTACTGAGC  Lc3\u03b2-F : TCAGTGAGAGCTGCCTCTGTC  R: AGCAGTGGGGATTTACACAGTG  Gapdh-F : GGTCTACATGTTCCAGTATGACTC  R: CATTTGATGTTAGCGGGATCTCG    Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20\nsoftware (IBM, USA). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was\nused to measure the normal distribution of data. All data\nwere presented in mean \u00b1 SE. The one-way ANOVA test\nfollowed by the Tukey posthoc test were used to compare\nhistopathological values. The independent t test was used\nto compare and analyze the data from the real-time PCR.\nA P\u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   Superoxide dimutase, glutathione peroxidase and\nmalondialdehyde level analysis  The serum levels of GPX and SOD decreased\nsignificantly in the PCOS group as compared to the\ncontrol group (P=0.001). In the PCOS+clove (30 and 60\nmg/kg/orally/daily) and PCOS+gonadectomy groups,\nthese levels significantly increased when compared\nwith the PCOS group (P=0.001, Fig .1 ). The level of\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) in the PCOS group was\nsignificantly higher than the control group; on the other\nhand, it was significantly lower in PCOS+clove (30 and\n60 mg/kg/ orally/daily) and PCOS+gonadectomy groups\ncompared to the PCOS group (P=0.001, Fig .1 ). No\nsignificant differences were observed in the serum levels\nof GPX, SOD, or MDA between the clove treatment and\ngonadectomy groups compared with the control group.

Analysis of hormones in serum  The serum levels of testosterone showed a significant\nenhancement in the PCOS group compared to the control\ngroup. In the PCOS+clove (30 mg/kg/orally/daily) and\nPCOS+gonadectomy groups, the testosterone levels\ndecreased significantly when compared with the PCOS\ngroup (P=0.001, Fig .2 ). In comparison with the control\ngroup, the LH/FSH levels illustrated a considerable\nincrease in the PCOS group (LH/FSH \u22651). The ratio\nof serum levels of LH to FSH in the PCOS+clove (30\nmg/kg/orally/daily) and PCOS+gonadectomy groups\nwere significantly decreased compared to the PCOS\ngroup (P=0.01, LH/FSH <1). Interestingly, there was no\nsignificant difference in the serum levels of testosterone\nand the ratio of the serum levels of LH to FSH in when\ncomparing PCOS+clove (60 mg/kg/orally/daily) and\nPCOS groups ( Fig .2 ).    Insulin level analysis  The insulin level improved remarkably in the PCOS\ngroup compared to the control group. In the PCOS+clove\n(30 mg/kg/orally/daily) and PCOS+gonadectomy groups,\nit significantly decreased in comparison with the PCOS\ngroup (P=0.001, Fig .3 ).

Blood glucose level analysis  The PCOS group showed a significant increase in blood\nglucose levels compared to the control group. There was a\nsignificant decrease in the blood glucose of the PCOS+clove\n(30 mg/kg/orally/daily) and PCOS+gonadectomy groups\nas compared to the PCOS group (P=0.001, Fig .3 ).    Aromatase level analysis  The aromatase levels decreased significantly in the\nPCOS group compared to the control group (P=0.001).\nBut, in the PCOS+clove (30 mg/kg/orally/daily) and\nPCOS+gonadectomy groups, it significantly increased\ncompared with the PCOS group (P=0.001). In this\nregard, there was no significant difference between the\nPCOS+clove (60 mg/kg /orally/daily) and the PCOS\ngroup ( Fig .3 ).    Apoptosis index analysis  In this study we evaluated apoptosis indicators in the\nprimary and antral follicles. The rats displayed a standard\napoptosis index in the control group. Compared with the\ncontrols, PCOS rats exhibited an increased apoptosis\nindex in both the primary and antral follicles. Clove (30\nmg/kg/ orally/daily) treatment reduced the apoptosis\nindex as compared with the PCOS group (P<0.001). In\nthis regard, we did not observe a significant difference\nbetween the PCOS+clove (60 mg/kg /orally/daily) and\nPCOS groups ( Fig .4 ).

Histological parameters analysis  Rats in the control group displayed normal ovary\nhistology. In the PCOS group the number of corpus luteum\nand all the follicles significantly decreased. However, the\nnumber of follicular cysts increased, and cell debris in the\nantrum was detected in this group. Treatment with clove\n(30 mg/kg/ orally/daily) exhibited well-developed antral\nfollicles, a standard granulosa cell layer, and minimal\ncell debris. Also, the number of follicular cysts decreased\nfollowing clove treatment. In this regard, there was no\nsignificant difference between the PCOS+clove (60 mg/kg/\norally/daily) and PCOS groups (P=0.001, Fig .4B , Table 1 ).

Discussion  In the present study, autophagy markers (Lc3\u03b2, Beclin1),\nhistological parameters, oxidative stress, insulin levels,\nand hormone levels all changed significantly in PCOS rats\nfollowing PCOS induction when compared to the control\nrats receiving only saline. Testosterone levels and the ratio\nof LH to FSH in G3 and G5 rats were significantly lower\nthan in the rats with PCOS only (G2 group). Autophagy\ninhibition was also observed in these two groups. Clove\ntreatment in the G3 group improved oxidative stress,\nhistological parameters, and insulin levels significantly.\nPCOS is an endocrinological disorder. Internationally, the\nRotterdam criterion describes PCOS as follows: i. Low or\nno ovulation, ii. Hyper-androgenic, iii. Polycystic ovaries\n( 25 ). This syndrome is associated with impaired insulin\nlevels, obesity, and diabetes in most women. In this\nsyndrome, some morphological ovarian markers such as\na few preantral follicles, antral follicles, atretic follicles,\nand degenerative ovarian cysts may be shown. Although\nthis study showed all the above markers, some studies\nhave suggested that these markers are not exclusive to\nPCOS ( 3 - 5 ).  In the present study, following the induction of PCOS\nin adult rats, parameters such as hyper-androgenemia,\nhyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, increased LH/FSH\nratio, increased aromatase level, oxidative stress, and\novarian tissue apoptosis were observed. Autophagy\nis considered as an intracellular homeostasis process.\nDuring this process, autophagy-related proteins,\nincluding Lc3 and Beclin, form a structure called the\nautophagosome, which destroys the dysfunctional and\nstressful components of the cell by attaching to the\nlysosome ( 26 ). Autophagy has been shown to regulate\nprimary follicle growth and atresia. It is a key part of\neach follicle's defense mechanism in response to various\nintracellular and extracellular stimuli ( 9 ). As mentioned\nabove, autophagy dysregulation has been reported in\nPCOS. Molecular findings of a recent study showed\nan increase in autophagy markers (LC3 and Beclin1)\nfollowing induction of PCOS ( 6 ). Other features of PCOS\ninclude increased oxidative stress, such as intracellular\nROS, which is one of the main pathways preoccupied in\nPCOS pathogenesis ( 26 - 28 ). This study showed that the\nMDA level significantly increased while the SOD and\nGPX levels significantly decreased as a result of induction\nof PCOS in rats. Other reports have shown that oxidative\nstress may lead to induction of autophagy and eventually\nfollicular atresia through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\n( 6 , 29 ). The biochemical findings of this paper show an\nincrease in androgens in rats with PCOS, which makes\nit possible to induce autophagy by hyperandrogenism.\nStudies have shown that androgens induce autophagy\nby regulating Beclin expression ( 30 ). On the other hand,\nautophagy in the PCOS ovarian theca layer has been\nshown to lead to hyperandrogenism ( 31 ). Autophagy and\nhyperandrogenism seem to have a synergistic effect.  Other biochemical results of the present study include an increased LH/FSH ratio, which\nprovides a significant value in diagnosing PCOS ( 32 ). Studies have shown that the formation\nof autophagosomes have an effect on FSH levels ( 33 , 34 ). The role of autophagy in regulating\nthe insulin associated with this syndrome is well known ( 35 , 36 ). In this study, impaired\ninsulin levels may have resulted from disruption of normal autophagic function. Due to the\nimpairment of autophagy-related parameters, by considering the above data, S.\naromaticum (Clove) has been suggested as a potent antioxidant and an autophagy\ninhibitor ( 37 ) for managing PCOS. This plant enhances antioxidant enzymes by increasing the\nlevels of MDA, SOD, and GPX in the treatment groups. We found the highest reduction in\noxidative stress in a dose of 60mg clove, but this dose could not increase aromatase and did\nnot reduce the levels of androgen and gonadotropins. In contrast, 30mg of cloves improved\ninsulin, androgen, and gonadotropin levels. In this regard, other studies have suggested the\nopposite effects of high doses over low doses of clove oil on the reproductive system ( 15 ).\nThe findings of our study also indicated an increase in apoptosis index in antral and\npreantral follicles in PCOS rats. In the study, treatment with 30 mg, unlike 60 mg clove\nextract, improved the number of follicles and reduced the apoptosis index. The results of\nthe treatment with 30 mg may be due to an improvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian\naxis and an approximate return to normal levels of gonadotropins. Since clove has an\ninhibitory effect on the expression of autophagic genes, including Beclin and Lc3, it has\nbeen reported to be effective as an anti-autophagic drug in the treatment of influenza, a\nviral infection ( 38 ).  In this study, there was a decreased autophagy activity, with\nspecial significance in the clove-treated group. This decrease\nin autophagy activity was associated with normalized\ninsulin and blood glucose levels. The present results further\nsuggest that clove may indicate a good therapeutic strategy\nin the treatment of autophagy-related PCOS parameters.\nIn addition, we found that an orally administered clove\nreduces LH/FSH levels as well as the abnormal secretion of\nandrogen levels. Since autophagy plays an important role\nin PCOS-dependent metabolism, this study was designed to\ndetermine whether the improvement of PCOS parameters\nwas the result of inhibition of autophagy by cloves. As one\ncontrol group, we used a gonadectomy group (to eliminate\nthe source of autophagy). We found that improvement in\nPCOS parameters (oxidative stress, insulin, blood glucose,\ngonadotropins, and testosterone levels) occurred after\nthe removal of the source of autophagy (ovarian tissue).\nTherefore, clove may help to improve the parameters by\nregulating autophagy and inhibiting excessive autophagy.\nHowever, the direct role of this extract in regulating the\nparameters such as oxidative stress, insulin, and androgens\ncannot be ignored ( 39 , 40 ).    Conclusion  This study suggests that gonadectomy may be an\nappropriate method for women who are not prone to\nfertility; however, pharmacological properties of lowdose clove as a metabolic regulator may be beneficial for\nwomen who are prone to fertility.",
