    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reproductive disorders and adverse cardiometabolic risk factors that can negatively impact the general health of women. Inulin\u2010type fructans (ITFs) are proposed to beneficially affect risk factors associated with metabolic disorders. Whether ITFs can help with the management of PCOS by modifying insulin resistance (IR) and androgen levels has not yet been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ITFs with different degrees of polymerization on insulin resistance, blood lipids, anthropometric measures, and hormonal status in overweight and obese women with PCOS. In a randomized double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled trial, seventy\u2010five women with PCOS aged 18\u201340\u2009years old were randomly assigned to receive 10\u2009g/day of high\u2010performance inulin (HPI) or oligofructose\u2010enriched inulin (OEI) or maltodextrin for 12\u2009weeks. Biochemical and clinical outcomes were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants in the HPI and OEI groups experienced improvements in waist circumference, total testosterone, free androgen index, sex hormone\u2010binding globulin, and triglycerides compared to the placebo group. Also, the number of women with irregular menses or oligomenorrhoea decreased significantly in both ITF groups. Participants in the HPI group reported lower body mass, fasting insulin, and HOMA\u2010IR, as well as a higher quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. ITF supplementation, especially with long\u2010chain ITFs, when given for 12\u2009weeks may improve metabolic outcomes, androgen status and clinical manifestations in women with PCOS. Supplementation with inulin\u2010type fructans for 12\u2009weeks improves weight loss, androgen status, and clinical manifestations of PCOS. The beneficial effects of high\u2010performance inulin on weight loss, insulin resistance, and hirsutism are more remarkable than those of oligofructose\u2010enriched inulin.",
    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most widespread endocrine disease in women of reproductive age, and it is believed to affect 6%\u201320% of women worldwide (Deswal et\u00a0al., 2020 ). It is defined by the presence of at least two of three classic features: ovulatory dysfunction, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (defined as 12 or more antral follicles (2\u20139\u2009mm in diameter) in either ovary, an ovarian volume that is greater than 10\u2009mL in either ovary, or both) (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ). The most reliable clinical marker of androgen excess is hirsutism, defined as a modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey score \u22658. Ovulatory dysfunction mainly presents in the form of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. More rarely, oligoovulation leads to polymenorrhea. Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with adverse cardiometabolic risk factors including insulin resistance (IR), obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which can all negatively impact the general health of women (McCartney & Marshall, 2016 ; Osibogun et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  The exact etiology of this complex disorder remains unclear; however, genetic, neuroendocrine, and nutritional factors are suggested to cause or increase the risk of PCOS (Azziz, 2018 ; Singh et\u00a0al., 2023 ). Many studies have demonstrated the interconnection between PCOS and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota (He & Li, 2020 ; Rizk & Thackray, 2021 ). Increased intestinal mucosal permeability and leakage of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into systemic circulation following gut dysbiosis lead to LPS\u2010induced endotoxemia (He & Li, 2020 ). The resulting low\u2010grade inflammation interferes with the function of insulin receptors, leading to IR and a compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which promotes androgen secretion by ovarian theca cells and interrupts normal follicular development (Sun et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  Gut bacterial composition and diversity depend on many factors, including diet and the consumption of dietary fibers and prebiotics (He & Shi, 2017 ; Peredo\u2010Lovillo et\u00a0al., 2020 ). A prebiotic is \u201ca substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring a health benefit\u201d (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Inulin\u2010type fructans (ITFs), plant\u2010stored polysaccharides consisting of \u03b2\u2010(2\u20101)\u2010linked fructose residues, are among the most studied prebiotic fibers that can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria (Nagy et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Vandeputte et\u00a0al., 2017 ). ITFs are mainly produced from chicory roots and can be separated into inulin [degree of polymerization (DP) 2\u201360], short\u2010chain fructooligosaccharides (DP 2\u20134), and oligofructose (DP <\u200910). The bifidogenic effects of ITFs have been well established, as ITFs increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. Bifidobacterium are believed to have numerous health\u2010promoting effects, including the maintenance of gut epithelial integrity and modulating immune responses (Nagy et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Evidence exists on the key role of gut microbiota in the development of IR in PCOS (He & Li, 2020 ). Inulin\u2010type fructans may improve metabolic endotoxemia, inflammation, and metabolic defects, including IR (Chambers et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Tawfick et\u00a0al., 2022 ), as well as help with the management of PCOS by modifying gut bacterial composition (Xue et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Additionally, IR may be involved in the three classical features and metabolic defects associated with PCOS (He & Li, 2020 ; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2020 ). So, targeting IR may be an effective approach in the management of PCOS. The beneficial effects of some prebiotics, such as resistant dextrin, on metabolic and hormonal status in women with PCOS have been proposed previously (Gholizadeh Shamasbi et\u00a0al., 2019 ); however, to our knowledge, there are no studies on the effect of ITFs on IR and androgen levels in these patients.  When considering ITF supplementation, it should be noted that the prebiotic effects of ITFs depend on their DP (Du et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Whether ITFs of lower DP or higher DP exert more pronounced prebiotic effects in humans is not fully understood due to inconsistent findings (Ast\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Despite having several short\u2010term and long\u2010term health consequences, PCOS remains one of the most poorly understood medical disorders among scientists, patients, and physicians. Currently, there is no specific pharmacological treatment approved for PCOS by the FDA or other health authorities. Identifying dietary interventions that help to improve PCOS symptoms and complications by affecting IR is of great importance. We hypothesized that ITFs might be an effective and safe therapeutic approach in women with PCOS via the modification of IR and excess androgens. Thus, we conducted an intervention to investigate the impact of ITF supplementation on weight loss, IR, blood lipids, and biochemical and clinical hyperandrogenism in overweight and obese women with PCOS. Additionally, this study aimed to measure if ITFs with different DPs may have different effects on these outcomes.    2  METHODS AND MATERIALS   2.1  Trial design  The present study is a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, parallel\u2010group clinical trial. The subjects were recruited from Shahid\u2010Beheshti Women's Hospital and The Gynecology Clinic at Amin Hospital, affiliated with the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Isfahan, Iran, between October 2020 and March 2021. Women with PCOS, diagnosed using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ), aged between 18 and 40\u2009years, and with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35\u2009kg/m 2 , were included in the study. Participants were provided with an information sheet explaining the protocol and the potential benefits and adverse effects of the intervention, and consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Research Council (Approval No: 399461) and Ethics Committee (IR. MUI.RESEACH. REC.1399.471) of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, and was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT, www.irct.ir ) (Ref. No: IRCT20101101005062N11).    2.2  Participants  Through purposive sampling, women with PCOS admitted to two hospitals were invited to participate. We also advertised at the hospital or clinic lobby to invite participants. PCOS was diagnosed by two experienced gynecologists (Z.SH and H.T) following the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, and patients with two of the following were considered to have PCOS: biochemical indicators (serum total testosterone >0.481\u2009ng/mL [conversion factor to SI unit (nmol/L): 3/467]) and/or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism using modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey score of \u22658), oligo\u2010ovulation and/or anovulation (menstrual cycle length less than 21\u2009days or greater than 35\u2009days), and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography (12 or more antral follicles measuring 2\u20139\u2009mm in diameter in each ovary and/or increased ovarian volume >10\u2009mL 3 , in either ovary or both) (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ). Participants were excluded if they: were younger than 18\u2009years or older than 40\u2009years; had BMI \u226425 or\u2009\u2265\u200935\u2009kg/m 2 ; were current or previous (within the last 3\u2009months) users of oral contraceptive drugs, hormone therapy, weight\u2010loss interventions, probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotic supplements, anti\u2010acid drugs, antibiotics or multivitamin mineral supplements; had a history of autoimmune diseases, any type of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, abnormal liver function test, any type of kidney disease, other endocrine disorders including thyroid disorders, diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia and androgenic disorders, functional gastrointestinal diseases (all based on patients' medical records); were allergic to ITFs or placebo; were following specific diet or physical activity programs; were current smokers; were pregnant (or planning for pregnancy within next 6\u2009months) or lactating; or had poor compliance (less than 80%) with the intervention (Armijo\u2010Olivo et\u00a0al., 2009 ).    2.3  Intervention  Participants were randomized into two intervention groups and one placebo group (1:1:1). Two ITFs with different DPs were used. High\u2010performance inulin (HPI) was used as the long\u2010chain ITF, and oligofructose\u2010enriched inulin (OEI) was used as the short\u2010chain ITF. Participants in the intervention groups were provided with 10\u2009g/day HPI (Frutafit\u00ae TEX, Sensus, Borchwerf 3, 4704 RG, Roosendaal, Netherlands, DP\u2009\u2265\u200923) ( n =\u200925) or 10\u2009g/day OEI (Frutafit\u00ae IQ, Sensus, Borchwerf 3, 4704 RG, Roosendaal, Netherlands, DP\u2009=\u20098\u201313) ( n =\u200925). Participants in the placebo group received 10\u2009g/day maltodextrin (Zarfructose Company, Tehran, Iran, Dextrose Equivalent [DE]\u2009=\u200914) ( n =\u200925). The intervention duration was 12\u2009weeks. Intervention and placebo materials were provided in similar 10\u2010g packages in powder, similar in appearance, smell, color, texture, and taste. The dose of 10\u2009g was chosen based on the literature, considering the amounts of ITFs sufficient to promote beneficial changes in the gut microbiota (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019 ) but low enough to minimize adverse gastrointestinal side effects. Participants received 45\u2009packages of intervention and placebo materials twice, at baseline and at the follow\u2010up visit (end of the sixth week). During the first 2\u2009weeks of supplementation, to facilitate gastrointestinal adaptation to the fiber and decrease side effects, participants were instructed to take half of the package (~5\u2009g) in the morning and another half at night. They were instructed to add the powder to food or drinks (water, tea, coffee, or lemon juice) and consume it before or with their meal, and return empty or unused packages to measure compliance. Participants received a weekly phone call to monitor their adherence and ask about possible adverse effects. Participants were also instructed not to make any changes in their usual diet, exercise, or medication during the intervention and to refrain from consuming any types of prebiotics, symbiotics, or probiotic supplements or foods.    2.4  Assessment of variables   2.4.1  Dietary intake and physical activity levels  Participants completed a 3\u2010day food log, including two weekdays and one weekend day, and a physical activity (PA) questionnaire at baseline and the end of the study, with the help of a trained nutritionist, to verify that they maintained their usual diet and physical activity levels during the trial. The recorded food items and drinks were converted to grams/day using standard Iranian household measures (Ghaffarpour et\u00a0al., 1999 ). Dietary intakes were then analyzed using the Nutritionist\u20104 software (First Databank Inc., San Bruno, CA), which was modified for Iranian foods. The Iranian version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to measure and report PA levels as metabolic\u2010equivalent hours per day (MET/h/day) (Moghaddam et\u00a0al., 2012 ).    2.4.2  Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements  Body weight was measured without shoes and with minimal clothing and by a digital Seca scale (Seca 831, Hamburg, Germany), to the nearest 0 \u00b7 1\u2009kg. Height was measured in a standing position without shoes by a portable stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.5\u2009cm. BMI was calculated as body mass divided by height squared (kg/m 2 ). A flexible measuring tape was utilized to measure waist circumference (WC) to the precision of 0.1\u2009cm at the midpoint between the ribs and iliac crest. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and at the end of the trial with a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer after participants were seated and rested for 10\u2009min. Blood pressure was measured twice with at least a 30\u2010s interval between measures, and the average of the two measurements was used for the analyses.     2.5  Assessment of PCOS clinical features  Each participant's hirsutism score and menstrual cycle characteristics were assessed at baseline and at the end of the trial by a trained researcher (R.Z). Menstrual cycle characteristics, including menstrual cycle length and abnormalities of the menstrual cycle, were assessed using an interview and a checklist designed for this study. Women with menses every 21\u201334\u2009days were considered to have regular menstruation; otherwise, irregular menstruation was recorded (Klein et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Secondary amenorrhea was characterized by the cessation of previously regular menses for 3\u2009months or previously irregular menses for 6\u2009months (Klein et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Oligomenorrhea was characterized as a menstrual cycle length greater than 35\u2009days, or four to nine menstrual cycles in a year (Azziz, 2018 ). For evaluating hirsutism, the modified Ferriman\u2010Gallwey (mFG) scoring system was used, and 9 body areas, including upper abdomen, lower abdomen, thighs, back, arm, upper lip, chin, chest, and buttocks, were examined for hair and scored from 0 (no visible terminal hair) to 4 (terminal hair growth with a male pattern) (Hatch et\u00a0al., 1981 ). The total scores range from 0 to 36.    2.6  Main outcomes  Markers of IR [serum fasting insulin level, Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA\u2010IR), and Quantitative Insulin\u2010Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI)], hormonal status [total testosterone, sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG), and Free Androgen Index (FAI)], as well as clinical variables [hirsutism and menstrual cycle status] were considered primary outcomes. Other variables, such as serum lipid levels, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and anthropometric indices, were considered secondary outcomes.    2.7  Randomization and blinding  The participants were randomly allocated using a stratified permuted block randomization design (with block size 3) to one of the 3 treatment groups (A, B, or C) by a random number generator ( https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple\u2010randomiser/v1/lists ) to create a blocked randomization list, in which A was the HPI group, B was the OEI group, and D was the placebo group. Participants were stratified based on age (18\u201330\u2009years and 30\u201340\u2009years) and groups (HPI, OEI, and placebo). A trained person who was not involved in the selection and randomization of the participants prepared, coded, and sealed the opaque packages. Participants, laboratory staff, and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation until the main analyses were completed.    2.8  Biochemical assessment  Fasting blood samples (10\u2009mL) were collected at baseline and the end of the trial by a trained phlebotomist and assessed at one of the reference laboratories in Isfahan. Samples were centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 2500\u2009rpm (Beckman Avanti J\u201025; Beckman 174 Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at room temperature. FPG and serum lipid concentrations were analyzed on the day of sampling, and the remaining serum was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until the assays were complete. FPG, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL\u2010 and HDL\u2010cholesterol concentrations were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric assay (Pars Azmun, Tehran, Iran). All inter\u2010 and intra\u2010assay coefficients of variability (CVs) for FPG and blood lipid measurements were less than 5%. Serum fasting insulin levels were assessed using an ELISA kit (Monobind, California, USA) with intra\u2010 and inter\u2010assay CVs of 4.8%. HOMA\u2010IR, as a measure of IR, was calculated using the following formula: HOMA\u2010IR\u2009=\u2009(fasting insulin [mIU/L]\u2009\u00d7\u2009fasting blood glucose [mg/dL])/405 (or (fasting insulin [mIU/L]\u2009\u00d7\u2009fasting blood glucose [mmol/L])/22\u2009\u00d7\u20095) (Albareda et\u00a0al., 2000 ). For assessing the degree of insulin sensitivity, the QUICKI was determined using the following formula: 1/(log fasting glucose\u2009+\u2009log fasting insulin) (Katz et\u00a0al., 2000 ). Serum total testosterone and SHBG levels were measured using a validated commercial kit (DiaMetra, Milano, Italy), with inter\u2010 and intra\u2010assay CVs of less than 7%. The free androgen index (FAI) was calculated as the percentage of total testosterone to SHBG.    2.9  Sample size  The sample size was calculated using the formula for a randomized controlled trial with a three\u2010arm parallel design. Considering the effect size reported in similar interventions (Dehghan et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Ziaei et\u00a0al., 2022 ), a standard effect size of 0.9 was estimated for the main outcomes to detect significant differences between groups. Considering g =\u20093, \u03b1 =\u20090.05, power\u2009=\u200980%, and the standard effect size \u22650.9, a total of 75 subjects was required.  n 1 = 1 + g \u2212 1 z 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2 + z 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u2206 2 + z 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2 2 g \u2212 1 2 1 + g \u2212 1 = 1 + 3 \u2212 1 7.849 0.9 2 + 1.96 2 3 \u2212 1 2 1 + 3 \u2212 1 \u2245 25    n = n 1 + g \u2212 1 n 2 = 25 + 2 * 25 = 75      2.10  Statistical methods  Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 22.0; IBM Corp.). Data were evaluated and managed for the presence of missing data and violations of normality. Q\u2013Q plots, skewness statistics, and the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test were used for assessing the normal distribution of variables. Data were reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and frequency with percentages for categorical variables. Appropriate transformation approaches were applied for variables with an abnormal distribution. One\u2010way ANOVA and Chi square analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics of study participants between groups. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the adjustment of baseline values and potential covariates, including weight change and use of insulin sensitizers, was used to compare continuous variables post\u2010intervention. Bonferroni post\u2010hoc analysis was used for two\u2010by\u2010two comparisons of the groups, where appropriate. Paired t\u2010 tests or the McNemar test (for categorical data) were used to compare outcome variables pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention. To estimate the effect of the intervention on binary variables, a logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounding variables was performed. For intent\u2010to\u2010treat analysis (ITT), missing values were imputed using the regression\u2010based multiple imputation procedure. A p \u2010value <.05 was considered statistically significant.     3  RESULTS  A total of 110 women with PCOS were screened, of whom 75 met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate. Seven patients were lost to follow\u2010up, including three in the HPI group (due to getting pregnant, n =\u20091; low compliance rate, n =\u20091; and a COVID\u201019 infection, n =\u20091), two in the OEI group (a COVID\u201019 infection, n =\u20091 and low compliance rate, n =\u20091), and two in the placebo group (personal reasons, n =\u20091 and taking medication, n =\u20091) (Figure 1 ). Sixty\u2010eight women completed the 12\u2010week intervention; however, all 75 participants were included in the ITT analyses.   FIGURE 1   Flow diagram of study recruitment.     Mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues were reported during the first 2\u2009weeks of intervention in three participants from the HPI group (12%) and one in the OEI group (4%), including mild bloating ( n =\u20092), abdominal cramps ( n =\u20091), and nausea ( n =\u20091). However, these complications were transient and improved in the following weeks.  Baseline characteristics of participants, including mean age, height, body weight, BMI, physical activity level, blood pressure, marital status, history of infertility, menstrual cycle characteristics, and use of insulin sensitizers, were similar between the HPI, OEI, and placebo groups (Table 1 ). No significant differences were observed between the three groups in baseline nutritional intakes (mean energy, macronutrients, dietary fat, total dietary fiber, and cholesterol intakes). The nutritional intakes of the women were not different before and after treatment between HPI, OEI, and placebo groups.

Also, QUICKI increased significantly by the end of the intervention in the HPI group when compared with the placebo group (MD in the HPI group: 0.01 vs. MD in the placebo group: 0.00006; p =\u2009.01). The FPG level was not found to be different between or within the three groups (Table 2 ).

Also, a significant increase in serum SHBG concentrations was observed in both the HPI and OEI groups compared to the placebo (MD in the HPI group: 9.73 vs. MD in the OEI group: 9.29 vs. MD in the placebo group: \u22121.7\u2009nmol/L; p <\u2009.001) (Table 2 ).  Regarding clinical manifestations of PCOS, the hirsutism score decreased in the HPI and OEI groups, and the changes were significant in the HPI group compared to the placebo (MD in the HPI group: \u22122.52 vs. MD in the placebo group: \u22120.5; p <\u2009.001) at the end of the trial. Based on post\u2010hoc analyses, changes in total testosterone levels and hirsutism scores were higher among the HPI group than the OEI group (MD: \u22120.21; p <\u20090.001 and MD: \u22121.08; p =\u2009.04, respectively) (Table 2 ).  As shown in Table 2 , there was not a significant difference between the three groups in terms of menstrual cycle length.  Data regarding menstrual abnormalities is shown in Table 3 . The number of women with irregular menstrual cycles ( p =\u2009.004) and oligomenorrhoea ( p =\u20090.005) decreased, and the number of women with regular menstruation ( p =\u20090.004) increased significantly in the HPI and OEI groups compared with the placebo.

Twelve weeks of supplementation with HPI and OEI induced a significant decrease in mean serum levels of triglycerides compared to the placebo (MD in the HPI group: \u221237.04 vs. MD in the OEI group: \u221228.04 vs. MD in the placebo group: \u22124.66\u2009mg/dL [conversion factor to SI units (mmol/L): 0/011]; p <\u2009.001). However, the three groups showed no difference in mean serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL\u2010C, HDL\u2010C, and the LDL\u2010C/HDL\u2010C ratio. Post\u2010intervention levels of serum triglyceride were not significantly different between the HPI and OEI groups (MD: \u22124.88; p >\u2009.05) (Table 2 ).     4  DISCUSSION  The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of inulin supplementation with different DP on anthropometric and metabolic parameters, IR, androgen status, and clinical manifestations in women with PCOS. We found that both HPI and OEI supplementations for 12\u2009weeks had beneficial effects on weight loss, serum total testosterone, FAI, serum SHBG, serum triglycerides, and clinical manifestations of PCOS, including menstrual abnormalities, but they did not significantly affect FPG and other serum lipid parameters. Also, it was concluded that the beneficial effects of HPI on body weight, BMI, fasting insulin, IR, and the hirsutism score are more remarkable than OEI.  Although obesity is not the leading cause of PCOS, it exacerbates IR as well as metabolic and reproductive disorders associated with the disease (Cena et\u00a0al., 2020 ). We found that supplementation with ITFs for 12\u2009weeks, especially those with higher DP, had favorable effects on body weight, BMI, and WC in women with PCOS. To our knowledge, this study is the only trial assessing the effects of ITFs on metabolic and hormonal measures in PCOS patients; however, inulin supplementation was associated with beneficial anti\u2010obesity effects in other target populations (Visuthranukul et\u00a0al., 2022 ). In a study by Guess et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2015 ), inulin supplementation for 18\u2009weeks promoted weight loss and reduced hepatic and soleus muscle fat content, independent of weight loss, in prediabetic subjects. Interest regarding the potential role of gut dysbiosis in the homeostasis of energy metabolism and obesity has grown dramatically in recent years. The anti\u2010obesogenic impact of ITFs may be partly attributed to SCFAs, which promote energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria of the liver and muscles via the activation of 5\u2032\u2010AMP\u2010activated protein kinase (Amabebe et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Also, SCFAs exhibit anti\u2010inflammatory properties by promoting gut barrier function, thus favorably affecting obesity (Martin\u2010Gallausiaux et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Moreover, ITFs induce satiety and reduce food intake through increased secretion of anoretic hormones such as glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101) in animal and human studies (Alptekin et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Hiel et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Insulin resistance may be involved in the three classical features and metabolic defects associated with PCOS (He & Li, 2020 ; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2020 ). So, targeting IR may be an effective approach to the management of PCOS. We found a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, following supplementation with HPI for 12\u2009weeks. The beneficial effect of inulin on IR was irrespective of obesity, as findings remained significant after further adjustments for body weight. Our findings are in agreement with several previous studies that have been conducted in the field; however, these studies were conducted among different target populations. A meta\u2010analysis by Rao et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2019 ) reported a significant reduction in IR in patients with type\u20102 diabetes melitus (T2DM) following supplementation with ITFs. Insulin resistance is interrelated with the intestinal microbiota, and gut dysbiosis is more notable in insulin\u2010resistant PCOS patients (He & Li, 2020 ). Increased intestinal permeability following an imbalance of gut microbiota causes low\u2010grade inflammation, which interferes with the function of insulin receptors (Dong et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the beneficial effects of ITFs on IR and glycemic control, such as improving gut integrity due to SCFA production (Birkeland et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2019 ), enhancing the production of peptide YY and GLP\u20101, and promoting weight loss (Catry et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Morrison & Preston, 2016 ).  The FPG level was not found to be different between or within the three groups in the present study. The findings regarding the blood glucose\u2010lowering impact of ITFs are contradictory. Several studies, mainly conducted in diabetic or prediabetic populations, have reported a significant reduction in blood glucose concentrations following inulin supplementation (Li et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020 ). However, Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2017 ), in a meta\u2010analysis of randomized controlled trials on the effect of ITFs on glycemic control, observed a reduced FPG level among the T2DM subgroup only. We did not include PCOS women who were diabetic or prediabetic in the present study. Patients with diabetes might be more responsive to the intervention due to their different intestinal bacterial composition and elevated insulin and glucose levels.  Hyperandrogenemia aggravates IR through increased formation of free fatty acids (FFAs) and decomposition of visceral adipose tissue (He & Li, 2020 ; Pateguana & Janes, 2019 ). Since hyperinsulinemia promotes androgen production, a vicious cycle promoting hyperandrogenism and IR is formed in PCOS. Inulin supplementation induced a significant reduction in serum total testosterone concentrations and the hirsutism score as the main clinical symptoms of hyperandrogenism. We considered FAI as a valid estimate of true androgen status (Blight et\u00a0al., 1989 ), and FAI decreased significantly in both HPI and OEI groups. Due to the lack of similar studies in this field, we compared our findings with those evaluating the effect of other prebiotics, synbiotics, or probiotics on hormonal status in PCOS, and we found our findings to be consistent with these (Cozzolino et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Hadi et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Shamasbi et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2020 ), in a meta\u2010analysis on the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on hormonal status in PCOS, showed a significant increase in SHBG and a significant decrease in FAI following treatment.  The number of patients experiencing irregular menses, including both polymenorrhea and oligomenorrhea, was reduced in HPI and OEI groups. Inulin supplementation did not affect the number of patients with amenorrhea, which might be due to the short duration of our study. Menstrual cycle length was not found to be different between the three groups. Prebiotics such as ITFs inhibit inflammation and attenuate hyperinsulinemia (Yurtda\u015f & Akdevelio\u011flu, 2020 ). Hyperinsulinemia leads to hyperandrogenism and disrupts normal follicular growth, as the severity of hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities is positively correlated with the degree of hyperinsulinemia (Ezeh et\u00a0al., 2022 ).  Our results regarding the triglyceride\u2010lowering effect of ITFs are in line with several animal and human studies (Hiel et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Despite the nonsignificant effects of inulin supplementation on other lipid endpoints, we observed a minimally significant improvement in the LDL\u2010C/HDL\u2010C ratio following HPI supplementation based on within\u2010group analyses. Guo et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2012 ) conducted a meta\u2010analysis to evaluate and compare the effects of ITFs on the blood lipids of normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic subjects. They found inulin to beneficially affect serum triglyceride, TC, and LDL\u2010C levels in hyperlipidemic participants but not in normolipidemic participants. Our study participants had relatively normal cholesterol values at baseline, which might partly explain our nonsignificant findings in this regard. The lipid\u2010lowering mechanisms of ITFs have not been fully elucidated. Increased fecal bile acid excretion as well as the formation of SCFAs, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis and promote weight loss, are among the proposed mechanisms in this field (Dong et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Hughes et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Qin et\u00a0al., 2023 ).  ITFs with different DPs induce different effects on the gut microbiome due to their different fermentation patterns (Ast\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Based on several animal and in\u00a0vitro studies, the modulating effects of long\u2010chain ITFs on gut microbiota, formation of SCFAs, metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation, and glucose and lipid homeostasis were more pronounced than those of short\u2010chain ITFs (Ast\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2020 ). However, a few studies reported contradictory results (Ruan et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Little information exists on the impact of fructans with different DPs on gut dysbiosis and metabolic defects in humans. Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2017 ), in a meta\u2010analysis on the effects of ITFs on blood lipids and glucose levels, conducted a subgroup analysis of the inulin (DP\u2009\u2265\u200910) and FOS (DP\u2009<\u200910) intervention trials. They found inulin, but not FOS, beneficially affects blood lipid concentrations. ITFs with higher DP induce higher alpha\u2010diversity as well as SCFA production and acidification activity, compared with those with lower DP (Ast\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Also, their fermentation takes a longer time, making their prebiotic activity in the distal part of the colon more prominent than short\u2010chain inulin.  The present study is the first to investigate the effects of ITFs on the metabolic and hormonal parameters of women with PCOS in a randomized, controlled trial with a relatively long duration. Also, in this study, we differentiate and compare the effects of fructans with different DP on various parameters in PCOS patients for the first time. However, this study had some limitations. First, gut bacterial changes, SCFA production, and gut epithelial permeability were not assessed before and after the intervention to confirm the modulating impact of ITFs on gut dysbiosis. Additionally, patient compliance is not fully known. Analyzing intestinal bacterial changes should be a point of focus in future studies. Furthermore, for some variables, including the LDL\u2010C/HDL\u2010C ratio and menstrual cycle length, a larger sample size might be required to obtain statistical significance. Moreover, since we only recruited overweight and obese women with PCOS, our findings cannot be generalized to all PCOS patients. Other limitations include not measuring body composition changes and the fact that self\u2010reported evaluations of dietary intakes were used.    5  CONCLUSION  A 12\u2010week supplementation with either HPI or OEI may improve visceral obesity, hormonal status, serum triglyceride level, and menstrual cycle irregularities in overweight and obese women with PCOS. Also, ITFs with higher DP appear to be more powerful at improving obesity measures, IR, and the hirsutism score. Overall, ITFs might be considered a novel therapeutic approach for patients with PCOS due to their modifying effects on IR and hyperandrogenemia. Further studies with larger sample sizes and fewer limitations are needed to confirm our findings. Gut bacterial changes, SCFA production, and gut epithelial permeability should be assessed in future studies to confirm the relationship between ITF supplementation and PCOS.
