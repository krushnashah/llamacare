    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects more than 1 in 10 women. As part of the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines update, comparisons between combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), metformin, and combination treatment were evaluated. Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, All EBM, and CINAHL were searched. Women with PCOS included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We calculated mean differences and 95% CIs regarding anthropometrics, metabolic, and hyperandrogenic outcomes. Meta-analyses and quality assessment using GRADE were performed. The search identified 1660 publications; 36 RCTs were included. For hirsutism, no differences were seen when comparing metformin vs COCP, nor when comparing COCP vs combination treatment with metformin and COCP. Metformin was inferior on free androgen index (FAI) (7.08; 95% CI 4.81, 9.36), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (\u2212118.61 nmol/L; 95% CI \u2212174.46, \u221262.75) and testosterone (0.48 nmol/L; 95% CI 0.32, 0.64) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for FAI (0.58; 95% CI 0.36, 0.80) and SHBG (\u221216.61 nmol/L; 95% CI \u221228.51, \u22124.71) compared with combination treatment, whereas testosterone did not differ. Metformin lowered insulin (\u221227.12 pmol/L; 95% CI \u221240.65, \u221213.59) and triglycerides (\u22120.15 mmol/L; 95% CI \u22120.29, \u22120.01) compared with COCP. COCP was inferior for insulin (17.03 pmol/L; 95% CI 7.79, 26.26) and insulin resistance (0.44; 95% CI 0.17, 0.70) compared with combination treatment. The choice of metformin or COCP treatment should be based on symptoms, noting some biochemical benefits from combination treatment targeting both major endocrine disturbances seen in PCOS (hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism).",
    "body": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects approximately 10% of women globally ( 1 ) and is characterized by chronic anovulation, oligo/amenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovarian morphology, and metabolic and psychological manifestations. PCOS is associated with hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and increased body mass index (BMI). Higher BMI can increase risks of gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease ( 2 , 3 , 4 ). Insulin enhances ovarian and adrenal androgen secretion, exaggerating hyperandrogenic symptoms in PCOS ( 5 ). Androgen excess favors visceral fat deposition and lipid dysfunction with a vicious cycle of worsening of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance ( 6 ). To break the vicious cycle, both insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are key treatment targets in PCOS.  Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing drug, known to inhibit gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis ( 7 ) and prevent weight gain by influencing appetite regulatory pathways in the brain ( 8 ). Several studies have shown that metformin may improve biochemical hyperandrogenism and anovulation ( 9 , 10 ). Generally combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) are regarded as more effective than metformin for the management of hyperandrogenism and menstrual regulation in PCOS ( 11 , 12 ).  COCP, containing estrogen and progestin components, are primarily used as contraception. Due to their direct endometrial effects, COCPs are also used among women with PCOS to regulate the menstrual cycle. A recent systematic review by our group found COCP to be effective in improving menstrual cyclicity and hirsutism in PCOS, with limited evidence for hirsutism ( 13 ). COCPs containing cyproterone acetate (CPA) might be more effective in reducing hirsutism compared to conventional COCPs ( 14 , 15 ); however, the use of COCPs containing CPA is not recommended as first-line treatment due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in the general population ( 12 , 16 ). Overall, finding the most favorable medical treatment for PCOS remains challenging. To treat insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, irregular cycles, and metabolic features, a medical treatment combining COCP and metformin has been suggested ( 17 ).  We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most up-to-date evidence regarding metformin and COCP in the management of clinical and hormonal outcomes in women with PCOS. Results will directly inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS. Subgroup analyses based on BMI and age (adolescent and adult), as well as type of COCP (with or without CPA) were performed to further inform recommendations regarding the optimal treatment for the individual patient.   Materials and Methods  This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted as part of the 2023 update of the International Evidence-based Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of PCOS ( 18 ). We addressed the efficacy of (i) metformin compared to COCP; (ii) COCP monotherapy compared with metformin and COCP; and (iii) metformin monotherapy compared with metformin and COCP in women with PCOS for improving anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and psychological outcomes.   Selection Criteria  The Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (PICO) framework for this systematic review is outlined in Table 1 and was determined by an experienced, multidisciplinary, clinical research team (A.M., T.P., D.R., P.M.S., C.T.T., A.P., S.W., H.T.). Core outcomes were based on a Delphi process involving 700 clinicians, academic opinion leaders, and consumers ( 19 ). Outcomes included anthropometric, metabolic, androgenicity, and psychological outcomes, as well as adverse events (detailed in Table 1 ).   Table 1.

Data Sources  This systematic review and meta-analysis provide an update of a previous systematic review ( 12 ) conducted in 2017 to inform the International Evidence-based Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of PCOS ( 20 ). This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( 21 , 22 ). The study protocol was registered prior to full-text screening in PROSPERO (Registration number CRD42022345640).  Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, All EBM, and CINAHL were searched to identify relevant literature from 2017 until July 7, 2022. We also re-evaluated all articles, which were found in the search performed during the previous systematic review ranging from 1946 to 2017, as well as additional references identified from relevant systematic reviews. Details of the search strategy are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1 ( 23 ).    Study Selection  Two authors (J.M., M.F., or S.A.) independently screened each potential study on title and abstract with the use of COVIDENCE. The same authors performed the full-text screening to determine the final included studies. If there was any doubt about inclusion, the study was reviewed and discussed in a larger group (J.M., M.F., S.A., and C.T.T.).    Quality Appraisal of the Evidence  Quality appraisal of the included studies, in terms of risk of bias (RoB), was performed by J.M. and M.F. using RoB2 ( 24 ). Individual quality items included methods of randomization and group allocation; blinding of patients, carers, investigators, or outcome assessors; methods of outcome assessment and reporting; methods of data analysis; statistical issues; and trial pre-registration. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and re-inspection of the full-text article. Each study was adjudged as having an overall low RoB, some concerns, or high RoB. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method to estimate the certainty of the evidence ( 25 ). GRADE assessments were conducted in duplicate by J.M. and M.F.    Data Extraction  Two independent reviewers (J.M. and M.F.) extracted data from included studies, using a specially developed data extraction form according to selection criteria. Extracted data included a description of the study (authors, country, year of publication, setting, diagnostic criteria for PCOS), participants (mean age and BMI), intervention (dose and duration of metformin and COCP) and study results according to outcome. All units were recalculated to SI units and SD.    Statistical Analysis  Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.4.1. For continuous outcomes we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI and for dichotomous outcomes odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI. Due to clinical heterogeneity from differences in metformin dose, type of COCP, and duration of treatment, random effects models were used for the meta-analyses.  We performed subgroup analyses according to BMI, age (adults and adolescents), and type of COCP. Regarding BMI, studies were sorted into 3 categories; those with participants with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , those with a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 , and studies using other BMI cutoffs (BMI not classified). Participants aged 10 to 19 years were classified as adolescents. Subgroup analyses according to type of COCP were classified into COCP containing CPA and other COCP.  Funnel plots were inspected for the assessment of publication bias.     Results   Study Selection  From 1660 search results, 450 articles were chosen for full-text review. In addition, we screened 176 full texts from the previous search in 2017 ( 12 ). After full-text review, 36 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 46 publications were identified ( Fig. 1 ). Of these, 25 RCTs compared metformin with COCP, 17 compared COCP with metformin and COCP, and 6 compared metformin with metformin and COCP. Study characteristics are presented in Table 2 . The RCTs were performed in Europe (n = 9) ( 26-40 ) North America (n = 4) ( 41-44 ), the Middle East (n = 14) ( 45-58 ), Asia (n = 8) ( 59-66 ), and Australia (n = 1) ( 67-70 ) between 2000 and 2021. Intervention durations ranged from 3 to 24 months, with 6 months of follow-up being the most commonly reported data. Metformin doses ranged from 500 mg to 2000 mg daily, with 1500 to 2000 mg daily being the most common dose (in 28 of the 36 studies). Regarding COCP, all studies used 30 to 35 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol (EE), 20 studies used CPA as the progestin compound, 14 studies used other progestins, and 2 studies had one study arm with participants using EE/drospirenone and another arm with those using EE/CPA ( 26 , 40 ). Four studies involved adolescents ( 41 , 42 , 44 , 49 ) and the remainder focused on adults.   Figure 1.   Included studies are shown in the PRISMA flowchart. The search was performed for 3 medical treatments (combined oral contraceptive pills [COCP], metformin, and anti-androgens) as part of the update of the PCOS guidelines. Results comparing COCP, metformin, and combined COCP and metformin were included in this systematic review.      Table 2.

Risk of Bias  In our systematic review, 2 studies fulfilled the criteria for low RoB, 14 had some concerns, and 20 had a high RoB. All studies adequately described the PCOS diagnostic criteria and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common reason for a high RoB was bias arising from the randomization process. The second most common reason was missing outcome data. RoB assessments of the included studies are shown in Fig. 2 .   Figure 2.   Risk of bias assessments of the included studies.       Meta-analyses  Results on metformin compared with COCP are shown in Table 3 .

We found no evidence of publication bias in the funnel plots.    Anthropometric Outcomes   Metformin vs COCP  Regarding overall results on weight, BMI, and waist to hip ratio (WHR), no differences were found ( Table 3 ).  In subgroup analyses according to BMI and adults/adolescents no differences were seen on weight, BMI and WHR (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3) ( 23 ).  In subgroup analyses comparing metformin with COCP with and without CPA (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S4) ( 23 ) there were no differences in weight. Nevertheless, BMI was lower with metformin when compared with EE/CPA (MD \u22120.99 kg/m 2 ; 95% CI, \u22121.74 to \u22120.23), but not when compared with COCP without CPA.    COCP vs combination  COCP alone compared with combination treatment with COCP and metformin showed no differences in weight, WHR, or BMI ( Table 4 ).    Metformin vs combination  Metformin was superior in lowering WHR (MD \u22120.03; 95% CI, \u22120.06 to \u22120.01) compared with metformin, with no difference in BMI ( Table 5 ).     Clinical and Biochemical Hyperandrogenism   Metformin vs COCP  No difference was seen in hirsutism in the overall analysis but regarding biochemical hyperandrogenism, metformin was inferior to COCP on free androgen index (FAI) (MD 7.08; 95% CI, 4.81 to 9.36), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (MD \u2212118.61 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u2212174.46 to \u221262.75), and testosterone (MD 0.48 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.64) ( Table 3 ).  Subgroup analysis categorized by BMI (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S2) ( 23 ) showed that in women with PCOS and a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , metformin was less effective than COCP in treating hirsutism (MD 1.73; 95% CI, 0.07 to 3.40) and improving FAI (MD 5.78; 95% CI, 2.82 to 8.73), total testosterone (MD 0.56 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.83), and SHBG (MD \u2212168 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u2212211 to \u2212124).  In women with a BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 , there was no difference in hirsutism when comparing metformin with COCP. For biochemical hyperandrogenism, metformin was inferior for FAI (MD 9.05; 95% CI, 6.44 to 11.66); total testosterone (MD 0.40 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66), and SHBG (MD \u221296 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u2212121 to \u221272).  The type of COCP did not influence the overall results regarding clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S4) ( 23 ).    COCP vs combination  No differences were noted in hirsutism between COCP alone and combination treatment. COCP alone was inferior to combination treatment for FAI (MD 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.80), SHBG (MD \u221216.61 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u221228.51 to \u22124.71), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (MD 0.93 \u03bcmol/L; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31), and androstenedione (MD 1.37 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.14 to 2.60), whereas no differences were noted regarding total and free testosterone ( Table 4 ; Supplementary Fig. S5 ( 23 )).    Metformin vs combination  Metformin was inferior for DHEAS (MD 82.38 \u03bcmol/L; 95% CI, 15.43 to 149.36) and total testosterone (MD 0.64 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.02). None of the identified studies reported hirsutism as an outcome for this comparison ( Table 5 ; Supplementary Fig. S6 ( 23 )).     Metabolic Outcomes   Metformin vs COCP  Metformin was more effective in lowering overall fasting insulin levels (MD \u221227.12 pmol/L; 95% CI, \u221240.65 to \u221213.59), total cholesterol (MD \u22120.40 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22120.66 to \u22120.14), triglycerides (MD \u22120.15 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22120.29 to \u22120.01), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (MD \u221211.31 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u221219.78 to \u22122.85) compared with COCP ( Table 3 ). For fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), there were no differences.  In subgroup analyses on women with a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S1) ( 23 ), the metformin-treated group had lower CRP (MD \u221233.09 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u221247.33 to \u221218.84) and HDL (MD \u22120.24 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22120.38 to \u22120.09) compared with COCP. Fasting insulin was lower with metformin regardless of BMI (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S2) ( 23 ).  Metformin was superior to COCP for fasting insulin, both in adults (MD \u221222.17 pmol/L; 95% CI, \u221229.93 to \u221214.42) and adolescents (MD \u221230.03 pmol/L; 95% CI, \u221278.63 to \u221218.56). Metformin was also superior for total cholesterol, both in adults (MD \u22120.34 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22120.60 to \u22120.08) and for adolescents (MD \u22121.12 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22121.74 to \u22120.50) (Supplementary Table S1) ( 23 ). The type of COCP showed no major differences compared with the overall result (Supplementary Table S2) ( 23 ).    COCP vs combination  COCP alone increased fasting insulin (MD 17.03 pmol/L; 95% CI, 7.79 to 26.26), HOMA-IR (MD 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.70), and CRP (MD 1.94 nmol/L; 95% CI, 0.05 to 3.84) compared with combination treatment ( Table 4 ; Supplementary Fig. S5 ( 23 )). In women with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , COCP alone resulted in marginally higher glucose (MD 0.25 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.43) compared with combination treatment.    Metformin vs combination  Metformin alone showed marginally lower fasting glucose (MD \u22120.33 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u22120.64 to \u22120.01) and CRP (MD \u22124.08 nmol/L; 95% CI, \u22126.01 to \u22122.16), compared with a combination treatment ( Table 5 ; Supplementary Fig. S6 ( 23 )).     Cycle Regularity and Quality of Life Outcomes  Metformin was inferior to COCP on restoring regular menses overall (OR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.57), as well as in adults (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.72) and adolescents (OR 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.92).  We were not able to perform a meta-analysis on health-related quality of life. Results from 3 identified studies ( 32 , 42 , 50 ) showed conflicting results and our overall assessment is that there is no difference in quality of life.    Side Effects  Due to lack of systematic reporting, where many studies do not report adverse effects at all or do not report in a similar manner, we were not able to perform a meta-analysis. However, the reports suggest more gastrointestinal side effects with metformin.     Discussion   Main Findings  This extensive systematic review and meta-analysis, including 36 RCTs, was performed to directly inform recommendations on the use of metformin and COCP in women with PCOS, as part of the 2023 update of the International Evidence-based Guidelines on the Assessment and Treatment of PCOS. Our findings showed that metformin was superior to COCP for metabolic outcomes, especially in women with PCOS and a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 , whereas COCP was superior for improving cycle regularity and, in women with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , for improving hirsutism. The combination of metformin and COCP was more effective for improving biochemical hyperandrogenism, insulin levels, and insulin resistance than COCP monotherapy.    Interpretation   Clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism  For many patients with PCOS, medical treatment is indicated to treat clinical hyperandrogenism, including acne and hirsutism. For these symptoms, COCPs have been recommended as first-line treatment. In addition, COCPs regulate menstrual cycles and provide contraception ( 12 , 15 ). In this study we confirm that COCP was superior to metformin for treatment of hirsutism in women with BMI < 25 kg/m 2 , whereas evidence for other BMI groups was of very low quality. However, we found that COCP was superior in improving biochemical hyperandrogenism compared with metformin. A systematic review on COCP treatment in women with PCOS, including both RCTs and non-RCTs, suggested that COCP containing CPA might be more effective in improving hirsutism. However, no direct comparisons between different COCP were made, limiting the conclusions ( 15 ). General population studies have shown that CPA increases the risk of venous thromboembolism compared with other COCP ( 71 , 72 ); hence, COCPs containing CPA are currently not recommended as first-line treatments for PCOS ( 20 ).  No differences were found regarding hirsutism between COCP and combination treatment. Nevertheless, combination treatment was more effective in improving FAI, SHBG, and DHEAS compared with COCP alone. One systematic review ( 17 ) studied hirsutism and acne in PCOS, comparing monotherapy with metformin or COCP with combination treatment, with monotherapy being less effective for hirsutism compared with combination treatment. However, that review also included studies with shorter treatment durations (3 months) hindering interpretation of their findings.  As high insulin levels increase luteinizing hormone\u2013mediated ovarian androgen synthesis ( 73 ), combination treatment presumably targets several distinct mechanisms leading to improved clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism. Thus, combination treatment theoretically offers several benefits. Importantly, additional high-quality prospective studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of these treatment regimens. We also recognize the importance of self-assessment of severity and impact on quality of life, over and above clinical assessment.    Anthropometric outcomes  Women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome ( 74 , 75 ). In our meta-analysis, there were no differences in weight, WHR, and BMI, but evidence was only available with very low certainty. Previously, metformin has been shown to improve BMI compared with placebo ( 76 ). A recent systematic review which included nonrandomized trials found that combined metformin, COCP, and anti-androgen treatment improved BMI and glucose tolerance ( 11 ). However, this study did not compare metformin monotherapy to a combination treatment with metformin and COCP. In our study the combination of COCP and metformin showed no benefit for anthropometric measures compared with COCP alone.    Metabolic outcomes  Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance play important roles in the pathophysiology of PCOS for both normal-weight women and women with obesity ( 2 , 3 , 73 , 77 ). Metformin decreases insulin resistance and insulin levels. COCP does not have any major effects on carbohydrate metabolism in healthy women, whereas the effect on lipid metabolism depends on the level of estrogen and type of progestin, with potential negative effects ( 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 ). Our systematic review confirms that metformin is superior in lowering fasting insulin levels, total cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with COCP, in line with findings reported previously ( 12 ).  Metformin can be used where COCPs are contradicted, in older women, women with obesity or medical conditions (such as migraine with aura, risk of venous thromboembolism or severe hypertension) or where pregnancy is desired. The major disadvantage of metformin treatment is the generally mild, usually self-limited, gastrointestinal side effects, limiting patient acceptance of appropriate doses. We also report that metformin lowered CRP compared with COCP treatment. CRP is often used as a metabolic risk marker and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( 82 ). Metformin has previously been shown to decrease CRP, both in obese and nonobese women, compared with placebo ( 83 ). COCP appears to increase CRP ( 79 , 84 , 85 ), yet the significance of these effects remains unknown.  Importantly, the addition of metformin to COCP improved insulin levels and insulin resistance, as compared with COCP alone. This is of special interest for women with PCOS with additional risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as a high BMI ( 86 , 87 ). Two systematic reviews found that adding metformin to COCP and anti-androgens improved BMI and glucose tolerance ( 11 , 88 ).     Strengths and Limitations  This review presents the most up-to-date evidence on COCP and metformin treatment in women with PCOS. Strengths of the report include the rigorous processes, including PICO developed by clinicians, researchers, and patients; and the large number of RCTs included. Because critical appraisal is inherently subjective, both RoB and GRADE assessments were conducted by 2 authors independently. Several subgroup analyses were included to highlight benefits in population subgroups of interest. Limitations include those inherent in the included studies, with many studies having a high RoB, mainly due to often poorly described randomization processes or lack of blinding. Certainty of evidence was also affected by inconsistency of effect sizes and small sample sizes. Several studies did not provide data on BMI.  Identified research gaps include the lack of larger studies on adolescents with PCOS and on the comparison of metformin with combination treatment. Additional high-quality studies are needed to assess symptoms, especially related to clinical hyperandrogenism rather than biochemical markers of hyperandrogenism. Future directions include understanding mechanisms of action and factors that may impact on medication responses, such as genotype and phenotype of PCOS.     Conclusion  Results from this extensive systematic review and meta-analysis will advise the pending 2023 PCOS guideline update. The guideline will recommend COCP to be used over metformin for management of irregular cycles and hirsutism, and metformin over COCP for metabolic indications in PCOS. While our meta-analyses indicated that the combined treatment with metformin and COCP improved biochemical hyperandrogenism, insulin levels, and insulin resistance more than COCP alone, no difference was seen in clinical outcomes.  For women with PCOS, the choice of treatment should be based on clinical symptoms. Combination treatment appears to be beneficial in high metabolic risk groups, targeting the 2 major endocrine disturbances seen: hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism. Our results, including several sub-analyses, add to the current evidence base and contribute toward reaching the ultimate goal of shared decision-making and effective, tailored, and individualized treatment for patients with PCOS.",
