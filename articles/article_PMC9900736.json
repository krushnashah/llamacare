The role of ferroptosis in PCOS is a novel finding, and the mechanistic studies are not clear. Metformin is a commonly used drug of PCOS but few studies on whether metformin can improve the follicle development and ovarian function in PCOS. We aims to use PCOS mouse model to study the effect of metformin on PCOS based on the ovarian function and explored the regulation of metformin in PCOS mice by intervening in ferroptosis pathway. C57 BL/6J female mice aged 4-5 weeks were purchased and gavaged with letrozole (1 mg/kg/day) combined with high-fat diet for 21days to establish PCOS model, and control group was set up. After modeling, the mice were divided into PCOS model group and metformin treatment group (Met) (n=6).The Met group were gavaged metformin (200 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. The body weight, estrous cycle, glucose tolerance test (OGTT)and insulin resistance test (ITT) were monitored. Then, The mice were euthanized to collect serum and ovaries. Elisa was used to detect changes in related serum hormones (E2, LH, FSH, TP). Ovaries used for molecular biology experiments to detect changes in GPX4, SIRT3, AMPK/p-AMPK, and mTOR/p-mTOR by Western blot and qPCR. Compared with the model group mice, body weight was significantly reduced, and their estrous cycle was restored in Met group. The results of OGTT and ITT showed an improvment of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Morphological results showed that after metformin treatment, polycystic lesions in ovaries were reduced, the ovarian function was restored, and the expressions of SIRT3 and GPX4 were elevated. WB results demonstrated that the expressions of p-mTOR and p-AMPK in ovaries were significantly reduced in Model group, but reversed in MET group. Our study confirmed metformin could not only improve body weight and metabolism disorders, but also improve ovarian dysfunction in PCOS mice.In addition, we explored metformin could regulate ferroptosis to improve PCOS",
    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder, affecting 6%-10% of women of gestational age worldwide ( 1 ). About 50%-70% of PCOS patients also exhibit insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia ( 2 ). Metformin, a classic insulin sensitizer, has been recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as a first-line medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( 3 ) and PCOS ( 4 ). Metformin can improve insulin resistance and obesity,hyperandrogenism, lower serum testosterone levels, and significantly affect PCOS ( 5 \u2013 8 ). However, the underlying mechanism is complex.  Ferroptosis is a new type of iron-dependent programmed cell death ( 9 ), which has been proven to be the center of various metabolic pathways and to play a role in the occurrence and development of numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammation ( 10 \u2013 13 ). More and more studies indicate that ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence of PCOS ( 14 ). It has been reported that SIRT3 increases autophagy and induces ferroptosis by regulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway ( 15 ). Metformin improves insulin sensitivity ( 5 ), which is related to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ( 16 ). However, whether metformin regulates ferroptosis through the SIRT3/AMPK pathway has not been reported.  In this study, a PCOS mouse model was constructed and treated with metformin to investigate the mechanisms that metformin improved ovarian function, and the role played by ferroptosis pathway during this period.And to determine it further that whether metformin could regulate ferroptosis through SIRT3/AMPK pathway. Our study could expand the research on the pathogenic mechanism of PCOS and provide new ideas and directions of treatment mechanisms for PCOS.    2  Materials and methods   2.1  Experimental animal  This animal experiment was reviewed by the Experimental Animal Welfare Ethics Committee of the Experimental Animal Center of Ningxia Medical University and complied with the Principles of Animal Protection, Animal Welfare and Ethics (IACUC). 4-5 weeks-old C57BL/6 J mice weighted 20 \u00b1 2 g were purchased in the Laboratory Animal Center of Ningxia Medical University(10752309202000082). During the test, the mice were guaranteed to eat and drink freely. The living environment temperature was 20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. The relative humidity was 60% - 80%.

The mice in the control group were fed regular food and gavaged with normal saline daily. The mice in the control group were given a high-fat diet and 1 mg/kg of letrozole via gavage for 21 days to establish a PCOS model of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism ( 17 ). The mice, after successful modeling, were randomly divided into PCOS group and metformin group (n=6). During the treatment period, the control group continued to be fed with normal feed and given normal saline; the PCOS group was fed with continuous high-fat feed and given letrozole (1 mg/kg/day) by intragastric administration, and the metformin group was given metformin by intragastric administration (200 mg/kg/day). After 30 days of treatment, the experimental mice were euthanized, serum was collected, one mouse ovary was collected for histological examination, and the other was stored in a \u221280\u00b0C refrigerator for molecular biology experimental research.    2.5  Determination of estrous cycle by vaginal smear  From the 15th day of modeling to the 24th day of treatment, the estrous cycle of mice was detected for 7 consecutive days. Test daily at the same time. Use a Pasteur dropper to absorb an appropriate amount of normal saline, rinse and absorb vaginal secretions on a glass slide, stain with an ultra-fast non-toxic modified Pasteur stain kit, observe the cell morphology under a microscope, and determine the estrous cycle.    2.6  Oral glucose tolerance test  On the 19th day of modeling and the 27th day of treatment, OGTTs were performed repeatedly by taking blood from the tail vein. After fasting for 14-16 h before the experiment, initial blood glucose and body weight were measured. Glucose (3 g/kg) was administered by gavage, and blood glucose was measured 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose administration.    2.7  Insulin tolerance test  Blood was collected from the tail vein for the ITT experiment on the 21st day of modeling and the 29th day of treatment. After fasting for 4-6 h before the experiment, initial blood glucose and body weight were measured after fasting.

By comparing the area under the curve (AUC) and the body shape of the two groups, the same results were obtained (  Supplementary Figures\u00a01B, C  ); After being given metformin treatment, the body weight of the mice decreased significantly (  Figure\u00a01A  ), and the same result was obtained by comparing the body size of the mice (  Figure\u00a01B  ). The glucose tolerance of the mice in the PCOS group was significantly impaired, and the insulin resistance increased (  Supplementary Figures\u00a01D\u2013I  ); After metformin treatment, the abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin resistance of PCOS mice were significantly improved, and the glucose tolerance had become normal (  Figures\u00a01C\u2013H  ).

Mean = SEM, n = 6.       3.2  Metformin improves ovarian function and morphology in PCOS mice  After the female mouse is sexually mature, there will be an apparent periodic estrus process under the action of hormones. The estrous cycle reflects the ovulation and endocrine functions of the female mouse ovary. The estrous cycle was detected seven consecutive days before treatment, and the estrous cycle of the mice in the model group was stagnant in the interphase (  Supplementary Figure\u00a02  ). The estrous cycle of the mice was detected for seven consecutive days before sampling. It was found that the mice in the normal group (  Figure\u00a02A  ) and the treatment group (  Figure\u00a02C  ) had pre-estrus, estrus, post-estrus, and interestrus, and 4-5 days were a cycle; the PCOS (  Figure\u00a02B  ) model mice were in the interestrus phase for seven consecutive days. The smears of vaginal secretions of mice were stained with a modified Pap test kit (  Figure\u00a02D  ). A large number of scattered leukocytes and a small amount of mucus were found in the smears of the PCOS group; a large amount of blue was seen in the smears of the normal group and the treatment group in the proestrus stage. In addition to nucleated epithelial cells and a small number of pink keratinocytes, a large number of pink keratinocytes can be seen in smears in estrus and nucleated epithelial cells. Keratinocytes, and leukocytes can be seen in smears in late estrus, and the number is close to 1:1:1.   Figure\u00a02   Metformin improves ovarian function in PCOS mice.

The ordinate is as follows: 1. Pre-estrus; 2. Estrus; 3. Estrus and 4. Interestrus.     The morphology of mouse ovaries was observed by H&E results showed (  Figure\u00a03A  ) follicles of all levels (primordial follicles, primary follicles, secondary follicles, antral follicles) and corpus luteum were seen in the mice in the normal group, and the structures of follicles and corpus luteum at all levels were complete, and the shapes of various cells were clearly distinguishable; Multiple large antral follicles were seen in PCOS group mice, and the granulosa cells in these large antral follicles were sparse and condensed around the follicles to form a large cavity; the ovarian structure of the mice in the treatment group is complete, the number of large antral follicles is significantly reduced, and the number of follicles at different stages of development is different. The intrafollicular granulosa cell layer was densely aggregated and thickened. The follicles were counted in the ovary (  Figure\u00a03B  ), and the results showed that the number of large antral follicles in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the PCOS model mice, and the number of follicles at other levels was significantly higher than that in the PCOS mice. The serum sex hormone levels of the mice were detected (  Figures\u00a03C\u2013G  ). The serum testosterone (TP) and luteinizing hormone (LH) contents of PCOS mice were significantly increased, the estrogen (E2) content was decreased, and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) content was not significantly altered. After metformin treatment, TP, LH, and LH/FSH content decreased significantly, and the content of estrogen increased significantly.

Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a member of the sirtuin (SIRT) family member that predominantly operates in mitochondria, modulates the mitochondrial oxidative pathway, and reduce oxidative stress ( 20 ). The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence results of GPX4 and SIRT3 showed (  Figures\u00a04A, B  ) revealed that the expression of both decreased in the ovaries of PCOS mice and increased after treatment with metformin. Mouse ovarian proteins GPX4 and SIRT3 were detected by WB and qPCR (  Figures\u00a04C\u2013G  ), and the relative protein densities of the two were counted, and the same results were obtained. This suggested that metformin treatment could increase the expression of GPX4 and SIRT3 in the ovaries of PCOS mice.   Figure\u00a04   Metformin promotes the expression of GPX4 and SIRT3.

The results showed that the expressions of p-mTOR and p-AMPK in the ovaries of PCOS mice were significantly decreased. After treatment with metformin, the expression of both increased. In addition, the expression of Beclin-1 increased and decreased after treatment.   Figure\u00a05   Metformin alters the expression of AMPK and mOTR in the ovaries of PCOS mice.

Clinically, the primary treatments mainly aim at symptomatic relief, as the etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown ( 17 ).  Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is a biguanide antidiabetic drug. It inhibits gluconeogenesis in liver, reduces glucose content, promotes the utilization of peripheral glucose and increases insulin sensitivity to decrease blood glucose levels ( 22 , 23 ). In recent years, metformin has been gradually used as an insulin sensitizer in the treatment of PCOS ( 24 ). However, studies on the mechanism of metformin in improving PCOS mainly focus on the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in PCOS patients ( 24 \u2013 26 ).There are few studies on whether metformin directly improves ovarian function and regulates follicular development. The aim of this paper was first to address the effect of metformin on ovarian function and follicular development. Our study confirmed that metformin could indeed improve metabolic disorders such as body weight and blood glucose in PCOS mice. At the same time, we also found that metformin could improve the estrous cycle of mice, hormone secretion, promote follicular development and normal ovarian ovulation. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be further studied.  Ferroptosis is a mechanism of cell death mediated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress is a fundamental manifestation of ferroptosis ( 12 , 25 ). As a novel finding in the pathogenesis of PCOS, the role of the ferroptosis pathway in the development of PCOS has received increasing attention. Studies have shown that the level of ferroptosis increases in PCOS.The growth of PCOS and the occurrence of associated consequences are affected by mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. The expression of several antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) is decreased, and the accumulation of peroxides results in ferroptosis ( 24 , 26 ). Studies demonstrate that GPX4 is a crucial regulator of iron death in both cells and mice ( 27 ). Our results showed decreased expression of GPX4 in the ovary of model mice and increased ferroptosis. In addition, metformin can protect islet cells, and after treatment with metformin, GPX4 levels increased significantly. It indicates that ferroptosis is involved in the development of PCOS, and metformin can reverse the process of ferroptosis.  Acetylation is one of the post-translational modification pathways of proteins. The acetyl group on acetyl-CoA is transferred to the lysine residue on the target protein through acetyltransferase, thereby altering the 3D conformation of the target protein and changing its biological function ( 28 ). This process can be reversed by deacetylases ( 29 ). Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a member of the sirtuin (SIRT) family, which mainly functions in mitochondria, mediates the mitochondrial oxidative pathway, and reduces oxidative stress ( 20 ). Studies have found that the level of protein lysine acetylation in granulosa cells of PCOS patients is increased, affecting their metabolic equilibrium ( 30 ). In our study, the expression of SIRT3 in the ovaries of PCOS model mice was decreased, and the expression of SIRT3 was restored after treatment with metformin. We delved deeper into the mechanism. SIRT3 can positively regulate the phosphorylation of AMPK ( 15 ). In the absence of SIRT3, it inhibits the AMPK/mTOR pathway, increases autophagy, and induces ferroptosis ( 15 ). Studies have shown the process that metformin directly acted PCOS ( 5 ) was related to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ( 16 ). Metformin can activate AMPK in rat granulosa cells and reduce steroid production ( 31 ). Our study found that the expressions of p-AMPK and p-mTOR were reduced in the ovary of PCOS model mice. The level of ferroptosis was inhibited by the increased expression of GPX4 and SIRT3 in the ovaries of mice following metformin treatment. In the mechanism, it was discovered that p-AMPK and p-mTOR expression increased.  In conclusion, in this study, we first addressed the effect of metformin on ovarian function and follicular development. Then, we explored the regulation of metformin in PCOS mice by intervening in ferroptosis pathway. These two points are the innovations of this paper and complement the application mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.
