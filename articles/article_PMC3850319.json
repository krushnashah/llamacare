    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most\ncommon endocrine disorder in reproductive women.\nIt is estimated that 5-11% of women of reproductive\nage have PCOS ( 1 - 4 ). One of the major diagnostic\ncriteria of PCOS is chronic anovulation which leads\nto irregular menstruation, amenorrhea and infertility;\nthe other diagnostic criterion is hyperandrogenism\nwhich leads to hirsutism, acne, and alopecia.\nWomen with PCOS are at high risk for developing\ncardiovascular diseases (CVDs) ( 5 - 7 ) and exhibit\nendothelial dysfunction. Endothelial progenitor cells\n(EPCs) play an important role in the pathophysiology\nof CVDs. EPCs can home to sites of neovascularization\nand differentiate into endothelial cells\nin response to a variety of stimuli ( 8 - 10 ). PCOS is\nassociated with hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia,\nand insulin resistance, all of which may result in\nEPC dysfunction ( 11 ). Endothelial dysfunction has\nbeen observed in PCOS patients despite normal glycemia,\nlipidemia, and blood pressure, and without\nstructural arterial impairment ( 12 - 16 ). In this review,\nwe summarize the potential mechanisms of\nEPC dysfunction in PCOS, which can result in a\nhigher genesis of CVD in PCOS-affected subjects.   PCOS and CVDs  PCOS-affected women have a number of reproductive\nand metabolic abnormalities. Previous studies of\nPCOS women with body mass index (BMI)-matched\ncontrols have proposed several CVD risk factors related\nto PCOS ( 17 , 18 ). PCOS is frequently associated\nwith obesity, elevated blood pressure, and dyslipidemia\n( 19 , 20 ); all of which are important risk factors for\nCVDs. PCOS patients have increased non-traditional\nrisk factors for CVDs, such as elevated homocysteine\n( 21 - 23 ), C-reactive protein ( 24 ), plasminogen activator\ninhibitor-1 ( 25 ), and fibrinogen ( 26 ) levels. In addition,\nour previous study has found evidence of a widening\nQRS complex (a biomarker for heart failure) on electrocardiogram in PCOS patients ( 27 ).  Through a calcium score analysis, PCOS patients\nhad increased prevalence of coronary artery disease\n(CAD) independent of BMI and age. Shroff et al. have\nreported a correlation between CAD and PCOS using\ncoronary artery calcium and inflammatory markers\n( 28 ). Therefore, PCOS is an important risk factor\nfor CAD. PCOS patients also have an increased risk\nof cerebrovascular diseases ( 29 ). Increased carotid\nintimal-medial thickness and carotid atherosclerotic\nplaque index scores have been reported in PCOS patients\n( 30 , 31 ). Asymmetrical dimethyl-L-arginine\n(ADMA) is an endogenous nitric oxide synthase\n(NOS) inhibitor, which can induce atherosclerosis\nand serve as an independent marker for cardiovascular\nmorbidity ( 32 ). PCOS women have elevated\nADMA ( 33 ), which may induce endothelial dysfunction\nin these patients. The above findings suggest that\nCVD risk, as reflected by endothelial dysfunction, is\nincreased in PCOS patients. Table 1 summarizes the\nclinical evidence of PCOS in CVDs.    EPC dysfunction contributes to CVDs  EPCs play critical roles in endothelial function\nand the genesis of atherosclerosis ( 34 , 35 ). Bone\nmarrow-derived peripheral EPCs can home to sites\nof vessel growth, where they proliferate and differentiate\ninto mature endothelial cells for neovascularization\n( 10 ). Aging, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,\nand stroke are associated with impaired\nneovascularization, which may be caused by EPC\ndysfunction ( 36 , 37 ). Peripheral EPCs isolated\nfrom CAD patients are significantly declined, revealing\nan impaired migratory response ( 38 ). Similarly,\ndecreased EPCs may result in a poor outcomes\nafter ischemic stroke ( 39 ).  Circulating EPC numbers and function were significantly\nreduced in diabetic patients with peripheral\nartery disease (PAD), and the severity of carotid stenosis\nwas negatively correlated with the EPC number\nin these patients ( 40 ). In addition, angiotensin II and\noxidative stress possibly contribute to reduced EPC\nnumber and function through activation of the AT1a\nreceptor ( 41 ). Therefore, EPCs significantly contribute\nto the pathophysiology of CVDs.    Potential EPC disorders in PCOS  Endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in\nPCOS patients ( 13 , 42 ). EPCs have been shown to\nplay a critical role in regulating endothelial function\n( 43 - 45 ). According to recent studies, PCOS\npatients have reduced EPC numbers and impaired\nEPC function along with increased central arterial\nstiffness. Our studies have reported the presence of\nhyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in PCOS\npatients ( 46 , 47 ), which may result in EPC dysfunction\nthrough increased reactive oxygen species and\nimpaired insulin signaling ( 48 ). When EPCs from\ninsulin-resistant Zucker fatty rats were exposed to\ntumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, there was increased apoptosis\nand decreased AKT phosphorylation in the\nEPCs, which suggested that inflammation could\ninduce EPC dysfunction. In addition, our studies\nfound that hyperglycemia significantly modulated\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor and\ncardiac inflammation ( 49 , 50 ), which were effects\nthat have been shown to impair EPC function ( 51 ).\nSince PCOS is associated with a hyper-inflammatory\nstatus, inflammation-related EPC dysfunction\ncould contribute to increased CVDs in PCOS patients.\nAccording to Gallagher et al. diabetic mice\nhave an approximately 50% reduction in circulating\nEPCs compared to non-diabetic controls ( 52 ).\nPCOS is frequently combined with obesity, which\ncan induce inflammation and oxidative stress, thus\nresulting in ( 42 ) EPC dysfunction. Oxidized lowdensity\nlipoprotein has been shown to impair EPC\nmigration and endothelial NOS. Therefore, dyslipidemia\nfrom PCOS can also produce EPC dysfunction.  The prevalence of insufficient vitamin D is higher\nin PCOS patients ( 53 ). Vitamin D dysregulation\nand deficiency is correlated with CVDs and affects\nEPCs ( 54 , 55 ). Therefore, administration of vitamin\nD may have beneficial effects on CVD risk factors\nin PCOS patients ( 56 - 58 ). Accordingly, vitamin D\ndeficiency may reduce the EPC number and function\nin PCOS patients as a result of developing\nCVDs. Various environmental chemical toxicants\nhave also been implicated in endocrine disruption\nthat may be associated with PCOS. PCOS patients\nhave a higher blood level of bisphenol A (BPA),\nan estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemical used\nto produce plastics ( 59 ). Since chemical toxicants\nincrease CVDs and are known to affect EPCs ( 60 , 61 ), it is possible that chemical toxicants may reduce\nthe EPC number and function in PCOS patients,\nthus increasing CVDs.

Conclusion  PCOS is an independent marker of long-term\ncardiovascular risk and plays an important role in\nthe pathophysiology of CVDs. EPCs maintain endothelial\nrepaired capacity in mature blood vessels.\nImpaired EPC number and function will produce\nendothelial dysfunction and CVD progression ( Fig 1 ). Therefore, EPC dysregulation may contribute\nto the genesis of CVDs in PCOS patients.
