    "body": "Androgen excess is a defining feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is one\nof the most common endocrine disorders in women and is associated with reproductive and\nmetabolic complications ( 1 ). The origin of\nandrogen excess in PCOS has not been conclusively determined and may differ with\nphenotype variability, but it is clear that both ovaries and adrenals contribute to\nincreased circulating androgens in affected women. Previous work has highlighted that\nwomen with PCOS show evidence of systemic upregulation of\n5 \u03b1 -reductase activity ( 2,\n3 ), which activates testosterone (T) to the most potent androgen,\n5 \u03b1 -dihydrotestosterone. Recently, it was reported that\ndaughters of women with PCOS show evidence of increased\n5 \u03b1 -reductase activity during infancy ( 4 ) prior to adrenarche- and puberty-related increases in androgen\nproduction.  Traditionally, serum T has been used as a biochemical marker for androgen excess in the\ncontext of PCOS, but this has been fraught with difficulties, largely due to the low\ncirculating concentrations in women as well as the specificity and sensitivity issues of\nthe assays used. Recently, the T precursor androstenedione (A4) has been shown to be a\nmore sensitive marker of PCOS-related androgen excess and, in combination with T,\npredictive of metabolic risk ( 5 ). These findings\nwere confirmed by another group ( 6 ), and the\ndiagnostic value of A4 has been recognized in recent position statements ( 7 ).  It has been known for decades that the adrenal is capable of converting A4 to\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA4) ( 8 ), catalyzed by the 11 \u03b2 -hydroxylase\nactivity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme cytochrome P450\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxylase, but it was thought to represent an\ninsignificant metabolite. However, recent studies have demonstrated that 11OHA4 is a\nmajor product of adrenal steroidogenesis ( 9 ) and\nthat its downstream conversion through the 11-oxygenated C19 steroid pathway ( Fig. 1 ) generates 2 steroids, 11-ketotestosterone\n(11KT) and 11-keto-5 \u03b1 -dihydrotestosterone ( 10 ), that bind and activate the androgen receptor with affinities\nand potencies similar to that of T and 5 \u03b1 -dihydrotestosterone,\nrespectively ( 11 ).

The role of 11-oxygenated C19 steroids in PCOS has not been comprehensively delineated. A\nnumber of previous studies have attempted to evaluate the role of 11OHA4 in PCOS, but\nresults have been inconclusive ( 12\u201314 ). To our knowledge, none of these studies examined the role of\nother 11-oxygenated androgens in global androgen metabolism in women with PCOS.\nFurthermore, the majority of these early studies relied on radioimmunoassays, now\nlargely surpassed by the advent of modern liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry\n(LC-MS/MS) assays. Therefore, we have examined the contribution of this poorly\ncharacterized androgen pathway to overall androgen excess in a large cohort of women\nwith PCOS by mass spectrometry\u2013based analysis of serum and urinary steroids, in\ncomparison with a healthy female control cohort and in relation to surrogate makers of\nmetabolic risk.   Materials and Methods   Subjects and clinical protocol  Women with PCOS aged between 18 and 40 years were recruited from outpatient\nclinics at University Hospital Birmingham and Birmingham Women\u2019s\nHospital. Full ethical approval was obtained from the South Birmingham and\nEdgbaston Research Ethics Committees (reference numbers LREC5835 and\n12/WM/0206). All participants provided written informed consent. PCOS was\ndiagnosed according to the Rotterdam European Society of Human Reproduction and\nEmbryology 2004 criteria, requiring the presence of 2 or more of the following\nfeatures: oligo/anovulation, clinical signs of hyperandrogenism or biochemical\nandrogen excess, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound ( 1 ). Other potential causes of oligomenorrhea and androgen\nexcess were excluded by history, physical examination, and biochemical\nassessment. Healthy control subjects were recruited via local advertisement,\nwith the exclusion of PCOS on clinical and biochemical grounds. This was done by\nobtaining a menstrual history, by direct questioning regarding clinical features\nof androgen excess, and by biochemical analysis of serum androgens. Individuals\nwith menstrual disturbance and clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism were\nexcluded. Exclusion criteria for the study were as follows: recent\nglucocorticoid treatment (within 3 months), pregnancy, age younger than 18 or\nolder than 40 years, recent oral contraceptive use (within 3 months),\nhyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and frank hyperglycemia.  Study participants attended the National Institutes of Health Research/Wellcome\nTrust Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Birmingham after an\novernight fast. A precollected 24-hour urine sample for urinary steroid\nmetabolite analysis was provided by each patient on the morning of assessment.\nBaseline anthropometric data were collected, and blood samples were drawn for\nfasting glucose and insulin and for measurement of the serum concentrations of\nclassic and 11-oxygenated C19 steroids.    Serum steroid analysis  All serum steroids were measured by LC-MS/MS. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\n(DHEAS) was extracted from 20 \u03bcL serum by the addition of 20 \u03bcL\n0.1 mM ZnSO 4 and 100 \u03bcL acetonitrile and quantified in\nnegative mode using a mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ; Waters, Milford, MA) coupled\nto an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) as previously described ( 5, 15 ). All other steroids were\nextracted from 400 \u03bcL serum using 2 mL methyl tert -butyl\nether as previously described ( 5, 16,\n17 ). Serum T, A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 11OHA4,\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxytestosterone (11OHT), and 11KT were\nquantified using a mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S; Waters) coupled to an ACQUITY\nUPLC system (Waters). The serum steroids were separated using a UPLC\nhigh-strength silica T3 column (2.1 mm \u00d7 50 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm) (Waters)\nand 1% formic acid (A) and 100% methanol (B) as mobile phases. Separation was\nachieved using a 5-minute linear gradient from 55% A to 75% B at a constant flow\nrate of 0.6 mL/min and a column temperature of 50\u00b0C. All steroids were\nanalyzed in multiple reaction monitoring using the settings reported by Quanson et al. ( 16 ).\nComprehensive validation data for the 11-oxygenated steroids are shown in Supplemental Table 1 . Serum\n11-ketoandrostenedione (11KA4) was quantified using an ACQUITY UPC 2 system (Waters) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S; Waters) as previously\nreported ( 16 ). Data collection and\nanalysis were performed using MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Steroids were identified by\nmatching retention times and 2 mass transitions and were quantified by referring\nto a linear calibration series with appropriate deuterated reference compounds\nas internal standards.    Urinary steroid measurement  Urinary steroid metabolites were measured using quantitative gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode as previously\ndescribed ( 18 ). The steroid metabolites\nrelevant to this study are shown in Table\n1 and Figure 1 . The production\nof steroids from the classic androgen pathway was measured by the quantification\nof the major androgen metabolites androsterone (An) and etiocholanolone (Et).\nThe major 11-oxygenated C19 metabolite\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxyandrosterone\n(11 \u03b2 -OH-An) was measured to assess the contribution of\nthe 11-oxygenated C19 steroid pathway.

Biochemical analysis  Insulin was measured using a commercially available assay (Mercodia, Uppsala,\nSweden) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Plasma glucose was\nmeasured using the 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs,\nOH). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated\nusing the formula [fasting glucose (mmol/L)*fasting insulin\n(mU/L)/22.5].    Statistical analysis  Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS),\nVersion 22. Results are presented as median [interquartile range (IQR)] unless\notherwise stated. For comparison of single variables, t tests\n(paired or unpaired as appropriate) were used. Nonparametric equivalents where\nused where data were not normally distributed. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey testing was used for multiple comparisons\nbetween different groups. Due to nonnormality of data distribution,\nSpearman\u2019s Rho was used for correlation testing between continuous\nvariables. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.     RESULTS   Baseline demographics of patients and control subjects  A total of 49 control subjects and 114 women with PCOS were included in the\nstudy. After application of the Rotterdam criteria, the prevalence of the 4\nRotterdam-derived phenotypes was as follows: phenotype A (androgen excess,\nanovulation, and polycystic ovaries), 59.7%; phenotype B (androgen excess,\npolycystic ovaries), 6.9%; phenotype C (androgen excess, anovulation), 23.6%;\nphenotype D (anovulation, polycystic ovaries) 9.7%. Control subjects and women\nwith PCOS were matched for age ( P = 0.18); however, women with\nPCOS had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than age-matched control\nsubjects [median BMI 31.2 kg/m 2 (IQR, 27.0 to 36.2) vs 23.7 kg/m 2 (IQR, 21.2 to 26.1), respectively; P < 0.001] ( Table\n1 ). Using a BMI cut-off of 30 kg/m 2 , 51 and 63 women with\nPCOS were categorized as nonobese and obese, respectively. The BMI in nonobese\nwomen with PCOS did not differ from control subjects ( P =\n0.35). HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in obese patients with PCOS than\nin control subjects ( P < 0.001).    Both classic and 11-oxygenated androgens are significantly increased in\nPCOS  LC-MS/MS analysis of serum androgens in the patients with PCOS revealed\nsignificantly increased concentrations of the classic androgen T and its\nprecursors A4 and DHEA (all P < 0.001) as well as DHEAS\n( P = 0.002) when compared with control subjects ( Fig. 2 ).   Figure 2.   Serum concentrations of (A, B) classic and (C\u2013F) 11-oxygenated\nsteroids in women with PCOS (n = 114) and healthy sex- and age-matched\ncontrol subjects (n = 49). (G\u2013I) Major urinary androgen\nmetabolite deriving from the classic androgen pathway, An and\netiocholanolone (Et), and the\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxyandrostenedione metabolite\n11 \u03b2 -OH-An.     Serum concentrations of the 11-oxygenated androgens 11OHA4, 11OHT, 11KA4, and\n11KT were all significantly higher in the PCOS cohort ( P < 0.001 for 11OHA4 and 11KA4; P < 0.01 for 11OHT\nand 11KT) ( Fig. 2 ). Indeed, the\nproportionate contribution of 11-oxygenated steroids to total serum androgens\nwas significantly higher in patients with PCOS than in control subjects [53.0%\n(IQR, 48.7 to 60.3) vs 44.0% (IQR, 32.9 to 54.9); P < 0.0001] ( Fig.\n3 ). Serum concentrations of 11KT were significantly higher than those\nof T in control subjects and women with PCOS ( P < 0.001\nfor both). It should be noted that the lower limit of quantification for 11OHT\nwas 0.65 nmol/L; although 11OHT was detected in the majority of samples, only a\nsingle control patient had a value above the lower limit of quantification. By\ncontrast, 22 patients with PCOS had values above this cut-off.   Figure 3.   Relative contribution (median; %) of the classic androgen pathway (DHEA,\nA4, T; shades of blue) and the 11-oxygenated C19 steroid pathway\n(11OHA4, 11KA4, 11OHT, 11KT; shades of red) to the total circulating\nandrogenic steroid pool, comparing patients with PCOS (n = 114) with\nsex- and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 49).     Correspondingly, urinary 24-hour excretion of the classic androgen metabolites An\nand Et was significantly higher in women with PCOS ( P = 0.004\nand 0.005, respectively) ( Fig. 2 ).  Similarly, the excretion of the urinary metabolite of 11OHA4,\n11 \u03b2 -OH-An, was significantly increased in patients\nwith PCOS [595 (IQR, 347 to 861) vs 353 (IQR, 171 to 487) in\ncontrol subjects; P < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 ).    11-oxygenated androgens are increased in PCOS independent of BMI  Serum concentrations of classic androgens (T, A4, DHEA, and DHEAS) and\n11-oxygenated androgens (11OHA4, 11KA4, 11OHT, and 11KT) did not differ\nsignificantly between obese and nonobese women with PCOS. Similarly, urinary\nexcretion of classic androgen metabolites An, Et, and DHEA and the 11-oxygenated\nmetabolite 11 \u03b2 -OH-An were similar in nonobese and obese\nwomen with PCOS.  We examined this further by comparing the nonobese PCOS group (n = 51) with\nhealthy control subjects (n = 49). Nonobese women with PCOS were matched for\nage, BMI, and HOMA-IR with healthy control subjects ( Table 1 ). Serum concentrations of the classic androgens T\n( P < 0.01), A4 ( P < 0.001),\nDHEA ( P < 0.05), and DHEAS ( P <\n0.01) were all higher in the nonobese PCOS cohort than in BMI-matched control\nsubjects. Mirroring this, serum levels of 11OHA4 and 11KA4 ( P < 0.001 for both) as well as 11OHT ( P < 0.01)\nwere all significantly increased in nonobese women with PCOS compared with\ncontrol subjects. There was a trend toward higher serum levels of 11KT in the\nnonobese PCOS group, but this did not reach statistical significance\n( P = 0.10).  Looking at urinary androgen metabolism, excretion of the 11-oxygenated androgen\nmetabolite 11 \u03b2 -OH-An was significantly higher in the\nnonobese PCOS cohort [595 (IQR, 438 to 841) vs 353 (IQR, 171 to\n487) in controls; P = 0.002], whereas there was only a trend\ntoward significantly higher urinary excretion of An ( P = 0.07).\nExcretion of Et and DHEA did not differ between nonobese women with PCOS and\ncontrol subjects. Serum 11OHA4, 11KA4, 11OHT, and 11KT all correlated\nsignificantly with urinary excretion of 11 \u03b2 -OH-An\n( R = 0.39, 0.39, 0.33, and 0.40, respectively; P < 0.01 for each; for details see Supplemental Table 2 ).    11-oxygenated androgens correlate with markers of metabolic risk  The 11-oxygenated androgen precursors 11OHA4 and 11KA4 correlated significantly\nwith BMI ( R = 0.31, P < 0.01 and R = 0.37, P < 0.01, respectively).\nBoth also had significant correlations with insulin ( R = 0.19, P < 0.05 and R = 0.30, P < 0.01, respectively) and HOMA-IR\n( R = 0.21, P < 0.05 and R = 0.32, P < 0.01, respectively).\nBy contrast, we did not observe significant associations with BMI, insulin, or\nHOMA-IR for 11KT and 11OHT.  The free androgen index (FAI) (serumTx100/SHBG) correlated significantly with\nBMI, insulin, and HOMA-IR ( P < 0.01 for each) ( Table 2 ). The FAI also correlated\npositively with all serum 11-oxygenated androgens.

Discussion  We have performed a comprehensive comparison of classic and 11-oxygenated androgens\nin women with PCOS. We found that all measured 11-oxygenated steroids, including the\npotent androgen 11KT, were significantly increased in women with PCOS compared with\ncontrol subjects. Previous studies from the early 1990s had reported increased\nlevels of 11OHA4 in PCOS. However, those studies were mostly reliant on immunoassays\nrather than sensitive and specific mass spectrometry and contained no data on\nfurther downstream metabolism of 11OHA4 ( 12\u201314 ). Intriguingly, we could show that 11-oxygenated androgens\nconstitute the majority of the circulating, unconjugated androgen excess in PCOS,\nwhich strongly suggests that they are important contributors to PCOS-related\nhyperandrogenism. Although it could be argued that the shift in favor of\n11-oxygenated androgens is due to the abundance of the inactive androgen precursors\n11OHA4 (34.9%) and 11KA4 (16.4%), the levels of active 11-oxygenated androgens also\nexceeded those of classical androgens. Indeed, median circulating concentrations of\n11KT were more than threefold higher than those of T in PCOS, traditionally the\nandrogen measured most commonly in clinical practice in the disorder. It is\ntherefore highly likely that 11KT is a major player in PCOS-related androgen excess,\nespecially given that 11KT can activate the androgen receptor in a similar manner to\nT ( 9\u201311,\n19\u201321 ), and can be converted to the even more potent androgen\n11-ketodihydrotestosterone in peripheral target tissue ( 10, 11 ). Further studies are required to delineate the\nrelative contributions of these androgens and their downstream activation in target\ntissues on metabolic risk in PCOS. These data also underpin the crucial role of the\nadrenal gland in contributing to PCOS-related androgen excess because the first step\nof the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway is dependent on the\n11 \u03b2 -hydroxylation of A4 to 11OHA4 by adrenal cytochrome\nP450 11 \u03b2 -hydroxylase.  These results are in broad agreement with a recent study that investigated the\ncontribution of 11-oxygenated androgens to the androgen pool in another androgen\nexcess state, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase\ndeficiency (21OHD). In their study, Turcu et al. ( 22) found that 11OHA4, 11OHT, 11KA4, and 11KT\nwere all significantly elevated in male and female patients with 21OHD when compared\nwith age- and sex-matched control subjects. The authors concluded that the\n11-oxygenated androgens represent potentially novel biomarkers of adrenal-derived\nandrogen excess and that 11KT may be the most clinically relevant androgen in\npatients with 21OHD. However, there are differences in the absolute serum\nconcentrations of the 11-oxygenated steroids reported for the control samples\nmeasured in our study and that of Turcu et al. ( 22 ). Rege et al. ( 9) have also previously measured the levels of\n11-oxygenated C19 steroids in the adrenal vein and peripheral circulation of female\npatients with primary aldosteronism. For comparison, we have pulled together the\ndata from the 2 previous studies in direct comparison with our results in Table 3 . In all cases, 11OHA4 is the most\nabundant 11-oxygenated C19 steroid, and 11KT levels are higher than those of 11OHT.\nDifferences in absolute levels may be ascribed to differences in the composition of\nthe control groups, sample sizes, and sex-specific variability as well as\ndifferences in extraction and LC-MS/MS protocols ( 23 ). For example, the control group for the 21OHD study consisted of\nboth male (n = 19) and female (n = 19) subjects, with an age range between 3 and 59\nyears, whereas the control group from this study consisted only of female subjects\n(n = 49) aged 18 to 40 years. To the best of our knowledge, deuterated internal\nstandards for 11KA4, 11OHT, and 11KT are not currently commercially available,\nthereby complicating the quantification of these steroids by LC-MS/MS. Nonetheless,\ncomparisons between control groups and patient groups within these individual\nstudies unequivocally demonstrate that the 11-oxygenated androgens are significantly\nelevated in both PCOS and 21OHD. Further studies with larger cohorts, as well as\nwith the use of deuterated 11-oxygenated internal standards, are therefore required\nto establish reliable reference ranges in health and disease.

Abbreviations: CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; SEM, standard error\nof the mean.     This study has validated our observation from previously published work that A4 is a\nsurrogate marker of metabolic risk in PCOS, confirming significant positive\nassociations with BMI, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR ( 5 ). In this study we found that the serum concentrations of the\n11-oxygenated androgen precursors 11OHA4 and 11KA4 also significantly correlate with\nBMI, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR. Hence, these steroids may have additional value\nas surrogate markers of metabolic risk in PCOS. This finding is perhaps not entirely\nsurprising given that 11OHA4 and 11KA4 are derivatives of A4 and that highly\nsignificant correlations are observed between all 3 steroids ( Table 2 ).  Not only obese but also nonobese women with PCOS had significantly higher levels of\n11OHA4, 11KA4, and 11OHT than BMI-matched healthy control subjects, and levels of\nall 11-oxygenated androgens did not differ between obese and nonobese women with\nPCOS. By contrast, HOMA-IR was only significantly increased in the obese patients.\nIt is unclear why the serum levels of 11OHA4 and 11KA4 did not differ between obese\nand nonobese women with PCOS given the above-described significant association of\nthese steroids with BMI. Unfortunately, our patient number did not allow a\ncorrelation analysis split by subgroup with sufficient statistical power. A4 is\nalready a suitable surrogate marker of metabolic risk in PCOS. It is, however,\nimportant that future studies investigate the role of these androgen precursors in\nmetabolic target tissues because their metabolism and consequent activity may well\ndiffer.  Our results may also suggest that androgen excess precedes androgen-driven insulin\nresistance and subsequent weight gain in the pathophysiological sequence of PCOS.\nAndrogen-mediated effects on adipose tissue function and fat mass expansion are\nincreasingly recognized ( 24 ), and classic\nandrogen pathway serum androgens correlate closely with adipose tissue mass in women\n( 25 ). Prenatal androgen exposure is\nassociated with adipocyte hypertrophy and increased fat mass in rodent and sheep\nmodels ( 26, 27 ). Women with early-onset\nandrogen excess in PCOS may therefore be predisposed to androgen-mediated obesity in\nlater adulthood, fueling a vicious circle of androgen excess, weight gain, and\nhyperinsulinemia ( 5 ).  A key factor in peripheral androgen metabolism is aldo-keto reductase type 1C3\n(AKR1C3), which converts A4 to T. AKR1C3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue\n( 28 ), and its expression in subcutaneous\nadipose tissue is increased not only in subjects with simple obesity ( 29 ) but also in women with PCOS ( 30 ). In our study, BMI correlated significantly\nwith serum T, supporting the conversion of A4 to T by AKR1C3 in adipose tissue.\nConversely, 11OHA4 is not a substrate for AKR1C3 ( 10 ) and thus cannot be converted to 11OHT in adipose tissue. Similarly,\nalthough 11KA4 is a substrate for AKR1C3 ( 10 ), the expression of 11 \u03b2 -hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase type 1 in adipose tissue ( 31 )\nmay minimize its conversion to 11KT because 11 \u03b2 HSD1\nefficiently converts 11KA4 to 11OHA4, which is not a substrate for AKR1C3 ( 10, 32 ). These conversions are supported by\nthe observation that although 11OHT and 11KT levels are significantly elevated in\nPCOS, neither 11OHT nor 11KT correlated with BMI. This finding further supports the\nidea that androgen excess drives weight gain in PCOS. Our observations therefore\nprovide further evidence for a causal link between androgen excess and metabolic\ndysfunction in PCOS.  In summary, we have demonstrated that 11-oxygenated androgens are significantly\nelevated in obese and nonobese women with PCOS and cumulatively constitute a greater\nproportion of total circulating androgens than classic androgens. This observation\nhas not been replicated in healthy control subjects, where classic androgens appear\nto constitute the majority of the circulating androgen pool. Intriguingly, 11KT\ncirculates in significantly higher concentrations than T, both in women with PCOS\nand control subjects, opening up avenues for the exploring the origins of androgen\nexcess in PCOS. Close correlation of a number of 11-oxygenated steroids with\nhyperinsulinemia further highlight a potential important role for these steroids as\nbiomarkers not only of androgen excess but also of insulin resistance, metabolic\ndysfunction, and tissue-specific androgen activation in PCOS.",
