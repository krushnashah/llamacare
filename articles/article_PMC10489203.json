    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a sophisticated endocrine disease seen in approximately 10% of women. [ 1 ] The diagnosis of PCOS disease is generally made according to the Rotterdam criteria. [ 2 ] According to these criteria, it is necessary to have 2 of the oligo- and/or anovulation, polycystic ovaries, and clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism criteria. The pathogenesis of PCOS is not fully understood. There is evidence that clinically PCOS is caused by the combination of genetic factors such as defects in the gonadotropic axis, impaired insulin efficiency, disorders of androgen production mechanisms, and environmental factors such as diet and obesity. [ 3 ] Many risk factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, family history, and use of antiseizure medications have been defined in the etiology. [ 4 \u2013 6 ] Polycystic ovary syndrome is divided into 4 different phenotypic groups as clinical, biochemical, and radiological. [ 7 ] In the treatment of PCOS, together with diet and exercise lifestyle changes, medications such as oral contraceptives, metformin, and antiandrogens are used. [ 8 ]  It has been shown in previous publications that there is a link between ABO/Rh blood groups and many cancer types and metabolic and autoimmune diseases. [ 9 ] The clearest relation between ABO/Rh blood groups and cancer has been shown in many studies between stomach cancer and A blood group. [ 10 ] Blood group A is in 9 different types of cancer (oral cavity, stomach, pancreas, stomach, liver, ovary, cervix, bladder, and breast), blood group AB in 3 different cancer types (stomach, pancreas, ovary), and blood group B in 2 different types of cancer (nonmelanoma, skin cancers, and esophagus) has been found to be a risk factor. [ 11 ] Relationships between endocrine diseases and ABO/Rh blood groups were examined in some studies. In the study examining the clinical manifestations of patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, it was shown that 94% of the metastatic patients had O blood group. [ 12 ] In other study, it was shown that the O blood group in patients with Hashimoto Hypothyroidism increased statistically significantly compared to other hypothyroid patients. [ 13 ] It is not fully understood how ABO/Rh blood groups lead to the development of endocrine diseases, cancer, and other diseases. In some studies, it has been determined that these diseases may occur as a result of the inflammation triggered by the disorders in the enzymatic pathway that produces the blood group antigens expressed in the tissues. [ 14 \u2013 16 ] In this study, it was goaled to examine the relation between PCOS, which is a complex endocrine disease whose pathogenesis is not fully known, and ABO/Rh factor blood groups. In addition, differences in baseline clinical and biochemical factors were evaluated according to ABO/Rh blood groups in patients with PCOS.    2. Material and Method   2.1. Data collection and patients  An observational, retrospective case-control methodology was used to design the study. Prior to conducting the study, approval from the ethics committee was obtained, and good clinical practice principles were followed. All patients with PCOS who were treated and treated in a single-center endocrinology outpatient clinic between 2019 and 2022 were involved in the study. The patients were determined from the hospital data processing system. All PCOS patients who had baseline clinical, biochemical, and ABO/Rh blood group data were involved in the study. Patients with missing ABO/Rh blood group data were excluded from the study. Patient data were noted from hospital follow-up files and the Ministry of Health Patient Information System. The clinical complaints of the patients were questioned, and their medical histories and drug use were recorded. Patients were diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria. Individuals with at least 2 of the following criteria: oligoovulation (and/or anovulation), hyperandrogenemia, and the ultrasound findings were diagnosed with PCOS. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance score was calculated using the formula (fasting insulin level X fasting blood glucose/405). Individuals with a Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance level above 2.5 were considered to have insulin resistance. The body mass index of the patients was measured using the formula (body weight/height 2 ), and individuals with body mass index > 30\u2009kg/m2 were considered obese. The presence of biochemical hyperandrogenemia was defined as serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone levels above the normal range.  The ABO/Rh blood groups were determined by the gel centrifugation method. The patient\u2019s blood group distribution was compared with healthy individuals blood group distribution. As the control group, 2019 Turkish Red Crescent healthy blood donors data were used. The number of healthy individuals who were blood donors in 2019 was 2809,237. ABO/Rh blood group distributions of the patients and the control group were compared in general and blood group specific. In addition, the relationship of blood groups with basal clinical and biochemical features was evaluated.    2.2. Statistical analysis  The statistics of the study were obtained via SPSS 29 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Continuous variables in the study were represented by median (as well as minimum and maximum values) value numbers and percentages, while categorical variables were described by numbers and percentages. ABO/Rh blood group distributions in the patient group and healthy control group were performed using the Fisher exact test and chi-square test. When the P value was < .05, results were deemed statistically significant, and the probability ratio was calculated.     3. Results   3.1. Patient characteristic  The study analysis was performed using data from 265 patients. The average age of the included patients was 23 (16\u201342). The average follow-up period of the patients was 27 (1.5\u201352) months. Forty-nine (18.5%) patients had additional comorbidities. The most frequent signs at the time of diagnosis were hirsutism (86%) and oligomenorrhea (80.9%). The number of patients whose baseline ultrasonography levels were compatible with PCOS was 166 (62.6%). Insulin resistance was present in 111 (41.9%) patients. The number of patients using medical treatment for PCOS was 215 (81.1%). The clinical and therapeutic features of the patients are displayed in Table 1 below.

ABO/Rh blood group distributions  Blood group distributions were compared in patients and healthy control groups. ABO/Rh blood group distributions were found to be comparable between the 2 groups ( P = .9) (Table 2 ). In addition, blood group distributions were specifically compared in both groups (Table 3 ). Although the distributions of AB blood group in the patients was increased minimally compared to the frequency of non-AB blood group (95 confidence interval [CI], Odds ratio: 1.17), and the frequency of O blood group was decreased minimally compared to the frequency of non-O blood group (95 CI, Odds ratio: 0.91), no statistically significant difference was found. Clinical and biochemical features were compared according to ABO blood group distribution. Oligomenorrhea ( P = .8), hirsutism ( P = .9), hair loss ( P = .6), acne ( P = .1), obesity ( P = .7), high androgen level ( P = .1), insulin resistance ( P = .1) and ultrasound characteristics ( P = .3), there was no difference detected. The distribution of the Rh factor revealed no statistically significant variation between clinical and biochemical parameters.

Discussion  In many studies, the relationship between endocrine-metabolic diseases and blood group was examined, and in some studies, significant relationships were detected. [ 9 ] There have been some studies examining the relation between different ovarian diseases and ABO blood groups. In a study evaluating the relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and blood group, it was detected that blood group A might be a risk factor for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. [ 17 ] In another cohort study evaluating infertile women under the age of 40, no relationship was found between ovarian reserve and ABO blood group. [ 18 ] In a meta-analysis examining ABO/Rh blood groups and infertility status or ovarian reserve, the opposite result was found, and it was determined that infertility and assisted reproductive technology were not affected by ABO/Rh blood groups. [ 19 ] In another study evaluating 35,479 infertile women, it was found that decreased ovarian reserve increased in women with B blood group and decreased in women with O blood group. [ 20 ] In addition, there are studies examining the relation between ovarian cancer and ABO blood groups in the literature. A study evaluating 234 ovarian cancer patients was found that having blood type B may be a risk factor for ovarian cancer (95% CI, RR = 1.41). [ 21 ] Conversely, In the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium study, which included 8 studies, it was determined that blood group A was slightly increased in patients with ovarian cancer (95% CI, OR: 1.09, P = .03). [ 22 ]  The predisposing gene that causes polycystic ovarian cancer is located in the 9q33.3 region, while the ABO gene is located in the 9q34.2 region. [ 23 ] In some studies, the relation between ABO blood group and ovarian reserve and the presence of PCOS and ABO blood group genes in the same chromosomal region have brought up the idea that there may be a relationship between PCOS and blood group. In this study, it was detected that there was no difference in ABO/Rh blood group distribution in individuals with PCOS compared to the normal population. The relation between ABO blood groups and the developing of various diseases has not been fully elucidated. On the surface of epithelial cells, including the skin, bronchopulmonary, vaginal tract, and gastrointestinal cells, exist blood types carbohydrate antigens. [ 24 ] The ABO blood groups gene is located on chromosome 9q34 and encoding glycosyltransferases. The enzymatic activity of ABO glycosyltransferases modulates cellular membrane transmission, intercellular adhesion, and the immune response to the host. [ 14 , 15 ] Possible reasons for disease development include disorder of the ABO glycosyltransferases\u2019 enzymatic activity. ABO blood group antigens alter the inflammatory state of the host, which may affect the onset of diseases. [ 16 ]  A relationship has been determined between hyperandrogenism and clinical factors such as insulin resistance and obesity in PCOS. [ 25 ] In this study, we also assessed the association between ABO/Rh blood groups and clinical and biochemical characteristics. In this study, baseline clinical features of individuals with PCOS were found to be similar according to ABO/Rh blood group distribution.  This study had some limitations as it was retrospective. The number of patients was relatively limited. In the retrospective study, the patient group was heterogeneous. Some patient data were not available.    5. Conclusion  The basal clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with PCOS were evaluated. The blood group distributions of patients with PCOS were compared with that of healthy individuals, and it was determined that ABO/Rh blood groups were not a risk factor for PCOS. This study contributes to the literature as it is the first study to examine the relationship between PCOS and ABO/Rh blood groups. It has been defined that the blood group is a risk factor in some cancers, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases. Studies involving more patients are needed to clarify the results of this study. A better definition of PCOS pathogenesis and risk factors will play a crucial role in the development of future therapies for the relief of PCOS symptoms. In addition, translational studies examining the expression of ABO/Rh blood group antigens in ovarian tissue in individuals with PCOS are needed to fully understand the pathogenesis.
