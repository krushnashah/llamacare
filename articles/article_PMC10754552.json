    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is prevalent among women of reproductive age and is characterized by endocrine and metabolic abnormalities. [ 1 , 2 ] It is distinguished by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, with an incidence of approximately 18% in women of reproductive age. [ 1 , 2 ] PCOS not only causes menstrual irregularities, ovulatory disorders, hirsutism, and acne, but also has the potential to induce atypical endometrial hyperplasia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. [ 3 , 4 ] There is a close association between hypothyroidism and PCOS, with patients with PCOS often presenting with abnormal thyroid hormone secretion. [ 5 ] Additionally, patients with PCOS frequently exhibit elevated levels of thyrotropin (TSH), leading to glycolipid metabolism disorders, insulin resistance, and sexual dysfunction. Decreased estradiol levels and impaired thyroid function have been associated with PCOS. [ 6 ]  In recent years, the relationship between PCOS and diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases has gained increasing attention. [ 7 \u2013 9 ] PCOS not only affects the reproductive function, but also contributes to diabetes, glycolipid metabolism disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other related metabolic disruptions. [ 7 \u2013 10 ] Based on the comprehensive findings of previous research, it is plausible to consider a correlation between TSH levels in patients with PCOS and sex hormones, glucose-lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between TSH levels and glycolipid metabolism in patients with PCOS. By assessing TSH and relevant indicators and implementing appropriate interventions, we aimed to reduce the occurrence of complications in patients with PCOS and provide new insights for correcting glycolipid metabolism disorders in clinical practice.    2. Materials and methods   2.1. Study participants  The medical records of 105 patients with PCOS from the Gynecology Department of Suzhou Hospital of Anhui Medical University from January 2021 to November 2022 were selected for this retrospective study. All patients were administered drug-induced ovulation treatment, ovulation status was monitored, and patients were divided into 2 groups according to ovulation status. There were 67 and 38 patients in the ovulation and non-ovulation groups, respectively. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosis of PCOS based on the revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria [ 11 ] ; (2) women of reproductive age: 18 to 49 years [ 12 ] ; and (3) informed consent from patients and their families. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) women who were pregnant or had a history of ovarian surgery; (2) patients who had undergone treatment for PCOS and thyroid-related diseases within the past 6 months; and (3) those with severe cardiac or pulmonary impairment or hepatic dysfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Suzhou Hospital of Anhui Medical University.    2.2. Drug-induced ovulation therapy  Clomiphene citrate tablets (50\u2009mg) or letrozole tablets (2.5\u2009mg) were administered once a day for 5 days from the 3rd to 5th day of the menstrual cycle. After 6 days, the follicles were monitored daily. If there was no dominant follicle, the medication was continued according to the dose until the 10th day. When a follicle diameter of >18\u2009mm was found, 5000 units of chorionic gonadotropin were injected intramuscularly. After 10 days of treatment, if no dominant follicle (diameter\u2005\u2265\u200514\u2009mm) was detected, drug-induced ovulation was considered to have failed and the patient was classified into the non-ovulation group. Patients were classified into the ovulation group if follicle discharge was detected during this period.    2.3. Observation indicators  Venous blood (5\u2009mL) was collected on the day after admission from the non-ovulation group and on the day of physical examination from the ovulation group. Several indicators were measured using a 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), including TSH, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and transferrin (TF).    2.4. Statistical analysis  SPSS 21.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. Since all measurement data in this study were subject to normal distribution, measurement data were represented by mean\u2005\u00b1\u2005standard deviation and compared by t -test. The count data were represented by n (%) and compared by \u03c7 2 test. Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the correlations between serum TSH levels and various indices of glycolipid metabolism. P <\u2005.05 was considered to be statistically significant.     3. Results   3.1. Comparison of general data between the 2 groups  In this study, the non-ovulation group comprised 38 patients and the ovulation group, 67 patients. General information was collected, including age, height, weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, and waist-to-hip ratio. There were no significant differences in age, height, or waist-to-hip ratio between the non-ovulation and ovulation groups ( P >\u2005.05). However, compared with the ovulation group, body weight, BMI, waistline, and hipline in the non-ovulation group were significantly higher ( P <\u2005.05), as shown in Table 1 .

Comparison of TSH level and glycolipid metabolism indexes between the 2 groups  TSH levels and glycolipid metabolism indices, such as FPG, glycosylated hemoglobin, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG levels, were recorded between the 2 groups. The TSH level in the non-ovulation group was 2.10\u2005\u00b1\u20050.89 mIU/L, which was significantly lower than that of 3.43\u2005\u00b1\u20051.24 mIU/L in the ovulation group ( P <\u2005.05). In addition, there were no significant difference in HbAlc, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels between the non-ovulation and ovulation groups ( P >\u2005.05). However, compared with the ovulation group, the levels of FPG, TC, and TG in the non-ovulation group were significantly higher ( P <\u2005.05), as shown in Table 2 .

Comparison of nutritional status between the 2 groups  Indicators reflecting the nutritional status of patients include serum ALB, PA, and TF levels. The serum ALB level in the non-ovulation group was 50.39\u2005\u00b1\u20055.59\u2009g/L, which was significantly higher than that of 43.71\u2005\u00b1\u20056.54\u2009g/L in the ovulation group ( P <\u2005.05). Furthermore, the levels of PA and TF in the non-ovulation group were significantly higher than those in the ovulation group ( P <\u2005.05), as shown in Table 3 .

Correlation analysis between TSH levels and each index in the non-ovulation group  According to previous findings, the TSH level in the non-ovulation group was significantly lower than that in the ovulation group but weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, FPG, TC, TG, ALB, PA, and TF were significantly higher. Correlation analysis showed that TSH levels in the non-ovulation group were negatively correlated with weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, waist-hip ratio, FPG, ALB, PA, and TF ( P <\u2005.05) but not with TC and TG ( P >\u2005.05), as shown in Table 4 .

Discussion  TSH is the main index of thyroid function and is of great significance in the detection of thyroid function. [ 13 , 14 ] However, in PCOS, the ligand specifically binds to cell membranes or intracellular receptors. After the ligand binds to the receptor, a series of proteins in the cell gradually regulate the activity of downstream proteins, gradually amplifying and transmitting signals from the outside. [ 15 ] Eventually, a series of complex cellular reactions occur, in which upstream proteins regulate downstream proteins by adding or removing phosphate groups to change the spatial conformation of downstream proteins. [ 15 ] This undesirable signaling pathway stimulation may lead to changes in TSH expression in the body, which, in turn, may become a risk factor for PCOS. [ 16 ]  Many patients with thyroid dysfunction have mental health problems, which are not only related to the endocrine system itself but also to many inflammatory reactions in the body, which indirectly constitute the risk factors for PCOS. [ 17 ] Because many metabolites of inflammatory reactions in the body can act on signaling pathways related to the function of the metabolic system of the human body, the metabolic problems caused by inflammation may be a defensive response of the body to stimulation. [ 18 ] Usually, such a reaction is beneficial for the body, but there are also harmful situations such as attacking the body\u2019s own tissue and inflammation of the transparent tissue. [ 19 ] Long-term inflammatory stimulation is an independent risk factor for metabolic disorders. Studies have revealed the involvement of many cellular signaling pathways in this process, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, TGF-\u03b2, and B cell receptor signaling pathways, which can jointly regulate the occurrence of inflammation through synergistic or enhanced action mode. [ 20 ] These signaling pathways also regulate the activation and inactivation of metabolism-related genes.  A low TSH level can be regarded as an independent risk factor for PCOS. [ 21 ] However, with recent economic development and lifestyle changes, low TSH levels have become more common in patients with PCOS. In this study, the TSH in the non-ovulation group (2.10\u2005\u00b1\u20050.89 mIU/L) was significantly lower than that in the ovulation group (3.43\u2005\u00b1\u20051.24 mIU/L), suggesting that a deficiency of TSH in patients with PCOS is worrying, and should be paid more attention. Body weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, and waist-hip ratio were higher in the non-ovulation group than in the ovulation group. Correlation analysis showed that TSH levels were negatively correlated with body weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, and waist-to-hip ratio. It is speculated that the above findings may be due to the inhibition of the low expression of TSH on the regulation of adipose differentiation and maturation, resulting in a significant enhancement of adipocyte differentiation and maturation and a decrease in the basic metabolism of adipocytes. This results in an increase in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-hip ratio, and a decrease in TSH concentration, forming a vicious circle.  TSH reflects the sensitivity of the body to insulin, participates in the anti-inflammatory process of the adipose tissue, enhances insulin sensitivity, and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. [ 14 ] Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism have been suggested as one of the reasons for the decrease in serum TSH levels in patients with PCOS. A low serum TSH level indicates severely abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with PCOS, including hyperinsulinemia caused by abnormal insulin secretion. [ 22 ] Meanwhile, compensatory hyperinsulinemia promotes adipocyte dysfunction and abnormal aggregation. Hyperinsulinemia and adipose tissue dysfunction, as well as the subsequent abnormal expression and secretion of adipocytic cytokines such as TSH, lead to endocrine disorders in the reproductive system of PCOS patients, menstrual disorders, abnormal follicular development, and ultimately non-ovulation infertility. [ 23 ] However, high levels of total testosterone cause a large number of small follicles to enter the follicular selection stage, inhibit the normal development and maturation of small follicles, and prevent the formation of dominant follicles, resulting in non-ovulation infertility in patients with PCOS. [ 24 ] At the same time, a decrease in progesterone content leads to negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamus, which leads to the continuous release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, resulting in an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and an increase in androstenedione secreted by follicular membrane cells, affecting the intrauterine microenvironment and leading to infertility. [ 25 ] Because the levels of serum TSH and total testosterone in infertile patients with PCOS can reflect the endocrine status to some extent, low expression of TSH or high expression of total testosterone indicates that the body is in an abnormal state of glucose and lipid metabolism, which is characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and fat dysfunction. [ 26 ] At this time, the reproductive system is dysfunctional, hormone levels are abnormal, and follicular dysplasia occurs, resulting in a low success rate of drug-induced ovulation. The clinical outcomes of pregnant women can be predicted by observing their serum TSH and total testosterone levels. [ 27 ]  The limitations of this study are as follows: first, the small sample size; second, as a retrospective analysis, there may have been some information and selection bias in the patient data, and the results of the study need to be confirmed by prospective trials; and third, this was a single-center study that focused only on a subset of the Chinese population.    5. Conclusion  In conclusion, this study shows that TSH levels may be associated with weight, BMI, waistline, hipline, waist-hip ratio, FPG, ALB, PA, and TF in patients with PCOS. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and multicenter data are required to verify our findings.    Author contributions  Conceptualization: Zhongyu Chen, Shui Jing, Yanyan Sun.
