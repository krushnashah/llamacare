    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy characterized by chronic oligo\u2010anovulation, polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism (Goodarzi et\u00a0al. 2011 ). PCOS affects from 6% to 20% of women worldwide, depending on the population studied and diagnostic criteria applied (Azziz et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Broekmans et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Boyle et\u00a0al. 2012 ). Hence, it is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive\u2010aged women. Insulin resistance (IR) and concomitant compensatory hyperinsulinemia drive the phenotypic features of PCOS and thus are essential characteristics of the syndrome (Goodarzi et\u00a0al. 2011 ). PCOS involves both intrinsic syndrome\u2010specific IR and extrinsic body mass index (BMI)\u2010related IR in overweight and obese women (Stepto et\u00a0al. 2013 ). Overweight (25\u00a0kg/m 2 \u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0kg/m 2 ) and obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg/m 2 ) affect over 50% of women with PCOS and exacerbate both reproductive abnormalities and metabolic dysfunction (Azziz et\u00a0al. 2009 ).  Metabolic dysfunction in women with PCOS leads to exaggerated risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases with aging (The Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010Sponsored 3rd PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2012 ). Peak O 2 uptake ( V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) reflects exercise capacity, which is an independent predictor of cardiovascular and all\u2010cause mortality in women (Mora et\u00a0al. 2003 ). Overweight and obese women with PCOS have reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak compared to age\u2010 and BMI\u2010matched healthy women (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ). However, if exhibiting a similar IR profile, overweight and obese women with PCOS have been reported to have similar V \u02d9 O 2 peak to that of age\u2010 and weight\u2010matched healthy women (Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ). Thus, the magnitude of IR has been suggested to be the leading pathophysiological feature affecting V \u02d9 O 2 peak in overweight and obese women with PCOS (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ).   V \u02d9 O 2 is a product of cardiac output (CO) and systemic arteriovenous O 2 difference (C(a\u2010v)O 2 ). In an integrated manner, V \u02d9 O 2 consists of the O 2 transport system delivering O 2 from the air to the muscle mitochondria and the metabolic system utilizing the delivered O 2 to generate energy. Hence, V \u02d9 O 2 peak may be affected by limitations of alveolar gas exchange, Hb concentration, cardiac function, muscle blood flow, muscle O 2 extraction, and muscle O 2 utilization (Wagner 2000 ). However, little is known about mechanisms primarily determining V \u02d9 O 2 peak in PCOS. Both diastolic (Yarali et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Orio et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ) and systolic (Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ) dysfunction, associated with IR (Yarali et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Orio et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ), as well as normal cardiac function (Tekin et\u00a0al. 2009 ; Rees et\u00a0al. 2014 ) have been reported in women with PCOS at rest in case\u2013control echocardiographic studies. Thus, cardiac dysfunction and concomitantly impaired exercise CO are potential contributors to reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak in PCOS. Peripheral O 2 delivery and utilization may also be affected in PCOS. Women with PCOS exhibit endothelial dysfunction manifested as impaired nitric oxide (NO)\u2010mediated vasodilation (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013a , b ), which can result in impaired muscle blood flow during exercise (Maxwell et\u00a0al. 1998 ). For the present, an association between endothelial dysfunction and IR in PCOS is unresolved (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013a ). Defects in skeletal muscle insulin signaling pathways (Dunaif et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Corbould et\u00a0al. 2005 ) and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (Skov et\u00a0al. 2007 ) have also been observed in women with PCOS and pronounced IR, potentially reducing responsiveness to glucose and O 2 utilization within skeletal muscles. However, intact primary function of skeletal muscle mitochondria has also been reported in PCOS (Eriksen et\u00a0al. 2011 ; Rab\u00f8l et\u00a0al. 2011 ).  Characterizing and understanding cardiorespiratory and vascular responses to exercise in women with PCOS is important as lifestyle management, including regular exercise and diet, is the first\u2010line strategy in pursuing health outcomes (e.g., improved ovulation and menstrual cycle regulation, reduced weight and IR) in PCOS (Harrison et\u00a0al. 2011 ). Nevertheless, the responses of cardiac function and C(a\u2010v)O 2 to exercise in women with PCOS have not yet been studied. In this study, we hypothesized that overweight and obese PCOS women would have lower V \u02d9 O 2 peak than control women matched for age, anthropometry, and leisure\u2010time physical activity (LTPA). The purpose of the study was to examine systemic O 2 delivery (particularly cardiac function) and C(a\u2010v)O 2 during incremental exercise and their contributions to the hypothetically reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak of overweight and obese PCOS women.    Materials and Methods   Subjects  Thirty female volunteers participated in this study. Fifteen subjects were overweight or obese PCOS women, while 15 subjects were overweight or obese control women. The groups were matched for age, anthropometry, and self\u2010reported LTPA. All subjects were Finns and thus had a North European background. PCOS women achieved the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine criteria for PCOS diagnosis (i.e., Rotterdam criteria) (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM\u2010Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004 ): All showed oligo\u2010 or anovulation, all showed polycystic ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound, and four had clinical (hirsutism) and/or biochemical (serum testosterone\u00a0>\u00a02.0\u00a0nmol/L) hyperandrogenism. PCOS women were recruited from the patient population of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. Controls were regularly menstruating (i.e., a menstrual period occurring every 23\u201332\u00a0days [Cole et\u00a0al. 2009 ]), showed no clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and were free of medication. Controls were mainly recruited from the employees and the students of University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. The exclusion criteria of the study were an age of <18 or >40\u00a0years, BMI of <25 or >40\u00a0kg/m 2 , pregnancy, androgen\u2010secreting tumors, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, anemia, diabetes, hypertension, antiandrogen medication, \u03b2 \u2010blocker medication, medication influencing glucose homeostasis, use of oral contraceptives, substance abuse, physical disability, smoking, and other cardiovascular, endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, or respiratory diseases that could have affected any outcome of interest.    Ethical approval  Every subject gave written informed consent to participate in this study, which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Helsinki, Finland.    Study protocol  The subjects visited the laboratory twice. Both visits were preceded by abstinence from alcohol for at least 24\u00a0h and physical exercise for at least 12\u00a0h. At the first visit, the subjects reported to the laboratory 2\u20133\u00a0h after a meal. The first visit consisted of pre\u2010exercise measurements and a cardiorespiratory exercise test. The subjects completed a preliminary questionnaire concerning their personal health and medical history. LTPA was obtained from a single question: \u201cIf you think about your past 3\u00a0months and physical activity sessions lasting more than 20\u00a0min in all settings (e.g., commutation, walking a dog, recreation, sport), how many times a week and how long at a time have you engaged in physical activity?\u201d The question meets the general recommendations (i.e., frequency, duration, all settings) for enquiring LTPA (van Poppel et\u00a0al. 2010 ). The subjects\u2019 height and waist and hip circumferences were measured, and body composition was determined by the bioimpedance method (InBody 720, Biospace Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea). Capillary blood was drawn from a fingertip to analyze Hb concentration by a blood gas analyzer (ABL725, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Pre\u2010exercise measurements at rest also included a 12\u2010lead ECG, blood pressure, and flow\u2010volume spirometry (Medikro Spiro 2000, Medikro Oy, Kuopio, Finland). In addition, a physician examined the subjects to ensure their suitability for the cardiorespiratory exercise test, which was also performed at the first visit (see below).  The second visit followed overnight fasting. Fasting venous blood was drawn for measurements of lipid profile (i.e., HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol and triglycerides), plasma glucose, and serum insulin. Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin were determined by the hexokinase method and the immunochemiluminometric assay, respectively. Homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA\u2010IR) was calculated by the following formula (Matthews et\u00a0al. 1985 ): HOMA\u2010IR\u00a0=\u00a0[fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[fasting serum insulin ( \u03bc U/mL)]/22.5.  Serum testosterone and sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations of PCOS women were not determined separately for this study but as part of the patients\u2019 clinical care by the mass spectrometry assay and the immunochemiluminometric assay, respectively. Free androgen index was calculated as follows: Free androgen index\u00a0=\u00a0[serum testosterone (nmol/L)]/[serum SHBG (nmol/L)]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100.    Cardiorespiratory exercise test  The cardiorespiratory exercise test was performed on a mechanically braked cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 839E, Monark Exercise AB, Vansbro, Sweden). The test began with 5\u2010min seated rest while the subjects sat relaxed on the ergometer, followed by 5\u2010min baseline unloaded cycling. The step incremental protocol (30\u00a0W/3\u00a0min) was then initiated with a work rate of 30\u00a0W, and the subjects continued exercising until volitional fatigue. The subjects were verbally encouraged to maximal exertion.  Breath\u2010by\u2010breath ventilation was measured by a low\u2010resistance turbine (Triple V, Jaeger Mijnhardt, Bunnik, The Netherlands) to determine inspiratory and expiratory volumes and flow during the exercise test. Prior to each test, the turbine was calibrated using a syringe of 3.00\u00a0L volume (Hans Rudolph, Inc., Kansas City, MO). Inspired and expired gases were sampled continuously at mouth and analyzed for concentrations of O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and Ar by mass spectrometry (AMIS 2000, Innovision A/S, Odense, Denmark) after calibration with precision\u2010analyzed gas mixtures. Breath\u2010by\u2010breath respiratory data were collected as raw data. The raw data were transferred to a computer, which determined gas delays for each breath to align concentrations with volume data and to build a profile of each breath. Breath\u2010by\u2010breath alveolar gas exchange was then calculated with the AMIS algorithms, and the data were interpolated to obtain second\u2010by\u2010second values. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was calculated as a quotient of CO 2 output and pulmonary O 2 uptake ( V \u02d9 O 2 ) (Edvardsen et\u00a0al. 2014 ). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was obtained using the Borg scale (6\u201320) at the end of each work rate.  Fingertip pulse oximetry (Nonin 9600, Nonin Medical, Inc., Plymouth, MA) was used to monitor arterial O 2 saturation (SpO 2 ). Arterial O 2 content (CaO 2 ) was calculated as the product of SpO 2 , Hb concentration, and the physiological O 2 binding coefficient of Hb (1.34\u00a0mL/g): CaO 2 =\u00a0SpO 2 \u00d7\u00a0Hb concentration\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.34.  Heart rate (HR) and the electrical activity of the heart were continuously monitored by ECG (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom). Cardiac function was continuously evaluated by an impedance cardiograph device (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical, Paris, France). This method has been described in detail elsewhere (Charloux et\u00a0al. 2000 ); briefly, the method uses changes in transthoracic impedance during cardiac ejection to calculate stroke volume (SV), which is multiplied by HR to provide an estimate of CO. The method has been found valid and reliable at rest and during low\u2010to\u2010maximal intensity exercise in overweight and obese individuals (Charloux et\u00a0al. 2000 ; Richard et\u00a0al. 2001 ); when CO has been measured by the PhysioFlow and the direct Fick method during maximal incremental exercise, a correlation coefficient of r =  0.94 between the two methods has been observed (Richard et\u00a0al. 2001 ). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured automatically (Tango+, SunTech Medical, Morrisville, NC) from the brachial artery at seated rest and at the end of each work rate.  Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated by the standard equation: MAP\u00a0=\u00a0(systolic blood pressure\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 diastolic blood pressure)/3. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was calculated according to Darcy's law: SVR\u00a0=\u00a0(MAP\u00a0\u2212\u00a0central venous pressure)/CO, where central venous pressure was assumed to be 0\u00a0mmHg (Mortensen et\u00a0al. 2005 ). Cardiac power output (CPO) at peak exercise was calculated from the values of CO and MAP at peak exercise (Cooke et\u00a0al. 1998 ): CPO\u00a0=\u00a0CO\u00a0\u00d7MAP\u00a0\u00d7 K , where K is a conversion factor (2.22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 ) into watts. Systemic C(a\u2010v)O 2 was derived using the Fick equation: C(a\u2010v)O 2 = V \u02d9 O 2 /CO.    Statistical analysis  Data are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD). The mean values of the last 30\u00a0sec at seated rest, during unloaded cycling, at each work rate, and at peak exercise were chosen for further analyses. Peak O 2 uptake ( V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) was determined as the highest value of a 60\u2010sec moving averaging interval.  The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used to check for normality and data were log transformed when appropriate. A one\u2010way ANOVA was used to compare baseline characteristics, cardiovascular function at seated rest, metabolic profile, cardiovascular risk factors, and CPO between PCOS women and controls. A two\u2010way repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate whether there were differences in responses to the cardiorespiratory exercise test between PCOS women and controls: Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Exercise interactions were evaluated, while Group (i.e., PCOS women vs. controls) was a between\u2010subjects factor, and Exercise (i.e., unloaded cycling [0W], work rates accomplished by each subject [30\u00a0W, 60\u00a0W, 90\u00a0W, 120\u00a0W], peak exercise) was a within\u2010subject factor. In a separate analysis, we used relative intensities (i.e., % of V \u02d9 O 2 peak during unloaded cycling [0\u00a0W], 25% of V \u02d9 O 2 peak , 50% of V \u02d9 O 2 peak , 75% of V \u02d9 O 2 peak , 100% of V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) as a within\u2010subject factor. Multivariate ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was performed to identify the differences in the exercise responses between PCOS women and controls. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for correlation analyses.  The response of CO to incremental exercise was determined as follows: The means of CO and V \u02d9 O 2 at six data points (i.e., unloaded cycling [0\u00a0W], 30\u00a0W, 60\u00a0W, 90\u00a0W, 120\u00a0W, peak exercise) were separately calculated for PCOS women and controls, after which the \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope for both subject groups was determined by performing a linear regression of CO over V \u02d9 O 2 at the six data points. Further comparison of the \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slopes (i.e., the \u03b2 coefficients) between PCOS women and controls was made by using the method of dummy variables and interaction terms (Lunt 2015 ): A dummy variable called Syndrome was first created so that it took the value 0 for controls and 1 for PCOS women. To test whether PCOS affected the linear regression of CO over V \u02d9 O 2 , an interaction term Syndrome\u00a0\u00d7 V \u02d9 O 2 was created and then included in an additional multiple linear regression model, where CO was the outcome, and Syndrome, V \u02d9 O 2 , and Syndrome\u00a0\u00d7 V \u02d9 O 2 were the predictors. Eventually, the contribution of Syndrome\u00a0\u00d7 V \u02d9 O 2 to the model indicated whether the \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slopes differed between PCOS women and controls.  To avoid ignoring any differences in body size and composition between PCOS women and controls, we scaled V \u02d9 O 2 (Batterham et\u00a0al. 1999 ; Krachler et\u00a0al. 2015 ) as well as SV, CO, and CPO (Whalley et\u00a0al. 2004 ) relative to fat\u2010free mass (FFM), whereas SVR was multiplied by FFM. The scaled cardiovascular variables were referred as indices: SV i , CO i , CPO i , SVR i , respectively.  Statistical significance was set at a P value of <0.05. The results were computed with PASW Statistics 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY).     Results   Descriptive characteristics of the subjects  Baseline characteristics, cardiovascular function at seated rest, metabolic profile, and cardiovascular risk factors of the subjects are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . PCOS women and controls had similar Hb concentrations and flow\u2010volume spirometry results with no defects. No differences between the groups were observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, HR, SV, and SV i at rest. At rest, PCOS women had higher CO, but similar CO i in comparison with controls. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA\u2010IR, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were similar between the groups. PCOS women had lower HDL cholesterol than controls. In PCOS women, serum testosterone was 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0nmol/L, serum SHBG was 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0nmol/L, and free androgen index was 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0.

Table 3 details peak work rates as well as respiratory and cardiovascular responses at peak exercise. A significant Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Exercise interaction was observed for V \u02d9 O 2 ( P =  0.014; Fig. 1 A). When scaled to FFM, peak work rate and V \u02d9 O 2 peak were lower in PCOS women than in controls, while the differences in absolute values were not significant. At peak exercise, RER (1.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 vs. 1.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, P =  0.845) and RPE (20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 vs. 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01, P =  0.346) were similar between PCOS women and controls, respectively, indicating that both groups similarly made their maximal effort during the exercise test.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd    No difference between PCOS women and controls were observed for ventilation at peak exercise. SpO 2 and CaO 2 were also similarly maintained in the groups throughout the exercise test.  Similar profiles of HR, SV i , CO i , MAP, and SVR i as a function of work rate, and similar profiles of HR, SV i , and CO i as a function of relative intensity (% of V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) were seen in PCOS women and controls throughout the exercise: Significant Group\u00d7Exercise interactions in these analyses were not observed. In addition, similar HR, SV, SV i , CO, CO i , systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, MAP, SVR, SVR i , CPO, and CPO i were detected in the groups at peak exercise.  Hyperbolic responses of C(a\u2010v)O 2 to incremental exercise were seen in PCOS women and controls (Figs. 1 H and 2 D). Group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Exercise interactions for C(a\u2010v)O 2 ( P =  0.075 when examining C(a\u2010v)O 2 as a function of work rate, and P =  0.052 when examining C(a\u2010v)O 2 as a function of % of V \u02d9 O 2 peak ; Figs. 1 H and 2 D) suggested there might be true group effects at single work rates or relative intensities regarding C(a\u2010v)O 2 . Consequently, PCOS women had lower C(a\u2010v)O 2 at peak exercise than controls (Figs. 1 H and 2 D, Table 3 ). Additionally, the \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope was steeper in PCOS women when compared to controls ( \u03b2 =\u00a05.84 vs. \u03b2 =\u00a05.21, respectively, P =  0.004; Fig. 3 ).

White circles (\u25cb)\u00a0= PCOS women ( n =  15), black circles (\u25cf)\u00a0=\u00a0controls ( n =  15). The six data points for both PCOS women and controls indicate the group means of CO and V \u02d9 O 2 during unloaded cycling (0\u00a0W), at work rates of 30\u00a0W, 60\u00a0W, 90\u00a0W, and 120\u00a0W, and at peak exercise. The \u2206 CO /\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slopes for both groups have been determined by performing a linear regression of CO over V \u02d9 O 2 at the six data points. *The P value refers to the significantly different \u2206 CO /\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slopes between PCOS women ( \u03b2 =\u00a05.84) and controls ( \u03b2 =\u00a05.21).     In all subjects, an inverse correlation between V \u02d9 O 2 peak (mL/min/kg FFM) and HOMA\u2010IR was observed, but it did not reach statistical significance ( r =  \u22120.29, P =  0.066). Instead, when V \u02d9 O 2 peak was scaled relative to body weight, there was a significant correlation between V \u02d9 O 2 peak and HOMA\u2010IR in all subjects ( r =  \u22120.34, P =  0.037). When the correlation between V \u02d9 O 2 peak (mL/min/kg FFM) and HOMA\u2010IR was examined separately in PCOS women and controls, no significant correlation cofficients were observed: r =  \u22120.29 ( P =  0.155) in PCOS women and r =  \u22120.19 ( P =  0.247) in controls.     Discussion  According to our hypothesis, reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak was observed in overweight and obese women with PCOS when compared to that of age\u2010, anthropometry\u2010, and LTPA\u2010matched controls. To explain this, two novel findings were made. First, reduced C(a\u2010v)O 2 at peak exercise and a steeper \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope in PCOS women reflected an altered response to incremental exercise in comparison with controls. Second, PCOS women and controls attained similar cardiac function at peak exercise, while CaO 2 was similarly maintained in the groups throughout the exercise. These findings in the relatively healthy overweight and obese women indicate that PCOS per se is associated with alterations in peripheral adjustments to\u00a0exercise rather than with limitations of systemic O 2 delivery.   Altered cardiorespiratory response to exercise in PCOS women: reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak , reduced C(a\u2010v)O 2 at peak exercise, steeper \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope  We observed lower V \u02d9 O 2 peak in PCOS women than in controls, while there was no significant difference in HOMA\u2010IR between the groups. Previously, reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak in overweight and obese women with PCOS has been reported when compared to age\u2010 and BMI\u2010matched healthy women (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ), but if exhibiting a similar IR profile, obese women with PCOS have been found to have similar V \u02d9 O 2 peak to that of age\u2010 and weight\u2010matched healthy women (Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ). In addition, an inverse association between V \u02d9 O 2 peak and HOMA\u2010IR has been reported in women with PCOS (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ) and in a pooled population including obese women with and without PCOS (Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ). Hence, it has been hypothesized that IR would be significantly linked to V \u02d9 O 2 peak in overweight and obese women with PCOS (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ). However, V \u02d9 O 2 peak has been scaled to body weight in the two studies (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ), which ignores body composition and thus may introduce a bias against overweight and obese women (Krachler et\u00a0al. 2015 ) as discussed later. An inverse association between FFM\u2010adjusted V \u02d9 O 2 peak (mL/min/kg FFM) and HOMA\u2010IR did not reach statistical significance in our study. Instead, when V \u02d9 O 2 peak was scaled to body weight, the association between V \u02d9 O 2 peak and HOMA\u2010IR in all subjects turned out significant. Taken together, it seems that IR is likely linked to the reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak in overweight and obese women with PCOS but the link becomes weaker when the confounding effect of adipose tissue is taken into account. This suggests that other pathophysiological features, not related to IR, also have a significant impact on V \u02d9 O 2 peak in women with PCOS.  In addition to the reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak , we observed both reduced C(a\u2010v)O 2 at peak exercise and a steeper \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope in PCOS women when compared to controls. C(a\u2010v)O 2 also tended to be lower in PCOS women than in controls throughout the exercise until reaching the significant difference at peak exercise (Figs. 1 H and 2 D). These findings indicate that PCOS women exhibited a pronounced response of CO to increasing O 2 demand from the very beginning of incremental exercise to compensate for alterations in peripheral adjustments to exercise.  We hypothesize that following alterations regarding peripheral O 2 delivery and utilization may be associated with the reduced peak C(a\u2010v)O 2 and the steeper \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope in PCOS women. First, endothelial dysfunction, which is an intrinsic feature of PCOS (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013a ), is associated with reduced exercise capacity in women (Patel et\u00a0al. 2005 ). Endothelial dysfunction may impair the appropriate exercise\u2010induced hyperemia in active muscles due to reduced bioavailability of NO (Maxwell et\u00a0al. 1998 ), and in fact, particularly NO\u2010mediated microvascular vasodilator dysfunction has recently been observed in PCOS (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013b ). In addition, exercise training has been demonstrated to enhance NO\u2010mediated endothelial function with a parallel improvement in V \u02d9 O 2 peak in obese women with PCOS (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013b ). For the present, it is unresolved whether endothelial dysfunction is associated with IR in PCOS (Sprung et\u00a0al. 2013a ). We did not observe differences in exercise MAP or SVR i between PCOS women and controls in our current study. This suggests vascular conductance was not limited at the whole\u2010body level for PCOS women. However, we cannot draw conclusions concerning exercise\u2010induced redistribution of blood flow between active muscles and less active regions such as splanchnic circulation, because local active muscle blood flow differs considerably from systemically observed circulatory responses during incremental exercise (Murias et\u00a0al. 2013 ). Second, in conditions in which there is a skeletal muscle oxidative defect, such as in mitochondrial myopathies, the findings of reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak , reduced peak C(a\u2010v)O 2 , and a pronounced \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope resemble our findings in PCOS women (Taivassalo et\u00a0al. 2003 ). Defects in skeletal muscle insulin signaling pathways (Dunaif et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Corbould et\u00a0al. 2005 ) and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (Skov et\u00a0al. 2007 ) have been observed in women with PCOS and pronounced IR, potentially reducing responsiveness to glucose and O 2 utilization within skeletal muscles. However, primary function of skeletal muscle mitochondria has also been reported to be intact in PCOS (Eriksen et\u00a0al. 2011 ; Rab\u00f8l et\u00a0al. 2011 ). Hence, it is unclear whether defects in mitochondrial function could reduce O 2 utilization and thus peak C(a\u2010v)O 2 in PCOS women in this study.    PCOS per se does not limit systemic O 2 delivery during exercise  SpO 2 and CaO 2 were similarly maintained in PCOS women and controls throughout incremental exercise, suggesting that alveolar gas exchange set no limitation to systemic O 2 delivery. In addition, after exhibiting the pronounced response of CO to increasing O 2 demand, PCOS women attained similar CO and CO i at peak exercise in comparison with controls. We also calculated CPO (and CPO i ), which is an index of cardiac reserve and conveys the hydraulic power of the heart by relating changes in flow and afterload (Cooke et\u00a0al. 1998 ): No differences between PCOS women and controls were observed for CPO and CPO i at peak exercise. Thus, while cardiac function has its vital role in the integrated system responding for O 2 transport (Wagner 2000 ), total blood flow and cardiovascular system's ability to generate an appropriate response to increasing O 2 demand were not further diminished in PCOS women. In conclusion, PCOS per se did not contribute to limitations of systemic O 2 delivery during exercise.  At rest before incremental exercise, higher CO but similar CO i were measured in PCOS women when compared to controls. The difference in absolute CO at rest was thus partly due to slight but nonsignificant differences in anthropometry but also due to a nonsignificantly higher mean of resting HR in PCOS women. Previous studies have reported both diastolic (Yarali et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Orio et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ) and systolic (Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ) dysfunction as well as normal cardiac function (Tekin et\u00a0al. 2009 ; Rees et\u00a0al. 2014 ) in women with PCOS at rest in case\u2013control echocardiographic studies. There may be an inverse association between cardiac function and the magnitude of IR in PCOS as associations between cardiac dysfunction and IR have been observed in women with PCOS (Yarali et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Orio et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Kosmala et\u00a0al. 2008 ). In addition, diastolic dysfunction was recently found to be associated with IR in overweight and obese women but PCOS itself did not contribute to the dysfunction (Rees et\u00a0al. 2014 ). Thus, our finding of similar cardiac function at peak exercise in PCOS women and controls might be due to rather similar HOMA\u2010IR in the groups, albeit we did not find significant associations between cardiac function and HOMA\u2010IR (data not shown).    Methodological considerations, strengths, and limitations  The contribution of fat mass to O 2 consumption is negligible and independent of V \u02d9 O 2 peak (Goran et\u00a0al. 2000 ). Instead, absolute V \u02d9 O 2 peak (L/min) follows a linear function of FFM (Batterham et\u00a0al. 1999 ; Krachler et\u00a0al. 2015 ). Scaling V \u02d9 O 2 peak to FFM during cycling exercise was recently demonstrated to introduce a much smaller bias against obese women than quantifying V \u02d9 O 2 peak with more traditional methods (i.e., L/min, or mL/min/kg body weight) (Krachler et\u00a0al. 2015 ), although cycling is a nonweight\u2010bearing exercise mode. Thus, in our current study involving overweight and obese women, we scaled V \u02d9 O 2 to FFM to avoid ignoring any differences in body size and composition between PCOS women and controls.  The strengths of this study included matching the subject groups for age, anthropometry, and LTPA. Moreover, compared to invasive alternatives, the noninvasive methods used to monitor SpO 2 and cardiac function were probably more feasible to the subjects of this study. This is relevant as a confidence in the ability to maintain exercise might be impaired in PCOS due to diminished mental health often related to the syndrome (Banting et\u00a0al. 2014 ). However, PCOS women and controls similarly made their maximal effort during the exercise test according to RER and RPE data (Edvardsen et\u00a0al. 2014 ), thus indicating no particular signs of behavior affecting their exercise performance.  One limitation of this study was the method used to assess IR; using an oral glucose tolerance test or a euglycemic\u2013hyperinsulinemic clamp technique might have provided a more in\u2010depth assessment of insulin sensitivity. It is also notable that the hormonal profile of the subjects was not determined separately for this study because previous studies had not found consistent associations between hormonal profile and V \u02d9 O 2 peak (Orio et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Thomson et\u00a0al. 2009 ) or hormonal profile and cardiac function (Yarali et\u00a0al. 2001 ; Orio et\u00a0al. 2004 ; Rees et\u00a0al. 2014 ) in women with PCOS. It may be suggested that hyperandrogenism did not have a major effect on the findings of this study as only 27% (4/15) of PCOS women had evidence of hyperandrogenism and androgen levels in PCOS women were relatively low. However, the impact of severe hyperandrogenism on exercise responses in women with PCOS cannot be evaluated based on this study. The amount of LTPA was determined by self\u2010reporting, which is notable as overweight and obese individuals may overreport the amount of their physical activity (Prince et\u00a0al. 2008 ). However, possible overreporting hardly affected matching our subject groups for LTPA and thus the conclusions drawn. A\u00a0fairly small sample size also limits this study by affecting the statistical power of the results, highlighted in correlation analyses. However, we had the statistical power of 84.5% ( P <  0.05) to detect the difference in our main outcome ( V \u02d9 O 2 peak ) between PCOS women and controls, indicating the difference did not result from type I error.     Conclusions  Performing maximal incremental cycling exercise revealed reduced V \u02d9 O 2 peak , reduced C(a\u2010v)O 2 at peak exercise, and a steeper \u2206CO/\u2206 V \u02d9 O 2 slope in PCOS women when compared to control women matched for age, anthropometry, and physical activity. This can be regarded as an altered cardiorespiratory response to exercise in PCOS women. Eventually, PCOS women and controls attained similar cardiac function at peak exercise, while CaO 2 was similarly maintained in the groups. In summary, these findings indicate that PCOS per se is associated with alterations in peripheral adjustments to exercise rather than with limitations of systemic O 2 delivery in overweight and obese women. Future studies are warranted to identify detailed mechanisms of the altered peripheral adjustments indicated here.    Conflict of Interests  None declared.",
