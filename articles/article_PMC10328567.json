    "abstract": "Clinical efficacy of Fuke Qianjin tablets combined with clomiphene citrate on infertility patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was expected to be retrospectively analyzed in this study. In this paper, 100 infertility patients with PCOS were selected and divided into the observation and control groups based on different medications. Firstly, clinical data of both groups of patients were acquired. Then, the uterine receptivity and ovarian status, the levels of sex hormones, inflammation and oxidative stress, and the pregnancy outcomes between the 2 groups were compared and analyzed before and after treatment. After a variety of comparisons and analyses, Fuke Qianjin tablets combined with clomiphene citrate were confirmed to improve the uterine receptivity and ovarian status, levels of sex hormone, inflammation and oxidative stress, and pregnancy outcomes in infertility patients with PCOS. Overall, Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate treatment shows good clinical efficacy and is worth promotion in clinical practice.",
    "body": "1. Introduction  As the most common reproductive dysfunction disease currently, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the important factors leading to anovulatory infertility in women at reproductive age. [ 1 ] Clinically, PCOS is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. [ 2 ] It is worth mentioning that the pathogenesis of PCOS has not been completely clarified yet. Recent studies have pointed out that endocrine system disorders, [ 3 ] inflammatory responses, [ 4 ] and oxidative stress responses [ 5 ] play an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory responses and oxidative stress is vital to improving the clinical symptoms and promoting ovulation and pregnancy in patients with PSOS.  At present, the main modern medical therapies for PCOS consist of surgery, assisted reproductive technology and drugs. [ 6 ] Unfortunately, surgery and assisted reproductive technology may induce risks like pelvic adhesion, premature ovarian failure and some other complications; moreover, the surgery cost is so expensive that most patients can not accept it. [ 7 ] Concerning drug treatments, clomiphene citrate is the most commonly used ovulation-promoting drug. As a hormonal drug, clomiphene citrate can regulate the levels of estrogen bidirectionally. Briefly, clomiphene citrate produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone through inhibiting estrogens, thereby promoting the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as well as the generation and expulsion of follicles. [ 8 \u2013 10 ] However, the overall efficacy of clomiphene citrate was not satisfactory. For instance, clomiphene citrate brings about a series of problems such as luteal phase dysfunction, luteinization of follicles, thick cervical mucus, and thin endometrium in patients, causing a phenomenon of high ovulation rate and low conception rate. [ 11 ] According to the theory of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), PCOS belongs to the category of \u201camenorrhea\u201d and is caused by liver, kidney, and spleen dysfunction as well as phlegm-dampness and blood stasis. Hence, TCM advocates \u201cclearing away heat and removing dampness\u201d and \u201creplenishing qi and removing blood stasis\u201d for the treatment of PCOS. [ 12 ] Panax et al used a 3-dimensional culture system made of sodium alginate with different concentrations of ginseng extract to explore the effects on follicular function and development in vitro, and they found that Panax extract significantly promoted follicular development in mice. [ 13 ] This demonstrates that herbal preparations have a wide range of applications and research value in gynecological physiology and diseases. Furthermore, in recent years, western medicine combined with TCM therapy for POCS has not only been favored by many clinicians, but also achieved unique clinical efficacy. [ 11 ] Fuke Qianjin tablets, composed of herbs such as philippine flemingia root and cherokee rose root, [ 14 ] are representative of therapeutic drugs in the combined therapy. Characterized by functions like clearing heat and removing dampness, replenishing qi and removing blood stasis, Fuke Qianjin tablets are Chinese patent medicines commonly used to treat gynecological diseases clinically. [ 15 ] To provide a reference for the clinical treatment of PCOS, we compared the efficacy and mechanism of clomiphene citrate alone and Fuke Qianjin tablets combined with clomiphene citrate in treating infertility patients with PCOS in this paper.    2. Materials and methods   2.1. General information  In light of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 infertility patients with PCOS admitted to our hospital from August 2018 to August 2021 were selected. The included patients were divided into the observation (n\u2005=\u200550) and control groups (n\u2005=\u200550) according to the different drug treatments they received. Specifically, patients in the observation group received Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate treatment, while control patients received clomiphene citrate treatment alone. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hebei Institute of reproductive health science and technology.  The inclusion and exclusion criteria were shown as follows. [ 16 ] Briefly, patients were included in our study if they were diagnosed with PCOS by clinical or ultrasound examination according to the PCOS diagnostic criteria [ 17 ] ; were combined with infertility and presented with negative results of a urine pregnancy test before enrollment; possessed complete clinical data; and their families volunteered to participate in this study, knew the relevant rights and risks, and signed the informed consent. However, patients were excluded if they suffered from some other endocrine disorders like hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; had taken ovulation induction drugs or hormonal drugs within 3 months; suffered from infertility induced by other causes (such as inborn reproductive system dysplasia and tubal occlusion); Those with incomplete clinical information.    2.2. Therapeutic method  In the control group, patients were treated using clomiphene citrate (Heng Shan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shang Hai; Number: H31021107; specification: 50\u2009mg/grain). Notably, menstrual patients took clomiphene citrate (50\u2009mg/d) orally from the 5th days of menstruation and for 5 days. As for non-menstrual patients, the administration was started on any day (lasting 5 days). By the way, the patients were treated for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles.  In the observation group, patients received Fuke Qianjin tablets (Zhu zhou Qianjin pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Number: Z43020027; specification: 18 pieces\u2005\u00d7\u20054 plates)\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate treatment. Fuke Qianjin tablets (6 pieces/time and 3 times/days) were taken for 5 days, and the administration of clomiphene citrate was similar to the control group patients. The combined treatment lasted for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles.    2.3. Outcome measures    Comparison of uterine receptivity and ovarian status before and after treatment: endometrial thickness, uterine artery blood flow resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) score and ovarian volume.    Comparisons of sex hormone levels of patients before and after treatment in both groups: levels of estradiol (E 2 ), LH/FSH and prolactin (PRL).    Comparison of inflammation and oxidative stress levels before and after treatment: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA).    Comparisons between the 2 groups in ovulation rate and pregnancy outcome indicators after treatment: ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, ectopic pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate.      2.4. Statistical analysis  The SPSS 22.0 statistical software was employed for statistics and analysis of the data. Measurement data were expressed as mean\u2005\u00b1\u2005standard deviation; t test was used for data meeting normal distribution, and the rank sum test was for data not meeting normal distribution. Enumeration data were expressed as number of cases (%), and the \u03c7 2 test was utilized for comparison between groups. Additionally, P <\u2005.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.     3. Results   3.1. Baseline clinical data for patients  Clinical data of all patients before treatment were shown in Table 1 . Shortly speaking, there was no significant difference in age, duration of PCOS, body mass index and duration of infertility between the 2 groups ( P >\u2005.05).

Comparisons of uterine receptivity and ovarian status before and after treatment  As shown in Table 2 , the differences of endometrial thickness, RI, PI, F-G score and ovarian volume were not statistically significant between the observation group and the control group before treatment ( P >\u2005.05). After treatment, the RI, PI, F-G score and ovarian volume levels in the 2 groups were much lower than those before treatment, and the improvement in the observation group was preferred to that in the control group ( P <\u2005.05). In addition, the endometrium of patients after treatment was thickened compared with that before treatment in both groups; and relative to the control group, the observation group presented a more significant thickness change ( P <\u2005.05).

Discussion  PCOS is a gynecological disease closely related to hormone metabolism and an important cause of anovulatory infertility in women. Generally, PCOS occurs frequently during adolescence. Due to impaired follicular development and thickened follicular theca, the follicles cannot be expelled smoothly. Excessive follicular accumulation brings about endocrine disorders, thereby resulting in anovulatory infertility. [ 18 , 19 ] Clinical studies have stated that, in addition to causing infertility in patients, PCOS also increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reproductive system cancer. [ 20 ] Relevant epidemiological research reveals that ovulatory dysfunction or loss occurs in about 30.5% to 43.7% of PCOS patients. [ 21 ] Clinically, PCOS is mainly manifested as obesity, hirsutism, acne, irregular menstrual cycles, abnormal changes in bilateral polycystic ovaries, insulin resistance, and sex hormone disorders (such as elevated T, FSH, LH, and LH/FSH ratios). [ 22 ] In this study, the clinical data of 100 infertility patients with PCOS were retrospectively analyzed to investigate the therapeutic effect of clomiphene citrate\u2005+\u2005Fuke Qianjin tablets.  PCOS has been reported to be the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is closely associated with changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function. [ 23 ] Garg et al elaborated that increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsation in the hypothalamus leads to preferential secretion of LH by the pituitary gland, resulting in ovarian hyperandrogenism and oligo/anovulation. The resulting hyperandrogenism reduces the negative feedback of sex steroids (e.g., estradiol and progesterone) to the hypothalamus, thus perpetuating the increased GnRH pulsation. [ 23 ] Since there are no receptors for estrogen, progesterone, or androgens in GnRH neurons, it is presumed that the interruption of feedback occurs through upstream neurons. At present, Kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB) and Dynorphin neurons (called KNDy neurons) are thought to be possible upstream regulators of GnRH neuronal pulsation. [ 23 ] He also suggested that the growing understanding of the neuroendocrine dysfunction underlying enhanced GnRH pulsatility in PCOS has led to the investigation of pharmacological agents that specifically target the activity of these KNDy neurons to alleviate the symptoms of PCOS. [ 23 ] In addition, Garg et al elaborated the use of neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists as a way to reduce GnRH pulsatility and alleviate PCOS features such as hyperandrogenism, and in their article suggested other potential mechanisms to control increased GnRH pulsatility, which may form the basis of future research avenues. [ 23 ] In this article, F-G scores, ovarian volume, LH/FSH, PRL levels, RI and PI after treatment in both groups were decreased compared with those before treatment. Moreover, the decrease in the observation group was more remarkable than that in the control group. In addition, patients in both groups had thicker endometrium upon treatment than before treatment, and the thickening amplitude in the observation group was better than that in the control group. In a nutshell, Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate based on Chinese and Western medicine can improve uterine receptivity, ovarian status and sex hormone levels, consistent with the results of Zhou et al [ 24 ] Last but not least, the mechanism of the combined treatment may be associated with the role of Fuke Qianjin tablets in improving hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function, regulating the secretion of sex hormones, recovering menstrual cycle and repairing endometrium in PCOS patients. [ 25 ]  Studies have reported that the inflammatory response is involved in the occurrence and development of PCOS. [ 26 ] Generally, IL-6 and IL-17 are common inflammatory factors in the inflammatory response. IL6, secreted by mononuclear macrophages and T lymphocytes, mainly induces an expansion of the inflammatory response in a cascading manner; IL-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by Th17 cells, can enhance the inflammatory response by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase and the NF-\u03baB pathway. [ 27 ] According to the findings of previous clinical studies, IL-17 and IL-6 can induce inflammatory response, bring about insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, result in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction, make the sex hormone secretion abnormal, thereby promoting the development of PCOS. [ 28 ] Additionally, the oxidative stress response is also involved in the progression of PCOS. Normally, the body is in a dynamic balance of oxidation-antioxidation. However, oxidative stress induces an imbalance of antioxidants in the body, increasing oxygen free radical synthesis and reducing the removal of the radicals. A large accumulation of oxygen free radicals causes lipid peroxidation damage in tissue cells, leads to insulin resistance, [ 29 ] and promotes the onset of PCOS. [ 30 ] Moreover, oxidative stress response is also able to damage follicular theca and granulosa cells, increasing the risk of anovulatory infertility in PCOS patients. [ 31 ] Currently, MDA, SOD and GSH-Px are the main indicators to evaluate the oxidative stress response of the body. Among these 3 indicators, MDA is also an important product of lipid peroxidation injury apart from being a biochemical marker to appraise the oxidative stress response; and higher levels of MDA indicate stronger oxidative stress responses. As for SOD and GSH-Px, they are antioxidant active enzymes and important components for scavenging oxygen free radicals; higher activity levels of SOD and GSH-Px indicate a stronger response of the body to antioxidant stress. [ 32 ] Previous studies have shown that extracts of Apium graveolens and Cinnamon Zeylanicum can contribute to the alleviation of PCOS complications by modulating serum glucose, insulin, lipids, and oxidative stress markers. [ 33 ] Coenzyme Q10 in cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian injury delays premature ovarian failure in mice by reducing ROS levels and the number of atretic follicles in cyclophosphamide-treated mice ovaries through antioxidant and proliferative properties. [ 34 ] Majid et al also showed that Olea europaea extract could reduce the extent of tissue damage caused by oxidative stress and apoptosis after ovarian ischemia/reperfusion. [ 35 ] These studies suggest that both herbal and Western medicines can play a therapeutic role in ovarian-related diseases through processes such as anti-oxidative stress.  In this study, IL-6, IL-17 and MDA levels after treatment were decreased while SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly increased in comparison with those before treatment. The improvement in the observation group was much better than that in the control group. All in all, Fuke Qianjin tablets combined with clomiphene citrate can improve the inflammatory response and oxidative stress response of the uterus.  Fuke Qianjin tablets are composed of philippine flemingia root, cherokee rose root, herba andrographis, leatherleaf mahonia stem, zanthoxylum dissitum hemsley, radix angelicae sinensis, caulis spatholobi, radix codonopsis, and so on. Philippine flemingia root can be used for eliminating wind and removing dampness as well as resolving blood stasis and detoxicating; cherokee rose root, herba andrographis, and leatherleaf mahonia stem for clearing away heat and detoxicating; zanthoxylum dissitum hemsley for replenishing qi and relieving pain; radix angelicae sinensis, caulis spatholobi and radix codonopsis for activating blood and nourishing blood as well as replenishing qi and invigorating spleen. All herbs play a role in clearing away heat and removing dampness as well as replenishing qi and resolving stasis. Studies have pointed out that Fuke Qianjin tablets can inhibit the synthesis of serum inflammatory response factors, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory functions. What more, there are abundant active components of codonopsis pilosula polysaccharides in Fuke Qianjin tablets, making them show strong anti-oxidative stress ability. [ 36 ] In this paper, the anti-inflammatory effect of Fuke Qianjin tablets was further confirmed; moreover, the ovulation rate and pregnancy outcome of PCOS patients treated with Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate were preferred to those treated with clomiphene citrate alone. In a word, Fuke Qianjin tablets may improve the clinical symptoms and promote the ovulation and conception of PCOS patients by inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function of the body, promoting normal sex hormone secretion, and other biological pathways. [ 12 , 37 ]  Nevertheless, as a retrospective study, there are some shortcomings in this paper. For example, the sample size was small, which may have brought some biases to the results. Therefore, a multicenter, large-sample prospective study is required to be performed in the future. In addition, the mechanism of action of clomiphene combined with Fuke Qianjin tablets in the treatment of PCOS needs to be further explored in basic research. At the same time, due to the complex composition of TCM, it is necessary to clarify the active ingredients of the drugs that play a role. Therefore, in future research, further research can be conducted on the active ingredients of TCM that play a role in Fuke Qianjin tablets, which is beneficial for the development and clinical application of Fuke Qianjin tablets.    5. Conclusion  Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate can increase ovulation rates and change pregnancy outcomes by increasing uterine receptivity, improving ovarian status and levels of sex hormone, and inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress levels in infertility patients with PCOS. Collectively, Fuke Qianjin tablets\u2005+\u2005clomiphene citrate exhibits good clinical efficacy and is worth promotion and application in clinical practice.
