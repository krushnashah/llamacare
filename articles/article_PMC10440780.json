    "body": "Introduction  PCOS, or polycystic ovarian syndrome, is one of the most common endocrinopathy, affecting around 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. On ultrasound examination, cystic ovaries are present, as well as amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, obesity, hyper-androgenism, and anovulation infertility ( 1 ). The main cause of PCOS is CYP17A1 dysregulation by P450 17\u03b1-related steroid hormone synthesis. CYP17A1 gene is located on chromosome 10q24.3 and has 8 exons and 7 introns. The CYP17A1 gene encodes the key enzyme 17-\u03b1-hydroxylase/17-20 lyase (P45017\u03b1) that contributes to the androgen synthesis pathway and biosynthesis pathways of the ovary and adrenal ( 2 ). The promoter 5 \u2018untranslated region of the CYP17A1 MSP AI (T-34C/ rs 743572) has a polymorphism that affects gene expression regulation. The presence of this polymorphism may result in enhanced androgen synthesis. There are conflicting studies on the role of the CYP17A1 MSP Al polymorphism in PCOS susceptibility ( 3 , 4 ). Over the last two decades, a number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association between CYP17A1 T/C polymorphisms and PCOS risk in humans. But these studies reported conflicting results. Some researchers concluded that this C substitution of the CYP17A1 gene might be associated to the high risk of PCOS and maybe marked as a pathogenic gene of PCOS ( 1 , 5 ), whereas others found the contradictory result ( 6 - 9 ). In addition, some scholars issued that the association of rs 7432592 with PCOS is uncertain ( 10 ), as this SNP may indirectly affect PCOS through the association between testosterone level and insulin resistance ( 11 ). Different methodologies have been used, but, in particular, most of the studies used a small sample size and it is therefore not surprising that there has been a lack of replication in various studies. Based on the dissimilarity of case-control results and the ambiguous pathological mechanism of PCOS, an updated meta-analysis was designed to characterize better the relationship between CYP17A1 SNP rs 743572 and PCOS risk.    Materials and methods  This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) ( 12 ). As this was a meta-analysis, ethical approval was not required.   Publication search  Studies were searched on PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase databases for all articles on the association between CYP17A1 T/C polymorphisms and PCOS risk. The following keywords were used: \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d or \u201cPCOS\u201d or \u201cStein-Leventhal syndrome\u201d or \u201cmulti-pouch ovary syndrome\u201d, \u201c17\u03b1-hydroxylase\u201d or \u201cCYP17A1\u201d, and \u201cSNP\u201d or \u201cpolymorphisms\u201d or \u201cmutation\u201d or \u201cgenotype\u201d or \u201cvariant\u201d. The search was without restriction on language, conducted on human subjects. The reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles were hand searched at the same time. If more than one article was published by the same author using the same case series, we selected the study where the most individuals were investigated.    Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Eligible studies were involved if they met many criteria. We first screened by reading the title and abstract and then reviewed the full text according to the following criteria for the second screen: (i). The papers should adopt widely recognized and representative diagnostic criteria for PCOS: NIH criteria ( 13 ) or Rotterdam criteria ( 14 ) which case-control studies were conducted to evaluate the association between CYP17A1 T/C polymorphism and PCOS risk; (ii). Sufficient genotype data were presented to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); (iii) the paper should clearly describe PCOS diagnoses and the sources of cases and controls. Major reasons for the exclusion of studies were: (a) duplicate data; (b) abstract, comment, review and editorial; (c) no sufficient data were reported.    Data extraction  Data were extracted from all eligible articles separately. Included papers were organized and the following information was obtained: (i). The first author of the research, publication year, source of control, original country, and the ethnicity of subjects. (ii). Evidence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (iii). Genotyping method. (iv). Genotype frequencies of TT, TC, CC of PCOS group, and control group. After that, a rigorous literature evaluation was carried out. Asian and Caucasian ethnicity have been categorized. If original genotype frequency data were unavailable in relevant articles, a request was sent to the corresponding author for additional data. Furthermore, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test was also calculated and adjusted manually.    Statistical analysis  To begin with, the p- value of the control group\u2019s Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was calculated online (https://wpcalc.com/en/equilibrium-hardy-weinberg/), and the literature with a p -value less than 0.05 could be regarded as not in line with HWE. The strength of the association between PCOS and the CYP17A1 T/C polymorphism was estimated using ORs, with the corresponding 95% CIs and p -value calculated by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Software 3.0. The pooled ORs and p -value in a fixed-effect model (fixed effect estimate method: Inverse variance) and a random effect model (Random effect estimate method: DerSimonian-Laird) of the association test were performed under 7 genetic models: for the recessive model (CC vs . CT+TT), dominant model (CC+CT vs . TT), over-dominant model (CT vs . CC+TT), CC vs . TT model, CC vs . CT model, CT vs . TT model, and the allele contrast (C vs . T). Forest plot for each model was generated by the CMA software. We also carried out the stratified analyses by ethnicity, country, HWE in controls and study sample size. Both the Cochran\u2019s Q statistics to test for heterogeneity and the I^2 statistics to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated. A p -value of more than the nominal level of 0.05 for the Q statistic indicated a lack of heterogeneity across studies, allowing for the use of a fixed-effect model (the Mantel-Haenszel method); otherwise, the random effect model (the Der Simonian and Laird method) was used. To explore sources of heterogeneity across studies, we did logistic meta-regression analyses by CMA Software 3.0 (https://www.meta-analysis.com/).    Heterogeneity, sensitive analysis and publication bias  Several methods were used to assess the potential publication bias. Visual inspection of generated funnel plot asymmetry was conducted. The Begg\u2019s rank correlation method and the Egger\u2019s weighted regression methods were used to statistically assess publication bias and p -value \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were done using CMA software 3.0.     Results   Literature retrieval results and characteristics of studies  According to PRISMA flow diagram guidelines ( Figure 1 ), a total of 88 articles were obtained from the original search after the exclusion of duplicates. The examination of the title and abstract performed on these articles led to the removal of 50 studies and 38 continued to detailed assessment.   Figure\u00a01.   Prisma flow diagram.     After screening the full text of these publications, 14 articles were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 24 eligible case-control studies were included in this review ( 1 , 4 - 11 , 15 - 29 ). There were 17 studies of Asian patients and 7 studies of Caucasian patients.

All studies extracted DNA from peripheral blood. Twenty-two of the 24 studies used the classic PCR-RFLP method, and the other two studies used different molecular genotyping methods, such as Taqman, PCR-SSCP.

The overall results validated that the 17 CYP17A1 T/C ( rs 74357) gene polymorphism was significantly associated with PCOS risk in five genetic models: the recessive model (CC vs . CT+TT) fixed and random effect, dominant model (CC+CT vs . TT) random effect, CC vs . TT (CT vs . CC+TT) fixed effect, CT vs . TT fixed effect, and allele contrast (C vs . T) random effect. However, the variant genotypes (CC and TC) were not associated with PCOS risk, compared with the wild-type TT homozygous under two comparison models: over-dominant model (CT vs . CC+TT) and CC vs . CT model.  On the basis of the potential overestimation of the true effect of the polymorphism on the PCOS risk, we stratified these studies according to ethnicity, country, HWE in controls and study sample size. Stratified analyses by ethnicity/country also detected significant association under the five genetic models described above in Asian and Caucasian populations: recessive model, dominant model, CC vs . TT, and allele contrast. However, on the CT vs . TT comparison model, significant difference was found only in Asian ( Table 3 ).   Table\u00a03.   Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity.

TT, CT vs . TT, allele contrast. Due to this high heterogeneity, we conducted logistic meta-regression and subgroup analysis to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity with the following covariates: ethnicity (Asian, Caucasian), country (China or other), HWE in controls (yes or not), diagnostic criteria (Rotterdam criteria, NIH criteria) and genotyping approaches (PCR-RFLP or others). After estimating each covariate\u2019s potential contribution to heterogeneity by logistic meta-regression under CMA software, we found that all the p -value were > 0.05, which meant the heterogeneity could be attributed to none of the factors above. However, subgroup analysis indicated significantly decreasing heterogeneity in the Caucasian and NIH criteria subgroups. Thus, it was deduced that ethnicity and diagnosis criteria might be the main source of high heterogeneity.    Sensitivity analysis and publication bias  Begg\u2019s Funnel plot and Egger\u2019s test were performed to evaluate sensitivity and publication. Displayed a funnel plot that examined the CYP17A1 T/C polymorphism and overall PCOS risk included in the meta-analysis in the dominant model. The shape of funnel plots did not reveal any evidence of funnel plot asymmetry. The statistical results still did not show publication bias using the seven genetic models: recessive model ( P = 0.166), dominant model ( P = 0.300), over-dominant model ( P = 0.243), CC vs . TT model ( P = 0.074), CC vs . CT model ( P = 0.918), CT vs . TT model ( P = 0.399), and the allele contrast (C vs . T) ( P = 0.067).  To assess sensitivity and the effect of an individual study on the overall meta-analysis estimate, we excluded one study at a time, and the exclusion of any single report did not alter the significance of the final decision, suggesting that the outcomes were robust. Finally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated any individual article did not constitute the source of heterogeneity since removing any single article would not affect the stability of the overall estimate.     Discussion  Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a multifaceted disorder caused by anomalies in genetics, metabolism, endocrine function, and environmental factors. Obesity-related health complications such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, anovulation, infertility, trouble in conception, and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes are widely established in PCOS women ( 30 ). The indication of family-based and association case-control studies suggests that PCOS has a substantial genetic foundation, although the genes prompting to PCOS have yet to be clearly defined. The candidate genes predisposing to PCOS comprise those indicated in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis and also those genes that influence body mass index (BMI) and adiposity ( 31 ). It has been proposed that an amplified activity of ovarian P450c17\u03b1, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of androgens, is the fundamental disorder in the ovarian hyperandrogenism observed in this syndrome ( 9 ). Consequently, the initial investigations focused on the possible role of CYP17A1 , the gene that codes for cytochrome P450c17\u03b1, located on chromosome 10q24.3. A polymorphism has been found in the regulatory region of the CYP17A1 gene, being a T to C substitution -34 bp from the translation start point in the promoter region. It has been proposed that this modification may up-regulate the expression of CYP17A1 , resulting in an increased synthesis of androgens ( 29 ). The obvious contribution of the genetic factor to this syndrome was observed, and the involvement of the CYP17A1 gene polymorphism in raising the probability of PCOS was noted through multiple case control and meta-analysis studies. However, several studies have shown that the T to C substitution at 34 bp upstream the 5\u2019 promoter region of the CYP17A1 gene was associated with PCOS; while some have found the opposite ( 2 ).  The present meta-analysis integrated the updated published studies of the CYP17A1 gene through comprehensive literature retrieval as well as systematic analysis and explored the relationship between the CYP17A1 gene and PCOS. To the best of our knowledge, CYP17A1 encodes the enzyme 17-\u03b1-hydroxylase/17\u201320 lyase (P45017\u03b1), which is a rate-limiting enzyme in androgen synthesis. Diamanti-Kandarakis et al ., 1999 was the first to propose that CYP17A1 T/C gene polymorphism could be responsible for the deregulation of gene CYP17A1 expression, which aggravated hyperandrogenemia of PCOS ( 15 ), which was later supported by Pusalkar et al ., 2009 ( 1 ), who described a strong association of CYP17A1 T/C gene polymorphism with PCOS. In the current study, more frequencies of the polymorphic C allele and CC genotype were discovered in women with PCOS than in controls, which supported the hypothesis that the significance of the association was found to be more significant compared with controls. It was hypothesized that this polymorphism could generate an additional sp1 binding site near the promoter, which enhanced transcription activity of CYP17A1 expression and produced hyperandrogenism. However, experimental studies have not confirmed this finding ( 2 ).This meta-analysis results validated that the 17 CYP17A1 T/C ( rs 74357) gene polymorphism was significantly associated with PCOS risk in 5 genetic models: recessive model (fixed and random effect), dominant model (random effect), CC vs . TT (fixed effect), CT vs . TT (fixed effect), and allele contrast (random effect). Stratified analyses by ethnicity/country also detected significant association between Asian and Caucasian under the recessive, dominant, CC vs . TT, CC vs . CT, and the allele contrast models. All these data suggest a very strong implication of the studied polymorphism independent of ethnic factors.  This meta-analysis does, however, have certain limitations. First, the number of studies included in the meta-analysis and the number of cases and controls in the studies included in specific subgroups were both limited. As a result, more research with a larger sample size and more detailed information is required. Second, because not all published studies offered adjusted ORs, or when they did, the ORs were not adjusted for the same possible confounders, such as age, ethnicity, and exposures, our meta-analysis was based on unadjusted OR estimates. The limited information for data analysis could result in substantial confounding bias. Third, investigations of the polymorphism showed high between-study variability, and the genotype distribution included deviated from HWE case-control study ( 15 , 18 , 20 ).  Despite these disadvantages, our meta-analysis has certain advantages. First and foremost, a rigorous search. The use of a computer-assisted search method allowed as many eligible studies to be included as possible. Second, the case-control studies included in this meta-analysis were of acceptable quality and matched our inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the meta-analysis approach was well designed before it was started, with specific methods for research selection, data extraction, and data analysis (PRISMA). Also, the meta-analysis was performed using the latest version (3.0) of the reference software for performing meta-analysis in genetics (Comprehensive Meta Analysis).  Furthermore, more research evaluating the impact of gene\u2013gene and gene-environment interactions could lead to a more complete understanding of the link between the CYP17A1 T/C polymorphism and PCOS risk.    Conclusion  The current findings in our meta-analysis result suggest that gene polymorphisms influence the expression and production of CYP17A1 and the CYP17A1 T/C ( rs 74357) gene polymorphism plays an important role in increasing the susceptibility of PCOS when carrying the C allele (genotype TC and CC). Despite the undoubted connection of CYP17A1 gene polymorphism to PCOS, the range to which CYP17A1 gene polymorphism contributes to metabolic dysfunction in PCOS is unidentified and needs further study. Meanwhile, due to the strong correlation between PCOS and CYP17A1rs 7435742 polymorphism, it could be used as a genetic marker for PCOS, and might supply another tool for assessing women\u2019s susceptibility. Likewise, the CYP17A1 could be applied to the treatment of PCOS as a potentially feasible target.",
