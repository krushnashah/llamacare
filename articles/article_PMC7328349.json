    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinological condition which is\nfound to be prevalent in 5\u201310% of women in the reproductive age group 1 and can vary between subpopulations. It was in 1935 that Stein and Leventhal\nfirst described this unique gynaecological condition. They described this syndrome\nbased on seven women who had a combination of obesity, hirsutism, amenorrhoea and\nbilateral enlarged polycystic ovaries. 2 , 3 Since its first\ncharacterisation, there has been a vast evolvement in our understanding of its\netiology, diagnosis and treatment. In the early 1990s, the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) first proposed a diagnostic criterion for PCOS. It defined PCOS as a\ncombination of oligo-anovulation and androgen excess after ruling out all other\nreasons for anovulatory infertility. 4 Ultrasound criteria for polycystic ovaries were considered \u2018suggestive\u2019 but\nnot diagnostic of PCOS. These criteria were based on consensus expert opinion rather\nthan the evidence from clinical trials. In 2003, the European Society for Human\nReproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society for Reproductive\nMedicine (ASRM) amended the NIH criteria and included ultrasound features of\npolycystic ovaries as the third diagnostic criteria. 5 The diagnosis of PCOS was established if a woman met two criteria out of the\nthree. This was based on the observation that polycystic ovaries were consistent in\nwomen with biochemical and clinical evidence of the syndrome. Women with PCOS\ndiagnosed by the Rotterdam Criteria can be further divided into four phenotypes, A\nto D, based on the criteria qualifying for diagnosis. In 2006, the Androgen Excess\nSociety (AES) reviewed existing data and concluded that the original criteria set by\nNIH in 1990s can be accepted along with some modifications based on the expert\nopinion at the 2003 Rotterdam conference. In addition to the above classifications,\nAziz and colleagues, 6 in an AES guideline, suggested nine phenotypes incorporating the criteria of\nanovulation/oligo-ovulation, clinical hirsutism, biochemical hyperandrogenism and\nultrasound feature of polycystic ovaries. The Rotterdam criteria were endorsed by\nthe global PCOS guideline published in 2018. The various diagnostic criteria are\nsummarised in Table\n1 .   Table 1.   Diagnostic criteria for PCOS.           1990 NIH guidelines:  Patient satisfies both criteria: (1) Clinical or\nbiochemical hyperandrogenism (2) Oligomenorrhoea or\noligo-ovulation Other causes of hyperandrogenism and\nanovulatory subfertility should be excluded.    2003 ESHRE/ASRM or Rotterdam guidelines:  Patient satisfies two of three criteria: (1)\nOligomenorrhoea or oligo-ovulation (2) Clinical or\nbiochemical hyperandrogenism (3) Polycystic ovaries on\nultrasound Other causes of hyperandrogenism and\nanovulatory subfertility should be excluded.    2006 AES guidelines:  Patient satisfies both criteria: (1)\nHyperandrogenism: hirsutism or biochemical\nhyperandrogenism (2) Ovarian dysfunction:\noligo-anovulation or polycystic ovaries Other causes of\nhyperandrogenism and anovulatory subfertility should be\nexcluded.

Despite the consensus diagnostic criteria being in common use globally, there still\nexist several controversies in the diagnosis. This article aims to summarise the\nvarious controversies arising in the diagnosis of PCOS.    Irregular cycles and ovarian dysfunction  It has been observed that almost three quarters of patients diagnosed with PCOS have\nabnormal menstruation. 7 In adults, a regular cycle indicates any woman who is menstruating between 24\nand 35\u2009days, 8 which suggests an ovulatory cycle. Irregular cycles, which reflect ovarian\ndysfunction and oligo-anovulation, form one of the essential features of the\nRotterdam criteria.  Serum progesterone levels can be measured by radioimmunoassay in the mid-luteal phase\nto confirm ovulation. In women with irregular cycles, the test might need to be\nmeasured later in the cycle depending on the length of the cycle. The test might\nalso need to be measured every 7\u2009days till menstruation commences. If the menstrual\ncycles are very irregular, measuring serum progesterone is futile as diagnosis is\nbased on clinical features and ovulation induction therapy is indicated. 9 The lower limit of serum progesterone level to confirm ovulation ranges from\n16\u2009to 28\u2009nmol/L. 10  \u2013 13  The greatest controversy hovering around this diagnostic criterion remains in\ndefining \u2018irregular cycles\u2019 during pubertal transition. The accurate diagnosis is\nstill challenging due to very limited evidence on this subject. During pubertal\ntransition, distinguishing irregular cycles due to reproductive immaturity from\nthose due to PCOS is quite challenging due to lack of a clear definition. In the\nfirst 2\u20133 years following menarche, the cycles may be irregular and most cycles\nrange between 21 and 45\u2009days. 14 Studies show that the lower limit of a normal cycle is 21\u2009days. The upper\nlimit is somewhat variable at 40\u201345\u2009days. 15 \u2013 17 Cycles more than 90\u2009days\nrepresent 95th percentile for length, and this should warrant further assessment\neven if seen in the first gynaecological year where gynaecological age is\nconceptualised as number of years after menarche. Three years after menarche, most\ncycles are like adults. 15 , 18  It has been concluded that frequency of ovulatory cycles is related to time since\nmenarche as well as age of menarche. Earlier does a girl attain her menarche,\nearlier are her ovulatory cycles. When the age of menarche is less than 12\u2009years,\nhalf of the cycles are ovulatory in the first gynaecologic year, and almost all are\novulatory by their fifth gynaecologic year. In contrast, it was noted that in girls\nwith late onset of menarche, it could take up to 8\u201312\u2009years for all cycles to be ovulatory. 18  Recent data suggest that in the first-year post menarche, about half of the cycles\nare anovulatory. Most of them occur in a range of 21\u201345\u2009days, lasting 2\u20137 days. Two\nyears post menarche, 80% of irregular cycles tends to be ovulatory. By the\nthird-year post menarche, 95% of cycles are regular and ovulatory and it is in these\n5% of girls with irregular cycles that PCOS should be considered. 19  \u2013 22  The ESHRE international evidence-based guidelines recommendations around irregular\ncycles in adolescents are based on paediatric consensus opinion. This consensus\nrecommends that if an adolescent girl has irregular periods (<21\u2009days\nor\u2009>35\u2009days) even after 3 years of menarche, she should be assessed for PCOS. 22  If a girl has irregular cycles with many months of period-free intervals,\nparticularly if she has signs of hyperandrogenism in the first few gynaecologic\nyears, she should be assessed to rule out PCOS rather than reassuring it to be a\nnormal phase of pubertal transition. 20 , 23  Many adolescents may be considered or may already be on oral contraceptive pill (OCP)\ntreatment. The ESHRE international guidelines recommend assessment of menstrual\ncycle patterns as well as assessment of clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism\nbefore commencing OCP therapy in adolescents with irregular cycles after 1 year of\nmenarche. If baseline assessment is abnormal, they must be explained about the risk\nof PCOS and might warrant further reassessment. If a baseline assessment has not\nbeen undertaken, it may be appropriate to stop the pills for 3 months and then\nassess to rule out PCOS. 22  To summarise, it is still unclear when adolescent menstrual irregularity becomes\npathophysiological. In adolescents, setting a clear-cut boundary between PCOS and\nnormal physiological immaturity of hypothalamic pituitary axis is controversial.\nThis could in turn potentially lead to over- or underdiagnosis which could lead to\nchange in overall prevalence of the condition. Identifying the natural course of\nPCOS in young girls as well as early predictors by further longitudinal studies will\nallow appropriate and timely diagnosis.    Biochemical hyperandrogenism  It has been found that more than three quarters of women who have PCOS have increased\ncirculating androgen levels. 6 PCOS can be picked up by assessing biochemical hyperandrogenism especially in\nwomen who lack the signs of hirsutism or have unclear signs of hirsutism.\nControversy arises on which androgens to measure, defining normal ranges for these,\nwhich assays to use, cost factors, access to high-quality tests and also overlap\nbetween control and PCOS patients.   What androgens to measure  The androgens that are often measured include total testosterone (TT), free\ntestosterone (FT), calculated bioavailable testosterone (BA-T), calculated free\ntestosterone (calculated FT) using the formula of Vermeulen and colleagues, 24 free androgen index [FAI\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(total testosterone/sex hormone-binding\nglobulin [SHBG])], dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and\nandrostenedione.  The use of TT can identify 20\u201330% of PCOS women as hyperandrogenemic. However,\nonly 1\u20133% of testosterone is unbound to plasma proteins, thus raising concerns\nwhether TT or FT is the most clinically useful measure. FT can identify 50\u201360%\nof such women with PCOS as hyperandrogenemic. The levels of SHBG are reduced in\nwomen with PCOS resulting in a further increase in FT. Androstenedione can be\nmild to moderately elevated in PCOS. Androstenedione can be elevated in PCOS,\nbut marked rise indicates adrenal pathology especially 21-OH deficient\nnonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Elevated levels of 17\nhydroxyprogesterone can indicate nonclassic CAH, 21-hydroxylase deficiency type,\nwhich is a milder and late onset form of CAH.  Another useful measure is FAI, which is the ratio of TT to SHBG multiplied by 100\nand hence its measurement requires accurate measurement of testosterone and\nSHBG. FAI results can be biased by inaccuracies in measurements of testosterone\nand SHBG. 25 Studies show an acceptable correlation between FAI and FT. 25  Hahn and colleagues 26 included 133 untreated PCOS patients and 54 healthy control women and\nmeasured androgens which included TT and SHBG, luteinizing hormone (LH),\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androstenedione, DHEAS and albumin. They\nconcluded that PCOS patients had a significantly higher levels of androgens\nresponsible for biochemical hyperandrogenism than controls (all p <\u20090.0001). The highest area under receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC-ROC) in decreasing order was found for BA-T (0.852),\nFAI (0.847) and FT (0.837). AUC-ROC was found to be lower for SHBG, TT and\nandrostenedione. The correlation of FAI and BA-T with TT, androstenedione,\nLH/FSH ratio and DHEAS was found to be statistically significant with p value\u2009<\u20090.05 for all the parameters. In addition, FT,\nBA-T and FAI correlated well with other nonbiochemical parameters like hirsutism\nas well as ultrasound parameters of PCOS. 22 Escobar-Morreale and colleagues 27 recruited 114 women and measured various androgens as well as FSH, LH and\nestradiol. Based on ROC calculated for all, they strongly suggested that higher\nlevels of FAI, FT and DHEA and reduced SHBG were effective measures for\ndetection of PCOS. 22 Villarroel and colleagues 81 recruited 26 hirsute girls with irregular cycles and 63 nonhirsute girls\nwith regular cycles as controls. They concluded that the best diagnostic tests\nwere FAI\u2009\u2a7e\u20096.1 and testosterone\u2009\u2a7e\u20092.4\u2009nmol/L. Follicle number\u2009\u2a7e\u200912 and ovarian\nvolume (OV)\u2009\u2a7e\u200910\u2009mL provided similar diagnostic accuracy. Anti-Mullerian hormone\n(AMH) did not prove to have high diagnostic accuracy.  Measuring TT comes with their own limitations. TT values show variation depending\non the time of the day they were taken and that many similar steroids present in\nthe circulation tend to interfere with the assay. Also, age- and\ngender-corrected reference values are lacking and there is no universally\naccepted testosterone calibrating standard. 25  Based on all the evidence, ESHRE PCOS guideline group 2018 22 concluded that though there is inadequate evidence to recommend which\nandrogens to measure, they suggest that FT provides the best accuracy to detect\nbiochemical hyperandrogenism. The other hormones that could be tested are TT,\nDHEAS and androstenedione. DHEAS and androstenedione on its own do not provide\nadditional information regarding hyperandrogenemia in PCOS.  Many women are on OCPs when they are seen in the clinics. Measuring these\nhormones cannot reliably assess hyperandrogenism as inherent increase in SHBG\nand reduction in gonadotropin-dependent androgen production due to medication\neffect. Hence before testing these hormones, OCPs should be discontinued for at\nleast 3\u2009months.    Hormonal assays  The assays that are used to measure androgens to diagnose PCOS include liquid\nchromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), gas chromatographic mass\nspectrometry (GCMS), radioimmunoassay (RIA), chemiluminescence immunoassays\n(CLIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Based on the studies and data available, measuring FT provides the best ability\nto detect biochemical hyperandrogenism. Unfortunately, direct assays to measure\nFT are not entirely reliable. Direct assays like RIA, ELISA and CLIA are\ntechnically simple, relatively inexpensive and can be automated. These measure\nTT. The testosterone measurement using these assays is designed for males where\nthe levels are higher compared with lower levels in women. Hence their accuracy\nis limited at testosterone levels\u2009<300\u2009ng/dL. 28 Also, testosterone levels are overestimated with these assays, they are\nnot standardised, are of insufficient precision and also show poor sensitivity.\nRIA and chromatography is widely used with well-documented reference values\namong different populations and has better sensitivity than CLIA and ELISA but\nis rather labour intensive, costly and time consuming.  MS after extraction and liquid (LC) or gas chromatography (GC) are highly\naccurate when validated properly but are expensive and current standardisation\nis still lacking. 25 High-quality assays (LC-MS/MS and extraction/chromatography immunoassays)\nto assess total or unbound (free) testosterone provide the best possible accuracy. 22 Many of these assays have their limitations in that the reference ranges\nin different laboratories vary widely and are often based on an arbitrary\npercentile or variances of the mean of the values observed in a population.     Clinical hyperandrogenism  Mild-to-moderate androgen excess is represented by hirsutism, alopecia and acne.\nWomen with PCOS can present with one or more signs of hyperandrogenism.   Hirsutism  Hirsutism is described as terminal hair in male-like pattern in women. An\noverestimation of hirsutism can easily be made if body and facial vellus hair is\nwrongly perceived as terminal hair. Terminal hair is distinctive as they can\ngrow beyond 5\u2009mm. It is also important to bear in mind that different ethnic\ngroups can have denser vellus hair and hence hirsutism can be overestimated.\nConfirming hirsutism can also be challenging as many women have often treated\nexcess hair growth before presenting to the clinics.  One of the methods that is most widely used to assess hirsutism and grade its\nseverity is the modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey (mFG) score. It includes assessment of\nnine body areas, and each area is visually scored from 0 to 4. A pictorial\nrepresentation is then made.  The biggest controversy is defining a \u2018cut-off\u2019 value for the mFG score to\ndiagnose hirsutism. There is a strong difference in the prevalence and severity\nof hirsutism in different ethnic groups. Although this is known, unfortunately,\nthere appears to be little difference in the cut-off values for determining\nexcess terminal facial and body hair as abnormal (i.e. defining \u2018hirsutism\u2019).\nThe mFG cut-off score can be based on percentile with a score\u2009>6\u20138 consistent\nwith the 95th percentile of unselected women. 29 \u2013 31 It can also be defined by\na lower percentile (85th\u201390th percentile) or by cluster analysis where the score\nis analysed in relation to other features of PCOS. Many studies have concluded\nthat a lower mFG score 32 for black and white women compared with Asian women 33 represents true abnormality. Thus, generalising a cut-off at the 95th\npercentile is not appropriate and hence the ESHRE PCOS guideline 2018\nrecommended the cut-off of \u2a7e4\u20136 on mFG score. Overall, more than half of women\nwith mFG scores of 3\u20135 34 and almost three fourths (>70\u201390%) of women with\nscores\u2009>5 29 , 35 have elevated androgens or PCOS.    Acne  Acne can be associated with biochemical hyperandrogenism. Unlike hirsutism which\noffers a good predictive value for hyperandrogenism, the predictive value of\nacne is still unclear. There are not many studies looking at predictive value of\nacne, most of them being retrospective. 36 , 37 Unlike hirsutism, we lack\nan accepted scoring system to clinically evaluate and measure acne. Overall,\nwhile acne in women might indicate androgen excess, the predictive value of acne\nalone for hyperandrogenism remains unclear.    Male pattern hair loss  Diffuse sagittal alopecia can be seen in women with PCOS. The Ludwig scale, 38 with a range from grade I to grade III, indicates increasing severity and\ncan be used to visually assess scalp hair loss. On its own, its predictive value\nas a marker of androgen excess is unclear.     Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology  Ovarian follicles undergo a continuous process of recruitment and apoptosis through\nreproductive life. This starts in foetal life, continues throughout childhood and\nadulthood and stops at menopause. OV changes over time with changes in antral\nfollicles and stromal development. Most women with clinical and endocrinological\nfeatures of PCOS demonstrated ovaries which are polycystic on ultrasound; hence this\nfeature was added as a third inclusion criterion in 2003. 39  Various ultrasound features have been identified as a feature in women with PCOS\nwhich include antral follicle count (AFC), follicular number per ovary (FNPO), OV,\novarian area (OA), ovarian blood flow and ratio of stroma to total ovarian size.   Antral follicle count  AFC is considered to be a good measure to identify the severity of reproductive\ndysfunction in PCOS. Increased AFC was most significantly associated with\nincreased androgens and LH:FSH ratio. 40 The polycystic ovaries in PCOS can be confused with other causes of\nmultifollicular ovaries which could be both physiological (puberty) and\npathological (hypothalamic anovulation, hyperprolactinaemia, central precocious\npuberty). As multifollicular ovaries are considered physiological in the early\nyears of reproductive life (within 8\u2009years of menarche), diagnosing PCOS based\non ultrasound criteria in adolescents is not appropriate.  Earlier studies showed greatest sensitivity for defining polycystic ovaries from\na count of 10 or more follicles arranged peripherally around dense core stoma\n(Adams criteria) 41 while a definition of 12 or more follicles 42 offered a greater specificity. Most of authors had initially set this\nthreshold at 10 43 , 44 but some authors recommended 15. 45 Following a consensus opinion in 2003, the count was then changed over\nto\u2009>12 follicles measuring 2\u20139 mm in diameter.  With advances in ultrasound and better transducer frequencies, significant\nincrease in FNPO was reported with transducer frequency of\u2009>8\u2009MHz. The\nprevious threshold for FNPO of 12 or more resulted in a significantly greater\nprevalence of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in women especially below\n30\u2009years of age in a general population. 46  \u2013 49 Eleven studies which\nincluded 2961 participants looked at FNPO and concluded optimal sensitivity and\nspecificity with\u2009>19 per ovary. The grid system method to count antral\nfollicle, which was devised by Lujan and colleagues in 2010, is the most\nreproducible technique. This technique showed a sensitivity of 85% and\nspecificity of 94% when 26 follicles per ovary was taken as a cut-off. This\ncut-off may miss mild form of PCOS. Others 50 suggested lower threshold of 19 follicles.  Counting antral follicles and setting a threshold is controversial, especially,\nas different populations and counting techniques may account for differences.\nThere are also differences in the method of counting the follicles, observer\nvariability in assessing follicle number and variable ultrasound technology.  When diagnosing PCOM on transvaginal scan, ESHRE PCOS guideline group 2018 have\nsuggested to use a cut-off of FNPO of 20 or more in one or both the ovaries or\nOV\u2009>10\u2009mL without inclusion of dominant follicle or corpus luteum or any\ncysts. This cut-off is to be used when using a transvaginal scan with a\nfrequency band of\u2009>8\u2009MHz. The cut-off of FNPO of 12 or more or OV\nof\u2009>10\u2009mL should be used when the ultrasound machine of older technology is\nused.  Few studies show that using 3D scan to provide automatic volume calculations of\nantral follicles (e.g. VOCAL\u2122 and SonoAVC\u2122) showed better accuracy 51 \u2013 53 as well as reduced\ninterobserver variation in follicle counts 54 , 55 compared with manual 2D\nmeasurements. Not many studies have attempted to look into the reliability of 3D\nultrasound to estimate the follicular population in polycystic\novaries. 56     \u2013 62 More studies are necessary\nto confirm its importance before its recommendation for routine practice.   Ovarian size  The size of the ovary changes through the reproductive life of a woman with\nslow decline during adulthood and rapid shrinkage during menopause. Ovary\nachieves its maximal size during adolescence. As only small changes in OV\noccur between the age of 20 and 39 years, an age-specific OV cut-off is not\nwarranted.  Histopathological studies show that stromal hypertrophy as well as increased\nfollicular count which reflects PCOM correlates to OV and OA. Rotterdam\ncriteria have set a threshold of OV\u2009>10\u2009mL for diagnosis of PCOM. 63 Women with PCOS have a higher ovarian size compared with normal women\nwho are matched for age and body weight. 63 \u2013 65 There has been several interests in setting a lower cut-off volume\nfor OV including 6.4, 66 6.7, 67 7.0 68 , 69 and 7.5 mL. 64 These different cut-offs could be because of variation in population\ncharacteristics.  OV cut-off\u2009of >10\u2009mL was solely based on the results from various studies,\nwhere the upper limit was defined as either being maximum value of controls\nor 95th percentile of control range. The currently accepted cut-off\u2009of\n>10\u2009cm 3 has a sensitivity of 98.2% and a lower sensitivity\nof 45%, in diagnosing PCOM. 42 It should be noted that OV measurement still holds its place when the\nimage resolution does not allow an accurate AFC.     Other Ultrasound measurements   Ovarian stroma  Only few studies have looked at ovarian stroma as a diagnostic tool for\npolycystic ovaries. Fulghesu and colleagues 70 proposed a cut-off of 0.32 for ratio of stroma to total ovarian size.\nThey suggested that this cut-off value is associated with\nhyperandrogenaemia. It appears that stromal volume and ovarian size\ncorrelate well and hence adding stromal volume to clinical practice does not\nprovide much value.    Ovarian blood flow  To date, there are no homogeneous data confirming the importance of measuring\novarian blood flow to diagnose PCOM. There is also no cut-off values that\nhave been proposed to differentiate PCOM from normal ovaries.     Increased serum AMH concentrations as a marker of PCOM  AMH is a glycoprotein which is produced by granulosa cells of pre-antral and\nantral follicles of the ovary. As serum AMH reflects the antral follicles, a\nsignificantly higher level of AMH is seen in women with PCOS compared with\nnormal women. 71 , 72 There is also a direct correlation between AMH levels and\nultrasound parameters of FNPO and OV. 69 , 73    \u2013 78  Dewailly and colleagues proposed a new adaptation to diagnose PCOS based on FNPO\nand serum AMH levels. They concluded that measuring serum AMH and its elevated\nlevels in PCOS and PCOM could be much more reproducible than FNPO which can show\ninterobserver variation as well as variation from unit to unit. 69 This is if a universally available assay is used. They proposed a\nclassification which takes into consideration previous classification for the\ndiagnosis of PCOS. They used FNPO\u2009>\u200919 and AMH\u2009>\u200935\u2009pmol/L as surrogates\nwhen either oligo/anovulation or androgen excess was missing. 69 This classification is shown in Table 2 .   Table 2.   Diagnosis of PCOS incorporating serum AMH.              Oligo/anovulation  Androgen excess (clinical or biochemical)  FNPO\u2009>\u200919 or AMH\u2009>\u200935\u2009pmol/L\n(5\u2009ng/mL)  Diagnosis      +  +  +/\u2212  PCOS    +  \u2212  +  PCOS    \u2212  +  +  PCOS    \u2212  \u2212  +  PCOM    +  \u2212  \u2212  Idiopathic anovulation    \u2212  +  \u2212  Idiopathic hyperandrogenism        AMH, anti-Mullerian hormone; FNPO, follicular number per ovary; PCOM,\npolycystic ovarian morphology; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.     Overall, 26 different studies looked at AUC-ROC of AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS.\nOf these studies, 21 were in adults and they showed it to be 0.66\u20130.994 where\nthreshold ranges from 10 to 57\u2009pmol/L 80 ; 5 studies were in adolescents where AUC-ROC for diagnosis was 0.5\u20130.88\nwhere threshold ranges from 25 to 44\u2009pmol/L. 79 There is a wide fluctuation in the levels of AMH although we know that\nAMH is significantly higher in women who have PCOS. This could be due to the\nvariation in AMH assays that are used and variation in the population and the\nphenotype of women that were studied.  Many studies that looked at correlation between AMH levels and diagnosis of PCOS\nused Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (DSL) or Immunotech (IOT) assays. These\nassays are not available anymore. Assays which used Gen II kit which have been\nused more recently also need cautious interpretation. The recent new automated\nassays that are used have very little data on them. 80 It is also worth noting that International Federation of Clinical\nChemistry does not provide a standard regarding assay methods. In view of all\nthese caveats, serum AMH value as a surrogate to diagnose PCOM is still not\naccepted. AMH can be a potential surrogate marker for diagnosing PCOM in the\nfuture, provided further research confirms its validation in vast population of\ndifferent backgrounds.     Conclusion  PCOS still remains a controversial topic due to its varied etiology and undetermined\nphenotypic spectrum. The existing diagnostic criteria are those suggested by the NIH\nin 1990, Rotterdam criteria 2003 and AES criteria 2005. Expanding the diagnostic\ncriteria in 2003 was aimed at targeting the different phenotypes that exist. In\n2005, the AES task force accepted the original 1990 NIH criteria along with\nmodifications, considering the 2003 Rotterdam criteria. Despite being in widespread\nglobal use, each diagnostic criterion stems an unresolved controversy as much of the\nevidence is only based on consensus opinion rather than robust evidence. Although\nthere is a clear cut-off for \u2018irregular cycles\u2019 in adults, defining \u2018irregular\ncycles\u2019 in adolescents poses a great controversy. Further longitudinal studies are\nneeded to look at natural history of PCOS and also early predictors in adolescents.\nAssessing hyperandrogenism clinically is highly subjective and further studies are\nneeded to determine the cut-off values for mFG scoring system. There is insufficient\nevidence regarding the best method to use for measurement of androgens. Also, the\nmethods used to measure are of insufficient precision. FNPO, which forms one of the\ndiagnostic criteria, has been well researched. Eleven studies including 2961\nparticipants concluded that an optimal sensitivity and specificity was achieved when\na cut-off of\u2009>19 follicles was used. With OV, 12 studies with 2096 participants\ndid not provide a clear cut-off for the optimal OV with both 5\u20138\u2009cm 3 and\n9\u201310\u2009cm 3 . There is inadequate evidence for the use of other\nultrasound parameters to diagnose PCOS. The use of AMH as a substitute for diagnosis\nof PCOS is hindered by the fact that current assays need improved standardisation.\nThe evidence also does not adequately support the role of AMH currently. In\nconclusion, large scientific and clinical research is needed in this field.",
