    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders and\nreproductive abnormalities among women of reproductive age, with a prevalence\nranging from 5-18% ( Costello et al .,\n2019 ; \u00d6zer et\nal ., 2016 ; Zuo et\nal ., 2016 ). The Rotterdam criteria were created to confirm\ndiagnosis of PCOS in women who have at least two of the following symptoms;\nhyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries and oligo- and/or anovulation ( Broekmans et al ., 2006 ). PCOS\npatients have metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance,\npancreatic beta cell dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, early onset of type 2\ndiabetes, lipid profile disorders, and visceral obesity, all of which affect health\nand fertility ( Rocha et al .,\n2019 ). Other factors such as obesity, lifestyle, and genetic and\nenvironmental factors can contribute to the development of PCOS ( Xie et al ., 2019 ), associated\nwith anovulation, which stimulates excess androgen synthesis and chronic\ninflammation due to ovarian dysfunction ( \u00d6zer et al ., 2016 ). Pro-inflammatory mediators in PCOS\npatients can disrupt insulin release and stimulate the production of androgens\nthrough ovarian theca cells, playing an essential role in inducing hyperandrogenism\n(HA) ( Al-Jefout et al ., 2017 ; Bongrani et al ., 2022 ).\nLow-grade chronic inflammation has emerged as the main cause of long-term adverse\noutcomes in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome ( Rojas et al ., 2014 ).  Recent reports have it that obesity plays a functional role in the pathogenesis of\nPCOS and has an increasing effect on developing metabolic disorders in PCOS\npatients. Approximately 60-70% of PCOS patients have abdominal obesity (AO), even\nnormal-weight PCOS patients have excess visceral obesity and this adipose tissue may\ncontribute to inflammation in these patients ( Al-Jefout et al ., 2017 ; Nasiri et al ., 2015 ). Of course, this information is\nabout abdominal obesity, and information about other indicators of obesity (neck and\narm) with increased inflammation in PCOS patients is not available. AO induces an\ninflammatory response and reproductive disorders in PCOS patients via the secretion\nof inflammatory cytokines and the activation of nuclear factors (NF- kB) ( Ka\u0142u\u017cna et al ., 2020 ). This\nactivation is related to the increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory\nmediators such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) or interleukin-6\n(IL-6) ( Nehir Aytan et al .,\n2016 ). Physiologically, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced during\nfollicular development and are involved in ovulation induction, but long-term\nchronic inflammation can impair follicle development and ultimately cause adverse\nreproductive outcomes ( Boots & Jungheim,\n2015 ; Liu et al .,\n2021 ). It appears that AO as a potential trigger of PCOS greatly\naggravates the pathogenic symptoms ( M\u00f6hlig et al ., 2004 ).  The follicular fluid (FF) and serum of PCOS patients have a high level of\ninflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis\nfactor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( Szczuko et al ., 2016 ). Serum and FF\nconcentrations of TNF-\u03b1 are also elevated in PCOS patients ( Gaafar et al ., 2014 ).\nTNF-\u03b1 is a multifaceted cytokine secreted by macrophages and causes the\nproliferation of granulosa cells and changes in ovarian function ( Gaafar et al ., 2014 ; Prins et al ., 2020 ). This\ncytokine is overexpressed in adipose tissue and causes insulin sensitivity. The\nexpression of this cytokine is increased in obesity and plays an essential role in\ncausing low-grade chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome disorders ( Spritzer et al ., 2015 ).  Considering that AO is a pro-inflammatory phenotype, it seems that it can play a\nsignificant role in exacerbating inflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),\nwhich is a low-grade inflammatory disease, and can help to explain infertility in\nPCOS patients. In the present study, we investigated the specific role of the\nabdominal obesity (AO) phenotype in the occurrence of other obesity indicators (neck\nand arm) and the exacerbation of FF inflammation among PCOS patients. For this\npurpose, pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in the FF samples of\nPCOS patients were evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.    MATERIALS AND METHODS   Patients  The medical ethical committee of the Royan Institute (Tehran, Iran) approved the\nstudy (Ethical code: NO.IR. ACECR.ROYAN.REC.1400.091) and written informed\nconsent was obtained from the patients. Forty patients (25-35 years old) with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm\ninjection (ICSI) with symptoms at least three months have passed since their\nlast ovulation stimulation, body mass index (BMI) >30, without systemic\ninflammatory diseases, diabetes, hypertension ( Solak et al ., 2016 ) and thyroid disorders ( Sniezek & Francis, 2003 ), without\ncontinuous use of anti-inflammatory drugs (at least 6-8 weeks before the start\nof the study) were included in our study. Patients with ovarian hyperstimulation\nsyndrome (OHSS) and poor response to ovarian stimulation were considered as\nexclusion criteria.    Study Design  In this observational cross-sectional study from October 2021 to June 2022, the\nforty patients were referred to the Royan Institute (Tehran, Iran), at the start\nof the IVF/ ICSI cycle and were divided into four groups based on the presence\nof PCOS (diagnosed by the Rotterdam 2004 criteria) or absence of PCOS (normal\noogenesis women with a history of male factor, tubal factor, or egg donation),\nand presence or absence of AO (waist/hip ratio \u2265 0.80):  Group 1: Women with PCOS; with abdominal obesity\n(PCOS + AO + )  Group 2: Women with PCOS; without abdominal obesity (PCOS + AO)  Group 3: Non-PCOS women; with abdominal obesity\n(PCOS - AO + )  Group 4: Non-PCOS women; without abdominal obesity (PCOS - AO).    Ovarian Stimulation  In accordance with the following antagonist protocol, all the study patients were\ntreated with standard controlled ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval.  Before each patient\u2019s entered the cycle, basic information including antral\nfollicle count (AFC), anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), luteinizing hormone\n(LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was evaluated. Controlled ovarian\nstimulation (COS), was started on day 2 or 3 of the cycle to ovulation\ninduction. During the first 6 days of the menstrual cycle, the patients received\nregular, daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of 150 IU of the recombinant human\nfollitropin-b (rFSH) (Puregonw, MSD, Ballerup, Denmark). On day 6, the serial\nvaginal ultrasonography was performed and based on the patient\u2019s ovarian\nresponse when two or three ovarian follicles reached a diameter of \u226513\nmm, patients received daily SC injections containing 0.25 mg of a GnRH\nantagonist (Ganirelix-Orgalutranw; MSD, Ballerup, Denmark). Then ovarian\nstimulation continued with rFSH along with the antagonist until the patients had\nat least more than three follicles with an average diameter of 17-18 mm and E2\nlevels of 1000-3500 pg/mL and the number of follicles on both sides should be\nless than or equal to 15 follicles and not had a risk of OHSS, received an SC\ninjection of 6500IU or 13000 IU dosage of recombinant human chorionic\ngonadotrophin (rhCG) (Ovitrellew; Merk Serono, Hellerup, Denmark) to induce\nfinal oocyte maturation. And patients whose estradiol level was more than 3500\nIU or high-risk patients for OHSS with more than 16 follicles were excluded from\nthe study and GnRH agonists were used for all of them and all were frozen. A\nstandard ultrasonically guided follicular puncture was used to retrieve oocytes\n36 to 38 hours after hCG injection. Subsequently, these patients underwent IVF /\nICSI process.    Collecting Follicular Fluid Sample  Follicular fluid was taken from the dominant follicles (18-24 mm) on the day of\noocyte retrieval. The collected liquid was centrifuged for 15 minutes at a speed\nof 1200 rpm until the follicular cells settled and separated supernatants, and\nthen were filtered (0.22 \u00b5m pore size). All the samples were\nheat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Then the accumulated supernatants were\nkept at -80\u00b0C until biochemical analysis.    Oocyte maturity  Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were retrieved 36 to 38 hours after the injection\nof hCG. The evolution of oocyte quality was performed via morphological\nassessment. The oocytes were graded into two groups: Metaphase II (MII) oocytes\nwith normal morphology (round with a smooth first polar body, dispersed\ncytoplasmic granules, normal perivitelline space, homogeneous fine granularity,\nand zona pellucida thickness (18 \u00b5m)) as good oocytes and those with\nintracytoplasmic (vacuolization, accumulating saccules of smooth endoplasmic\nreticulum, organelle clustering) and/ or extracytoplasmic anomalies (large\nperivitelline space, abnormal and dark zona pellucida, granule in perivitelline\nspace) as fair oocytes.  Fertilization was assessed 17 hours after in vitro fertilization\n(IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Embryos were transferred to\nculture medium up to embryo transfer day.    TNF-\u03b1 Concentration in Follicular Fluid Samples  According to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (CN: KPG-HT-NF-\u03b148; pg/ml; LOT:\nHTNF0422004 Iran); TNF-\u03b1 concentration was quantitatively investigated as\nan inflammatory marker in FF samples in all groups by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assays (ELISA).    Statistical Analysis  Data were reported as mean \u00b1 SD, and the graphs were plotted using the\nGraphPad Prism program (virgin 9). The data were statistically analyzed using\nanalysis of the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, and variances (Two-way ANOVA) followed\nby a post-Tukey test, and a p-value <0.05 was considered a\nsignificant difference.     RESULTS   Clinical and hormonal findings  A total of 40 follicular fluid samples from candidates with and without PCOS, who\nwere undergoing oocyte retrieval for IVF/ICSI before ovarian stimulation and in\nthe clinical laboratory of Royan Institute (Tehran, Iran) were evaluated. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the\nwomen in the four groups of the study. Clinical factors, including age,\nluteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, body mass index, thyroid\nstimulating hormone, and prolactin, did not significantly differ among the four\ngroups ( p> 0.05), but free testosterone (as a biomarker of\nhyperandrogenism) and anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone in\nPCOS + AO + group were significantly higher compared with\nothers ( p <0.001).

DISCUSSION  Metabolic abnormalities such as hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,\nand obesity are often present in PCOS women ( Liu et al., 2022 ). Recent studies have used the\nmeasurement of the waist-to-hip ratio of PCOS patients as a simple, cheap,\nnon-invasive, available method to establish the amount of visceral obesity.\nMeasuring the neck and arm circumference in PCOS patients as an anthropometric\nparameter representing the upper body\u2019s subcutaneous adipose tissue can also be an\ninnovative tool for screening abdominal obesity distribution, which reflects\nabdominal obesity and metabolic disorders ( Liu et al., 2022 ; Yang et al., 2021 ). The results of the present study also\nshow that patients with excessive adiposity (AO) have more upper-body obesity\n(around the neck and arms), which worsens hyperandrogenism. Of course, arm obesity\nwas not significant, probably due to the small sample size in our study, but studies\nwith larger sample sizes need to verify this.  The results of the study show that the TNF-\u03b1 in the FF of PCOS patients with\nAO is significantly higher than in the other groups. This result is consistent with\nseveral other studies that reported high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in\nPCOS patients ( Adams et al., 2016 ; Amato et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Most researchers consider inflammation as a key characteristic in\nPCOS patients and PCOS as a chronic inflammatory disease ( Ghowsi et al ., 2018 ). Although the exact\nmechanism is not fully understood yet, studies have shown that inflammation in these\npatients is caused by an increase in androgen synthesis by the ovary, which by\nstimulating androgen secretion, causes ovarian and adrenal hyperandrogenism ( Repaci et al ., 2011 ). The\nincrease in androgens hinders the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),\nraises blood glucose levels, and leads to the accumulation of fat in the abdominal\narea. Consequently, it disrupts the normal menstrual cycle, interferes with\nfollicular maturation, and contributes to the development of complications\nassociated with PCOS ( Nehir Aytan et\nal ., 2016 ; Rudnicka et al ., 2021 ).  Inflammation resulting from reduced expression of the glucose transporter gene type 4\n(GLUT4) and excessive production of TNF-\u03b1 in adipose tissue leads to insulin\nresistance ( Samy et al .,\n2009 ). The phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS-1) by\nintracellular serine kinases leads to the disruption of signaling events and\ndecreased insulin sensitivity ( Ghowsi et\nal ., 2018 ). In PCOS patients, the balance of\npro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-18 and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-27, IL-35, and IL-37 is disturbed, and the\nlevels of pro-inflammatory cytokines increases dramatically. As a consequence, the\novulation process is disrupted due to the increase in unregulated inflammation,\nleading to infertility ( Ghowsi et\nal ., 2018 ).  The buildup of adipose tissue exacerbates the inflammation seen in these patients\n( Boots & Jungheim, 2015 ). Adipose\ntissue plays a crucial role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, which can\naffect energy consumption, inflammation, and cardiovascular and reproductive\nfunctions. Adipose tissue releases various cytokines, acute phase proteins, and\nother inflammatory mediators, which can have autocrine, paracrine, or systemic\neffects that impact glucose metabolism, energy balance, and proin-flammatory or\nanti-inflammatory activities ( Coelho et\nal ., 2013 ). Abdominal obesity (AO) is prevalent in 38-88% of\nPCOS patients, leading to insulin resistance by inhibiting insulin receptor tyrosine\nkinase in fat muscles ( Or\u00f3stica et\nal ., 2016 ). Obese women with PCOS experience high levels of\nfree testosterone, androgens, insulin resistance, and a relative increase in blood\nsugar compared to women with normal weight, which leads to infertility, frequent\nmiscarriages, menstrual and ovulation abnormalities, type 2 diabetes, high blood\npressure, and implantation problems include decreasing the implantation rate ( Velez et al ., 2021 ).  Hyperandrogenism as an inflammation trigger can be independent of obesity or\nassociated with excessive AO ( Nehir Aytan et\nal ., 2016 ). Studies have shown that hyper-androgenism exists\nin both obese and lean PCOS patients; but obesity, especially AO can increase\nhyperandrogenism ( Mohammadi et al .,\n2017 ; Velez et al .,\n2021 ). Excessive androgens can cause hypertrophy of fat cells, leading to\nhypoxia, production of reactive oxygen species, and fat cell necrosis. In addition,\nfat tissue can activate the nuclear factor NF-\u03baB (an inflammatory factor) by\ninducing oxidative stress and reducing antioxidant capacity, resulting in an\nincrease in inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 ( Velez et al ., 2021 ). There is thus a close\ncorrelation between inflammation, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, and\nPCOS; they are interconnected and reinforce each other through several signaling\npathways ( Thathapudi et al .,\n2014 ).  In conclusion, the buildup of visceral adipose tissue is a crucial factor that\ncontributes to the metabolic syndrome features associated with PCOS and chronic\nlow-grade inflammation ( Mohammadi et\nal ., 2017 ). inflammatory cytokines play an important role in\nthe proliferation of follicular theca cells, in the development of chronic low-grade\ninflammation, cancer, and the regulation of ovarian activity during the menstrual\ncycle. These cytokines are considered to be the primary candidates in molecular\nevents, activation, and regulation of pro-inflammatory cascade in PCOS patients\n( Mohammadi et al .,\n2017 ). Furthermore, excessive production of TNF-\u03b1 by fatty tissue can\ndisrupt insulin function in various cells, including endothelial, epithelial,\nfibroblast, and endometrial tissue, especially in PCOS patients, and impairs their\nreproductive function ( Rostamtabar et\nal ., 2021 ).  In addition to the mild pro-inflammatory environment generated in the endometrium of\nthese women, obesity also creates higher levels of inflammation in the endometrium\nof obese patients with PCOS. The current study showed that the level of TNF-\u03b1\nexpression was highest in PCOS patients with AO compared with other groups,\nconsistent with the results of previous studies. Consequently, the expressions of\ninflammatory factors in the serum and FF of PCOS patients are greatly increased,\ndisrupting the ovulatory process and successful fertility in these patients ( Or\u00f3stica et al .,\n2016 ).  Inflammation plays a key physiological role in folliculogenesis and ovulation, and an\nunperturbed inflammatory response is essential for proper folliculogenesis. Mounting\nevidence suggests that abnormal inflammation can disrupt normal ovarian follicle\ndynamics and result in impaired oocyte quality. Failure to ovulate and decreased\nimplantation can result in infertility ( Boots &\nJungheim, 2015 ).  The findings of the current study show that the pro-inflammatory state of PCOS plays\nan essential role in causing the complications of this disease. In addition, AO\nassociated with PCOS significantly increases inflammatory status and\nhyperandrogenism ( Liu et al .,\n2021 ). The results of our study were consistent with Niu\u2019s finding that\nincreased inflammation in the group of PCOS with AO was associated with a decrease\nin the number of good-quality oocytes ( Niu et al ., 2017 ) ( Figure\n2 ).   Figure 2 The schematic illustration of the association between AO and inflammation\nin PCOS patients in decreasing fertility potential.    The combination of visceral obesity and chronic inflammation in PCOS patients likely\nleads to a disruption of oocyte quality and a significant reduction in fertility in\nobese PCOS women. inflammatory changes in women with PCOS may have a crucial role in\ndrug approaches, treatment response, and metabolic and reproductive impairments in\nwomen with this syndrome.    CONCLUSION  Considering the role of AO in aggravating hyperandrogenism and subsequently\nincreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and inducing inflammation, more patients\nshould be included in the study, and if the same results are repeated, it is\nrecommended that a new therapeutic protocol based on lifestyle improvement\n(including diet therapy, exercise, and weight loss) and pharmacotherapy should be\nselected for these patients before entering the treatment cycle.",
