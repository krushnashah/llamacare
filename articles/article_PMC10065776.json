    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects one in\nevery 15 women worldwide. This disorder is mainly characterized by increased\nlevels of male hormones (androgens), acne, and hirsutism, and can lead to\nlong-term insulin resistance, miscarriage, or even infertility in women.\nPCOS is a disorder that can be treated with natural and allopathic remedies\nthat work against the PCOS mechanism. The present study reviews previous\nstudies on the treatment of PCOS using natural drugs. The data in this study were collected from articles published in reputable\ndatabases including ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, and SID in the\nfield of medicinal plants from 1990 to 2021. A review of the literature showed that plants such as aloe vera and chamomile\nimprove fertility by increasing the number of ovarian follicles. Besides,\nVitex agnus-castus and octane reduce hirsutism by reducing testosterone and\nandrogen levels. It was also shown that liquorice, ginseng, cinnamon, and de\nchiro Inositol improve the adverse effects of diabetes caused by PCOS by\nlowering lipid and blood glucose levels. Moreover, Stachys lavandulifolia\nand fennel are effective in changing endometrial tissue parameters in PCOS\nby reducing estrogen and hyperplasia. Various studies have shown that herbal medicines can improve PCOS symptoms in\nwomen with minimal side effects but a longer treatment cycle.",
    "body": "INTRODUCTION  The therapeutic effects and uses of herbs have been well established. A return to\nnature and the use of drugs of plant and natural origin takes place in a situation\nwhere modern man, by promoting the use of chemical drugs, has faced the side effects\nand complications of these drugs. Scientific studies have demonstrated the\neffectiveness and safety of several complementary medicine methods including herbs\nin the treatment of some diseases ( Rashidi et al., 2012 ).  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in\nwomen. It is a complex disease that, despite the rapid progress in research on it,\nhas remained one of the most important challenges for researchers, physicians,\nhealth care providers, and health policymakers. Women with PCOS generally have large\novaries with hypertrophic stroma. These individuals do not ovulate despite having a\nlarge number of follicles due to impaired growth and atresia of the follicles.\nClinical manifestations of this disease are varied and include menstrual disorders,\nclinical signs of androgen overload, obesity and infertility, hair loss, acne,\ninsulin resistance resulting in type II diabetes, lipid disorder, systemic\ninflammation, oxidative stress, and long-term complications ( Amini et al ., 2015 ). The prevalence of this\ndisease is reported to be 4 to 25%, depending on the definition provided. A national\nstudy reported its prevalence as 14.6% in Iran ( Nasiri Amiri et al ., 2013 ). To this end, the present\nstudy aimed to investigate the effect of natural compounds and medicinal plants\neffective in the treatment of polycystic ovaries.    MEDICINAL PLANTS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF PCOS   Aloe vera  Aloe vera, also known as Aloe arborescens , is a perennial\nherbaceous plant of the Liliaceae family. This plant contains vitamins A, C, and\nE. It also has antioxidant properties induced by reducing the level of lipid\nperoxidation. Aloe vera contains nutrients and minerals, salicylic acid,\nenzymes, tannins, and a variety of polysaccharides. Aloe vera gel contains\nmainly water and polysaccharides (pectins, cellulose, hemicellulose,\nglucomannan, skymann, and mannose derivatives). The active ingredients in the\ngel and leaves of this plant include aloe, asmodin, aloe asmodine, barbaloin,\nand polymonosaccharides such as sterols and organic acids ( Akbar, 2020 ). Polysaccharide compounds in Aloe vera gel are\nable to reduce and repair inflammation. These compounds also have antibacterial\nand antimicrobial properties ( Mezzetti et al ., 2020 ). Aloe vera causes the number of\nprimary germ cells in the ovary to become normal, and as a result, it can have\nbeneficial and supportive effects on ovarian tissue and folliculogenesis ( Yagi, 2015 ).  One study examined the effect of aloe vera gel on PCOS rats. Female rats were\norally fed letrozole for 5 months and no nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors were\nused to induce PCOS. The animals were then treated with 1 ml of aloe vera gel\nfor 45 days. Stress cycle, glucose sensitivity, and steroidogenic activity were\nevaluated in the rats. The results showed that the use of a stimulant\n(letrozole) along with aloe vera gel prevented the development of PCOS in the\nrats. Aloe vera gel formulation has a protective effect against PCOS by\nrestoring ovarian steroid status and altering steroidogenic activity, which can\nbe attributed to plant compounds such as phytosterols and phytophenols in aloe\nvera gel. Aloe vera gel acts directly on key enzymes such as 3\u03b2 HSD,\nreducing enzyme activity and modulating estradiol formation ( Maharjan et al ., 2010 ). In\nanother study evaluating the effect of aloe vera hydroalcoholic extract in the\ntreatment of PCOS in rats, the animals were divided into five groups: control\ngroup, PCOS group (daily intake of 4 mg/kg estradiol valerate intramuscularly),\nand treatment groups 1, 2, and 3, each given respective daily doses of 100, 200\nand 400 mg/kg of yellow aloe extract intraperitoneally, in addition to 4 mg/kg\nof estradiol valerate. Estrogen concentration in the PCOS group increased\nsignificantly compared to the control group and decreased significantly in\ntreatment groups 2 and 3 compared to controls. The concentration of progesterone\nin the PCOS group and all treatment groups had a significant decrease compared\nto the control group. Thus, aloe vera seems to have positive effects on\nfertility and improvement of polycystic ovary syndrome ( Hemayatkhah-Jahromi & Rahmanian-Koushkaki, 2016 ).    Chamomile  Chamomile, with the scientific name of Chamomilla matricaria , is\na perennial plant of the Asteraceae family. Chamomile extract contains flavonoid\ncompounds and antioxidants such as gallic acid, kamazelin, farnesene, matricin,\ncoumarin derivatives, apigenin, and choline, which have special\nanti-inflammatory effects ( Srivastava et\nal ., 2009 ). The antispasmodic effects of chamomile\nreduce menstrual cramps and the risk of preterm labor in women. Chamomile is\nused to treat skin complications and eczema due to its stimulating effect on\nleukocytes (macrophages and B lymphocytes) ( McKay & Blumberg, 2006 ; Farideh et al ., 2010 ).  To determine the effect of chamomile on PCOS, 30 adult Wistar rats were studied.\nThe animals were divided into two groups: The first group was the control group\nand PCP was induced in the second group by injecting estradiol valerate. The\nPCOS rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections of chamomile alcoholic\nextract for ten days at different doses (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg). The results of\ntissue and hormonal tests showed that chamomile could reduce the PCOS symptoms\nin ovarian tissue and increase the number of uterine follicles, as well as\nimprove LH secretion ( Farideh et\nal ., 2010 ).    Chaste tree  Chaste tree, with the scientific name Vitex agnus-castus L,\nbelongs to the Verbenaceae family. The most important chemical compounds in the\nwoody limbs, leaves, and fruits of the Vitex agnus-castus are\niridoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and steroids. Flavonoids are the\nmain constituents of different parts of this plant ( Russo & Galletti, 1996 ). Vitex\nagnus-castus extract has anti-inflammatory and wound healing\neffects ( Sarma et al .,\n1990 ). The essential oil of its leaves has antimicrobial activity on\ngram-positive and negative bacteria ( Russo &\nGalletti, 1996 ). The extract of this plant corrects high\nestrogen-dependent hormonal imbalance or premenstrual syndrome and reduces the\nassociated symptoms ( Reynolds, 1996 ). The\nextract of the Vitex agnus-castus changes the amount of sex\nhormones and their balance. The plant extract also affects the balance of\nhormones, changing the estrone-to-progesterone ratio, making progesterone from\nestrogen ( Russo & Galletti, 1996 ). Vitex agnus-castus extract can improve the status of these\nhormones in polycystic animals by altering the secretion of sex hormones.  A total of 93 women who were planning to become pregnant in the next 6-36 months\nwere divided into two groups: a control group and a group that underwent a\ndietary treatment with Vitex agnus-castus extract, vitamins,\nand minerals. After 3 months, progesterone levels increased in the early luteal\nphase in the women and menstrual periods returned to normal. Fourteen of the 53\nwomen who received the supplementary diet became pregnant, while 4 of the 40\nwomen in the control group became pregnant. The recommended dose was 500-1000 mg\nof dried plant ( Westphal et\nal ., 2006 ). In a study on the effect of hydroalcoholic\nextract of Vitex agnus-castus fruit on changes in sex hormones\non PCOS in Sprague Dawley rats, the animals were divided into four groups: a\ncontrol group, a treatment group (receiving plant extract at a dose of 365 kg/mg\nfor 30 days), a PCOS group (to induce PCOS using 1 kg/mg letrozole for 28 days),\nand a PCT group (treated orally with plant extract for 30 days after the PCOS\ninduction). The results showed that after administration of letrozole, estrogen\nand progesterone levels decreased in the PCOS group, but testosterone and DHEA\nlevels increased. Vitex agnus-castus extract in the treatment\ncontrol group did not cause significant changes in the evaluated hormones.\nAdministration of the extract of this plant increased the serum level of\nprogesterone and decreased testosterone in the animals with PCOS, but did not\naffect the estradiol and DHEA levels. The plant extract may also increase the\nactivity of the aromatase enzyme and reduce testosterone levels by aromatizing\ntestosterone and converting it to estradiol.    Cinnamon  Cinnamon, also called Cinnamomum zeylanicum , belongs to the\nLauraceae family. This plant is one of the oldest and most important herbal\nmedicines used in traditional medicine. Different parts of this plant, including\nits skin, have many healing properties. The medicinal value of this plant is\nmostly due to its volatile oil. The main constituents of this essential oil,\nincluding cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and safrole, have insulin-like activity\n( Singh et al .,\n2007 ). Cinnamon extract increases glucose uptake and glycogen production\nand increases insulin receptor phosphorylation, increasing insulin sensitivity\n( Uslu et al ., 2018 ).\nCinnamon reduces blood fat and glucose levels ( Sheng et al ., 2008 ) and prevents the oxidation of\norganic matter in the body and the reduction of free radicals due to its strong\nantioxidant properties ( Saei Ghare Naz &\nRamezani Tehrani, 2021 ). In addition, in lowering blood sugar and\nblood lipids, cinnamon can be useful for regulating the menstrual cycle and\nimproving gynecological problems, and breathing and digestive disorders ( Heshmati et al .,\n2021 ).  In one study, 15 women with PCOS took 333 mg of cinnamon extract as oral capsules\nthree times a day for 8 weeks. Insulin sensitivity tests were performed on the\npatients before and after the administration of cinnamon extract. The results\nshowed a significant reduction in insulin in the patients 2 hours after\ningestion of cinnamon extract. Cinnamon decreased insulin in patients by\nincreasing phosphatidylinvestyl 4-kinase activity ( Wang et al ., 2007 ).    Ginseng  Ginseng, with the scientific name of Panax ginseng , is a\nfragrant and durable medicinal plant belonging to the genus Panax and the\nAraliaceae family. This plant has high antioxidant properties and increases the\nbody\u2019s resistance ( Helms, 2004 ). The\nantioxidant properties of ginseng are induced by stimulating the activity of\nantioxidant enzymes such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Due to its\nantioxidant activity, this plant can eliminate superoxide and also prevents\nlipid peroxidation in cell membranes by inhibiting the activity of hydroxyl\nradicals and anions ( Attele et\nal ., 1999 ). This formulation significantly reduces\nplasma LH levels and is thus effective in improving endocrine status in the\ntreatment of ovulation disorders in patients with PCOS ( Andhalkar et al ., 2021 ).  A study examined the effect of ginseng on Sprague Dawley rats with PCOS induced\nby intramuscular injection of estradiol. The animals were divided into three\ngroups: a control group (estradiol injection), an estradiol injection and\nginseng treatment group, and an oil treatment group. Nerve growth factor (NGF)\nand ovarian morphology were studied in the animals. The results showed that in\nanimals with PCOS, NGF increased in the ovaries and brain, and ginseng decreased\nNGF ( Pak et al ., 2005 ).\nIn another study, 50 adult rats were divided into a control group, a PCOS group\n(letrozole treatment), and 3 treatment groups receiving metformin (500 mg/kg),\nginseng extract (500 mg/kg), and metformin with ginseng. Administrations were\ndone by gavage for 28 days. Letrozole alone was found to cause a significant\nincrease in serum levels of testosterone, LH, number of cystic follicles, and\nbody weight, and a significant decrease in the amount of estrogen, progesterone,\nand ovarian follicles compared to the control group. However, in\nletrozole-treated rats, metformin and ginseng alone and together prevented the\neffect of letrozole on the serum levels of estrogen and progesterone,\ntestosterone, LH, ovarian and cystic follicles. The difference between the\neffect of metformin and ginseng was not significant ( Shabani & Hosseini, 2017 ).    Stachys lavandulifolia  Stachys, with the scientific name of Stachys lavandulifolia ,\nbelongs to the Lamiaceae family. This plant induces menstruation, is abortive,\nreduces the duration and severity of primary dysmenorrhea pain, and is a\nrheumatic analgesic. Chemical analysis of Stachys lavandulifolia plant shows\nthat this plant contains flavonoids, ethanoids, trenapenoids, saponins, quinine,\niridoids, phenolic acids, and diterpenoids. Other compounds of the plant are\nMyrsen (20%), Agnol (18%), Alpha Pyogenin (13.2%), and Gamma Morolen (7%) ( Kolivand et al ., 2017 ).\nFlavonoid apigenin, one of the compounds in this plant, is an estrogen present\nin aromatic plants. Although this compound is less active than its isoflavonoid\nhomologues, its estrogenic properties have been proven. The estrogenic compounds\nin Stachys lavandulifolia extract occupy estrogen receptors and\nreduce estrogen function ( Pahlevani et\nal ., 2016 ).  In a 2013 study, 66 patients with PCOS were randomly divided into two groups. The\npatients in the intervention group (n=33) were treated with Stachys\nlavandulifolia brewed tea three times a day (5 g each time) for\nthree months. The patients in the control group received medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (MPA) at a dose of 10 mg per night for 10 nights a month for three\nmonths. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of abnormal\nuterine bleeding (AUB) in both groups. The prevalence of side effects was lower\nin the intervention group compared to the control group. However, this\ndifference was not significant. Therefore, it was concluded that Stachys\nlavandulifolia could be used as an alternative to MPA in the\nmanagement of PCOS-induced AUB ( Jalilian et al ., 2013 ).  The effect of Stachys lavandulifolia extract on endometrial\nhistological parameters of the PCOS model of Sprague Dawley rats was\ninvestigated. PCOS was induced by estradiol valerate at a dose of 4 mg via\nintramuscular injections in the animals. The animals were divided into 6 groups:\na control group without drug, a PCOS group receiving the solvent drug, a PCOS\ngroup receiving Stachys lavandulifolia extract (225, 450, and\n900 mg/kg), and PCOS groups receiving clomiphene citrate (1.5 mg/kg). The\nextract was injected intraperitoneally to the tested rats for 4 estrus cycles\n(16 days). The rats in the PCOS group showed an increase in the height of\nendometrial epithelial cells and glandular epithelial cells and a decrease in\nendometrial thickness and inner diameter of the glands, although these changes\nwere not significant. However, parameter number of glands in the PCOS group\nshowed a significant decrease. In addition, hyperplastic changes were seen in\n40% of rats in the PCOS group. Treatment with Stachys\nlavandulifolia with different concentrations and clomiphene citrate\nbrought the variables of endometrial epithelial cell height, endometrial\nthickness, glandular epithelial cell height, endothelial diameter, and the\nnumber of glands closer to the control group, but these changes were not\nsignificant. Treatment with a concentration of 900 kg/kg of Stachys\nlavandulifolia and clomiphene reduced hyperplasia in 35% and 33.3%\nof the animals, respectively. Therefore, Stachys lavandulifolia extract is effective in changing endometrial tissue parameters in PCOS ( Pahlevani et al .,\n2016 ).    Fennel  Fennel, with the scientific name of Foeniculum vulgare , is an\nherbaceous plant from the Apiaceae family. Fennel is known as an estrogenic\ncompound and is used in traditional medicine to treat many digestive, endocrine,\nreproductive, and menstrual disorders. Fennel and its compounds have\nantibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antithrombotic, anti-diabetic, and\nanti-tumor activity ( Ghavi et\nal ., 2019 ). The most important and abundant compound in\nfennel is a substance called Trans anethole, which has been introduced as an\nestrogenic active agent. Other aromatic compounds in fennel such as dianethole,\nphotoanethole, estrogole, fenchine, and p-anisaldehyde act as estrogenic\nbiologically active molecules ( Parandin &\nYousofvand, 2018 ).  The effect of metformin and fennel on uterine tissue and serum concentrations of\nestrogen and progesterone was investigated in rats with PCOS. A total of 40\nfemale rats were divided into 5 groups: (1) a control group (receiving normal\nwater and food), (2) a PCOS group (induction of PCOS by intramuscular injection\nof estradiol valrite at 4 mg/kg body weight), (3) a PCOS group treated with\nfennel at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight after induction of polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, (4) a PCOS group treated with fennel at a dose of 100 mg/kg body\nweight after PCOS induction, and (5) a PCOS group treated with metformin at a\ndose of 111 mg/kg body weight. After a 63-day treatment period, blood samples\nwere taken from all rats for biochemical analysis, and their uterine tissue was\nremoved for histological studies. The results showed that fennel decreased\nestrogen, uterine epithelial thickness, and increased progesterone and uterine\nendometrial thickness in PCOS rats. Therefore, fennel can have a protective\neffect on the uterine tissue of rats with PCOS ( Meena et al ., 2019 ; Sadr Fozalaee et al ., 2015 ).    Licorice  Licorice, with the scientific name of Glycyrrhiza glabra L,\nbelongs to the Fabaceae family, which is used in traditional medicine for wound\nhealing, pain relief, cough, and gastritis relief. This plant is important\nbecause it contains important medicinal compounds in its roots, including\nflavonoids, sterols, gums, starches, and essential oils. Sterols or\nphytoestrogens can lower triglycerides and cholesterol. The main active\ningredient in licorice root is glycerin, which is 50 times sweeter than sucrose.\nResearch has shown that glycerin has a mineralocorticoid-like effect by\ninhibiting the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11betaHSD2) enzyme.\nBy inhibiting the metabolism of glucocorticoids, their levels in blood increase.\nFurthermore, glucocorticoids stimulate insulin secretion and thus lower blood\nsugar ( Andhalkar et al .,\n2021 ; Barazesh et\nal ., 2016 ; El-Saber Batiha et al ., 2020 ).  The effects of administration of licorice root hydroalcoholic extract on blood\nsugar, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels were investigated in 50 Sprague rats\nwith polycystic ovary syndrome. The studied groups were: a normal group\nreceiving letrozole normal saline (2 ml/kg) orally daily for 21 days, a\nletrozole group that received letrozole (1 mg/kg) orally for 21 days followed by\nnormal saline (2 ml/kg) orally daily for 30 days, and treatment groups 1 and 2\nreceiving letrozole (1 mg/kg) orally for 21 days, and then licorice root\nhydroalcoholic extract (200 and 400 mg/kg), respectively, daily for 30 days. The\nresults showed that the mean serum glucose level in the letrozole group\nincreased compared to the normal group ( p <0.01) and\ndecreased in treatment groups 1 and 2 compared to the letrozole group\n( p >0.05). The mean serum triglyceride and cholesterol\nlevels did not show a significant difference in the studied groups. Therefore,\nlicorice root extract improves the adverse effects of diabetes due to polycystic\novary syndrome ( Barazesh et al .,\n2016 ).    Flax  Flax, with the scientific name Limum usitatissimum , belongs to\nthe Linaceae family ( Zohary et\nal ., 2012 ). Flaxseed is rich in fat, protein, and fiber\nin the diet. Flaxseed contains on average 30-40% fat, 20-25% protein, 20-28%\nfiber, 4-8% moisture, and 3-4% ash, vitamins A, B, D, E, minerals, and amino\nacid ( Oomah & Mazza, 1997 ). Flaxseed\noil is rich in linolenic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, lignans, and mucilage ( Foster et al ., 2009 ). The\nconcentration of \u03b1-linolenic acid (omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid) as an\nanti-cancer agent in flaxseed oil is about 40-60% ( Williams et al ., 2007 ). Flaxseed has\nantifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties ( Kitts et al ., 1999 ) and is a rich source\nof lignans with antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects ( Newairy & Abdou, 2009 ). Flaxseed contains about 27\ntypes of cancer inhibitors including SDG and Matairsinol ( Jenab & Thompson, 1996 ).  Flax seed is rich in lignans, and studies have shown that it lowers androgen\nlevels in men with prostate cancer. Androgen in the body is increased due to\npolycystic ovaries and is associated with hirsutism, menstrual disorders, and\nobesity. A study examined the effect of flaxseed taken as an oral supplement 30\ngrams per day on hormone levels in a 31-year-old woman with PCOS. Over 4 months,\nthe patient took a supplement containing 83% of the flaxseed dose. Height,\nweight, and fasting blood samples were assessed at the beginning and after 4\nmonths of follow-up. The results were reported pairwise: BMI (36\nm/kg 2  vs . 35.7 m/kg 2 ), insulin (5.1 \u00b5IU/ml vs . 7 \u00b5IU/ml), total serum testosterone (150 ng/dl vs . 45 ng/dl), free serum testosterone (4.7 ng/dl vs . 0.5 ng/dl), and percentage of free testosterone (3.1% vs . 1.1%). The results showed a significant decrease in\nbody mass index, insulin, serum testosterone, and free serum testosterone. The\npatient also reported a reduction in hirsutism at the end of the period, and\nandrogen levels decreased with decreasing hirsutism ( Emam et al ., 2021 ; Nowak et al ., 2007 ).    N-acetylcysteine  N-acetylcysteine is an amino acid derived from cysteine and is the acetylated\nform of both the amino acid L-cysteine and the reduced form of glutathione. It\ncan stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic cells as well as regulate\ninsulin receptors at the erythrocyte level. It is also a powerful antioxidant\ncompound and a potential agent in the treatment of cancer and other diseases\nassociated with oxidative stress. The main activity of N-acetylcysteine is due\nto the sulfhydryl group that can increase the activity of the\nglutathione-S-transfer enzyme and protect the cell and its membrane against\noxidative agents. It can also cleanse and detoxify cells and reduce serum\nhomocysteine levels. N-acetylcysteine can be used as a supplement to increase\nfertility, improve ovulation, and improve lipid profile and insulin resistance\nin women with PCOS ( Behrouzi Lak et\nal ., 2017 ; Shirani et al ., 2019 ).  A clinical trial included 108 women with PCOS randomly divided into two groups,\ntaking metformin or N-acetylcysteine. Eight weeks after the start of the study,\nthe variables between the two groups showed no significant change, but after 12\nweeks, the effect of N-acetylcysteine was significantly higher in hirsutism and\nblood sugar levels than metformin. Besides, after the first and second cycles,\nthe rate of ovulation and pregnancy was higher in the women in the\nN-acetylcysteine receptor group than in the women in the metformin receptor\ngroup. Overall, in comparison with metformin, administration of N-acetylcysteine\nas a supplement to clomiphene citrate can improve the hormonal profile and\nhyperinsulinemia and regulate homocysteine ( Nemati et al ., 2017 ).    D-chiro-inositol  D-chiro-inositol (DCI) is produced from the decomposition of phytic acids in\nfruits, legumes, nuts, and grains ( Watson,\n2011 ). Inositols are involved in a variety of functions, including\ncell membrane formation, cell growth and survival (morphogenesis, rearrangement\nof cytoskeleton, and regulation of cell proliferation), intracellular signaling,\nperipheral nerve development and function, ossification, and reproduction ( Januszewski et al., 2019 ).\nD-chiro-inositol can improve regular menstruation and insulin resistance in PCOS\npatients ( Nordio & Proietti,\n2012 ).  In one study, 44 obese women with PCOS were selected and their serum and glucose\nsteroids tested before and after oral administration of 1,200 mg\nD-chiro-inositol per day for 6 to 8 weeks, and serum progesterone concentrations\nwere evaluated weekly. Ovulation was also measured. The results showed that\nserum-free testosterone, plasma triglyceride levels, and blood pressure\ndecreased in 19 of the 22 women who received D-chiro-inositol ( Nestler et al ., 1999 ). In\nanother study, women with PCOS who had insulin resistance were treated with\nmyoinositol and D-chiro-inositol, and combination therapy with both substances.\nThe results showed that after three months, combination therapy with myoinositol\nand D-chiro-inositol was more effective in reducing PCOS and the risk of\nmetabolic syndrome in overweight women ( Nordio\n& Proietti, 2012 ). Significant reduction in body weight, FSH, LH,\nand plasma insulin concentration was observed after 3 and 6 months following\ntreatment with D-chiro-inositol ( Januszewski et al ., 2019 ).     CONCLUSION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that leads to female\ninfertility. Various studies have shown that herbal medicines with minimal side\neffects play an important role in the treatment of PCOS, although more time is\nrequired to treat PCOS with herbal medicines. The effect of herbs in the treatment\nof PCOS can be attributed to the strengthening of the immune system and the\nregulation of the menstrual cycle without changes in hormonal levels.
