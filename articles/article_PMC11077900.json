    "body": "We would like to thank Drs. Ibanez and de Zegher for their comments on our recent manuscript\npublished in Journal of the Endocrine Society [ 1 , 2 ]. We agree that\nthere is opportunity for such observations to translate to a more personalized approach to\ntherapy in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We would like to recognize the\nsignificant contributions Drs. Ibanez and de Zegher have made to the field of metabolic\nmechanisms and novel treatment approaches in adolescent PCOS.  We would caution readers against drawing conclusions regarding the prevalence of obesity in\nadolescents with PCOS based on the prevalence we report in our cohort. The CALICO database is\nnot a population-based study but rather a retrospective database of clinical data from a\nnumber of academic medical centers across the United States. In fact, many of the patients\nincluded in CALICO received care in multidisciplinary PCOS clinics, which often have clinical\nsupport from dieticians and obesity medicine providers and specifically draw patients with\nobesity or other metabolic complications of PCOS. Therefore, we suspect the prevalence of\nobesity reported in our cohort significantly overestimates the population prevalence.  In terms of birthweight and its potential association with PCOS in our cohort, we had\nbirthweight data available on 40 lean girls and 170 girls with obesity. There was a trend\ntoward lower birth weight in the lean girls that did not reach statistical significance (lean\ngirls 3.11 \u00b1 0.57 vs obese girls 3.31 \u00b1 0.62, kg, P = .07). Nine of the 40\nlean girls had a birth weight of less than 2.8\u2005kg, which is 10th percentile for a 40-week\ninfant girl based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Unfortunately,\nour database does not include gestational age, so we are unable to conclusively state the\nprevalence of small for gestational age status in this cohort.  In terms of treatment, we agree that therapies targeting the distinct mechanisms of PCOS\nwould be the best approach, rather than a global recommendation for combination oral\ncontraceptive pills as first-line therapy for all patients [ 3 ]. In fact, retrospective analysis of differential responses to a\nnumber of treatment approaches is a goal of our current grant funding the CALICO project\n(1R21HD109488). We hope preliminary data collected in this effort will allow for more\nprospective studies investigating individualized therapies based on distinct mechanisms,\nincluding ectopic fat and insulin resistance, which may result in the common PCOS end\nphenotype.
