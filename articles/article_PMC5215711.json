    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal imbalance disorder ( 1 , 2 ) that occurs in approximately 4-18% of reproductive-aged women (12 to\n45 years) ( 3 ). PCOS is a metabolic and reproductive\ndisorder with characteristic features that include hyperandrogenism, irregular menstrual cycles, insulin\nresistance, obesity, hirsutism, and acne ( 4 ). Anovulation that results from PCOS is the most common\ncause of infertility in women ( 5 ). Features of PCOS\nmay manifest at any age and range from childhood\n(premature puberty), teenage (hirsutism, menstrual\nabnormalities), early adulthood and middle life (infertility, glucose intolerance), to later life (diabetes\nmellitus and cardiovascular diseases) ( 6 ).  Numerous evidences affirm the fact that endocrinologic and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS\nmay have complex effects on endometrial tissue,\nthus contributing to infertility and endometrial disorders in women with this syndrome ( 7 ). Long-term\nPCOS increases the risk of hyperplasia, endometrial cancer (EC), and metabolic syndrome ( 8 ). Endometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant condition\nthat usually heralds EC ( 9 ). It has been reported\nthat women with PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia have a four times greater risk of developing EC\nthan women without PCOS ( 10 ). Hyperplasia and\nuterine cancer have been observed in women with PCOS who received no treatment ( 11 ).  The two main types of EC are estrogen-dependent\ntype \u0399 and estrogen-independent type \u0399\u0399 ( 12 ). It is\nwidely believed that PCOS is one of the most impressive risk factors that promote type I EC ( 10 , 13 , 14 ). Prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen, as a consequence of anovulation, is suggested to be the prime cause of this increased risk ( 15 ).\nTherefore, the hormonal imbalance associated with\nPCOS can alter endometrial tissue homeostasis and\npromote cell proliferation ( 16 ). In humans, continuous exposure of the endometrium to estrogen can\nlead to endometrial hyperplasia ( 17 ). Progesterone\nacts as a protective factor against estrogen-driven\nuterine growth and proliferation ( 18 ).  Steroid hormone levels regulate the cycle of cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the endometrial\ntissue. Therefore, a firm balance between these\ntwo processes would secure the normal function of\nthe endometrium ( 19 ). Endocrine-metabolic situations associated with abnormalities in plasma hormone concentrations, as seen with PCOS, can affect the processes that occur in the endometrium,\nwhich includes cell proliferation, differentiation\nand response to biological stimuli ( 20 ). Estrogen\nis a hormone that affects the uterus. Strong activation of proliferative activity is the most important\nphysiological effect of estrogen hormones in the\nuterus ( 21 ). Significant consequences of (particularly long-term) endometrial exposure to estrogen\nare morphogenetic alterations that include modified\ntype of luminal and glandular epithelia, glandular\nshape, and the glandular to stromal ratio ( 22 , 23 ).  Estradiol valerate (EV) is used to create PCOS\nby inducing hormone abnormalities ( 24 ). EV,\nwhich is introduced as a prodrug, is an ester derived from 17\u03b2-estradiol. EV is normally cleared\nin blood plasma and the liver into 17\u03b2-estradiol\nby esterase activity ( 25 ). The 17\u03b2-estradiol metabolizing procedure includes an array of reversible and non-reversible enzyme-mediated reactions ( 26 ). The metabolites 17\u03b2-estradiol and\nestron may predict the risk of breast ( 27 ) and other hormone-related cancers ( 28 ). Studies show\nthat hormonal abnormalities attributed to EV can\ncreate a phenotype similar to PCOS ( 29 ). In this\nstudy we focus on tissue changes and proliferation activity of the uterus in a rat model of PCOS\ninduced by EV.    Materials and Methods   Animals  The present experimental study used 18 adult female\nWistar rats that weighed 200 \u00b1 20 g. Animals were\nobtained from the Pharmacology Department of Tehran University and maintained in special cages under\nstandard conditions of 22\u00baC, a 12-hour dark/light cycle, and free access standard chow and water. In order\nto conduct a comparative evaluation, we divided the\nrats into three groups of 6 animals per group: control\n(normal rats), experimental group or PCOS (rats that\nreceived EV), and sham (rats that received EV solvent). Before the induction, we confirmed the rats\u2019\nnormal estrous cycles through daily vaginal smears\nover two weeks. Animals that had at least two normal\nestrus cycles were selected for PCOS induction.  The Ethics Committee of the Biological Sciences Faculty at Kharazmi University, Tehran, Iran\napproved this study.    Induction of polycystic ovary syndrome  We used EV to induce the polycystic condition.\nEach experimental rat received 2 mg of EV, dissolved in 0.2 ml sesame oil, through a single subcutaneous injection at the inguinal region. Rats in\nthe sham group received an equal volume of sesame oil. Subsequently, vaginal smears of these rats\nwere monitored for 60 days, until the time when\nabnormal estrus cycles and persistent vaginal\ncornification (PVC) occurred as a sign of the presence of ovarian cysts and early confirmation of\nPCOS induction ( 30 ). Rats in the sham group that\nreceived sesame oil showed no evidence of abnormalities in estrus cycles or vaginal smears. Hence,\nfurther experiments were concentrated mainly on\ncontrol and PCOS rats.    Histological and cytological studies  On the 60 th day after the EV injection, rats from\nall groups were sacrificed and the uterine specimens were fixed in 10% formaldehyde. The tissue\nsamples were dehydrated by graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, then sectioned into 5-7\n\u00b5m sections prior to microscopic analysis.    Histological evaluations of the uterus and\ndetermination of mitosis  As mentioned, the effect of estrogens on the uterus tissue is chiefly related to its strong invigorating impact on cell proliferation. Long-term exposure to estrogen leads to uterus endometrium overgrowth and\nhyperplasia. We used hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)\nin addition to iron hematoxylin (iron-H) staining to\nconduct in-depth assessments of histological changes, the occurrence of mitosis, and proliferating cells.  For histological evaluations, tissue sections were\nstained with H&E. We measured the height of the\nepithelial cells, uterus wall thickness, accumulation of uterine glands, and the number of eosinophil cells in the uterine stroma as visualized by a\nlight microscope at \u00d7100, \u00d7400, and \u00d71000 magnifications. The longitudinal measurements were\nobtained by Microstructure Measurement software\nver.1.04 (Scalor, Crop Toky, Japan).  For iron-H staining, we stained the tissue sections with Heidenhain\u2019s iron hematoxylin color. In\nthis hematoxylin solution, iron salts are used both\nas an oxidizer and a mordant. This staining method\ncan be used to demonstrate numerous structures,\nsuch as nuclear chromatin, according to the degree\nof differentiation ( 31 ). This staining method shows\nthe presence of cells during the mitotic cycle. In\norder to measure the percentage ratio of proliferating cells to the total number of epithelial cells, we\nseparately counted both the total and mitotic cell\nnumbers in the uterus luminal and glandular epithelia in 10 microscopic fields of view for each tissue specimen at \u00d71000 magnification with a light\nmicroscope. Overall, we assessed 4359 cells.    Statistical analysis  Comparative assessments of the aforementioned\nparameters are reported as mean \u00b1 SE. Assessment\nbetween PCOS and the control group was performed\nthrough one-way ANOVA (Tukey post hoctest) by\nSPSS Statistics software ver. 20.0 (IBM), at \u03b1=0.05.\nCharts were drawn with Excel software.     Results   Histology of the uterus  Microscopic study of the uterine tissue in the\ngroup treated by EV (PCOS) showed an increase\nin luminal epithelium height, accumulation of endometrial glands and their luminal diameter, and\nalso the number of eosinophils in the endometrial\nstroma ( Fig .1 ). Statistical comparison among the\ngroups also revealed that luminal epithelium height\nand the thickness of the uterine wall in the PCOS\ngroup increased significantly compared to the control group ( Fig .2A, B , Table 1 ). In addition, the percentage of eosinophils significantly increased in the\nexperimental group ( Fig .2C , Table 1 ).

Researchers have reported that eosinophilic infiltration\nmay be under the control of different hormones in rats.\nEosinophilic infiltration is dependent upon the continued presence of elevated levels\nof estrogen in the blood and 17\u03b2-estradiol stimulates eosinophilic invasion ( 32 ). Therefore, in the\npresent study, we have documented changes in the\nnumbers of eosinophils after the injection of EV as\na hormonal mechanism.    Proliferation  We examined and counted the epithelial cells\nin order to assess the frequency of mitotic cells\nin uterine luminal and glandular epithelia among\nthe samples stained with iron-H. The numbers\nof mitotic cells were compared to the total\nnumbers of epithelial cells. We assessed a total\nnumber of 2164 cells in the uterine luminal and\n2195 cells in the glandular epithelia. A comparison between the groups revealed that the PCOS\ngroup had a nonsignificant increase in percentage of mitotic epithelial cells in the luminal region ( Fig .3A , Table 2 ). On the other hand, the\npercentage of mitotic cells increased significantly in its glandular counterpart ( Fig .3B , Table 2 ).\nAnimals that received EV had remarkably more\nmitotic cells compared to animals in the control\ngroup ( Fig .3C, D ).   Table 2   Percentage of mitotic cells in luminal and glandular\nepithelia in control and estradiol valerate (EV)-treated polycystic\novary syndrome (PCOS) rats           Group  Luminal epithelium (%)  Glandular epithelium (%)         Control  0.97 \u00b1 0.49  0.00 \u00b1 0.00    PCOS  1.82 \u00b1 0.67  9.86 \u00b1 3.53*            Values are mean \u00b1 SE. *; P<0.001.     It can be concluded that, as a sign of proliferation, the increase in numbers of mitotic cells leads\nto the development of a uterus with a thicker wall\nand dilated glands. This result can be considered\nas an overture for hyperplasia.   Fig.2   Statistical comparison between control and estradiol valerate (EV)-treated polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rats. A.

Histological observations of uterine tissue sections showed\na statistically reasonable increase in wall thickness\nof the uterus of EV treated (PCOS) rats in comparison with the control group. There was a significant\nrise in the average of the height of epithelial cells\nin PCOS rats compared to normal control rats. It\nhas been shown that estrogen mediated stimulation\nof the uterus results in morphogenetic changes that\ninclude alterations in the type and morphology of\nluminal and glandular epithelia ( 24 , 25 ). Similarly,\nthe current study has proven that the stromal uterine glands of PCOS rats have larger luminal space\nand higher accumulation. In vitro studies of radiothymidine uptake by endometrium suggest that the\nmaximal proliferation in uterine glands and stroma\nis chiefly associated with high concentrations of\nestradiol ( 33 ) and that ovarian steroids are among\nthe most significant factors that affect both morphology and motility of the uterus ( 34 ). The results of this study have also supported the idea that\nnoticeable changes in the epithelial surface, gland\naccumulation, and overall thickness of the uterus\nwall due to an abnormality at the level of ovarian\nsteroids.  Based on the results, we observed a significantly higher eosinophil quantity in the endometrial stroma in the experimental group compared\nto the control rats. Experiments on the effect of\nhormonal perturbations on reproductive tissues\nsuggested that the leukocyte invasion into these\ntissues have mainly occurred under hormone control. Eosinophil invasion is related to the continued\npresence of elevated blood estrogen levels as it is\nstimulated by estrogen ( 35 ). It has been reported\nthat the immune system and inflammation are involved in the pathophysiological process of PCOS ( 36 ). Additionally, polymorphonuclear leukocyte\ninfiltration may be relevant to an immunological\nprocess ( 37 ).  Results of the changes in proliferative activity\nin various regions of the uterus tissue showed a\nhigher percentage of mitotic cells in luminal and\nglandular epithelia among rats of the experimental\n(PCOS) group compared to control rats. Estrogen\nhas been well recognized as a strong factor which\nintensifies the proliferative activity of the uterus,\nwith its major impact on uterine tissue ( 38 , 39 ).\nThe maximal proliferation in uterine glands and\nstroma occurs in the presence of high levels of estradiol ( 36 ). Studies have shown that the mitotic\nactivity of estrogen in the endometrium of rodents\nis restricted to the luminal and gland neck epithelia ( 40 , 41 ). In response to estrogen injection into\novariectomized mice, mitotic activity is first observed in the luminal, followed by the glandular\nregion, while progesterone application can inhibit\nthe mitotic response ( 42 ). Luminal epithelia have\nbeen suggested to undergo proliferation in the\npresence of 17\u03b2-estradiol ( 43 , 44 ). In this study,\nwe have shown that while mitotic activity was,\nto some extent, elevated in luminal epithelia in\nPCOS rats that received EV, this was not a statistically significant finding compared to the control\ngroup. We found that EV administration in PCOS\nrats had a surge in mitotic proliferation in the uterine glandular epithelia, which provided a probable\nexplanation for the enlarged glands and thickened\nuteri wall.  Increased estrogenic environment may favor mitogenic activity in the breast and/or other reproductive tissues ( 45 , 46 ). Estrogens lead to a reduction\nin the duration of all the stages of the cell cycle\nand drive cells from the G0 to the G1-phase; this is\nfollowed by an increase in the number of cells in\npassing the G1-and S- phases, as well as the quantity of dividing cells ( 47 - 49 ). Hyperplasia is an early response to an abnormal stimulation in the cell\nproliferation process which leads to an increase in\nthe numbers of cells. Hyperplasia can cause the organ size to increase. It has been suggested that the\ndevelopment of estrogen related morphogenetic\nchanges in the uterus can be considered as an early\nstep towards endometrial hyperplasia and cancer\n( 50 ). The persistent stimulation of endometrial\ntissue by estrogen (mainly estrone) in PCOS patients without the progesterone-induced inhibition\nleads to uterine hyperplasia as a preliminary step\nto carcinoma ( 1 ). Cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the human endometrial tissue take place in\na cyclic procedure as they are regulated by steroid\nhormone levels ( 20 ). In the normal endometrium,\npro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors are under\nfine regulation that leads to tissue homeostasis\nwhich can be disturbed by hormonal alterations\n( 51 , 52 ). The uterus response to estrogen requires\nchanges in the expression of genes whose products\nregulate successive and functionally interlinked\ncellular processes. Researchers suggest that the\nearliest changes after 17\u03b2-ethinyl estradiol treatment occur in the expression genes whose products are involved in transcriptional regulation and\nsignal transduction, followed by those involved in\nmRNA and protein synthesis, cell cycle regulation,\nDNA replication, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and immunological responses ( 53 ).    Conclusion  Administration of EV to induce an animal model\nof PCOS caused changes in epithelial height, uterus wall thickness, and the quantity of eosinophil\ncells. Additionally, PCOS rats showed considerably higher rates of proliferation in the glandular\nepithelium region of their uteri. Hence, it could be\nconcluded that excessive estrogen content attributed to EV administration, caused an increase in\nthe mitogenic activity of the uterus, which could\nbe a prologue to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.",
