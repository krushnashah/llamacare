    "body": "I NTRODUCTION  Consistent with the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), infertility is a disability that is defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after at least 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse.[ 1 ] Infertility afflicts approximately one in eight women all over the world.[ 2 ] One of the well-known causes of female subfertility is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Its prevalence varies between 5% and 13% of women at reproductive age worldwide.[ 3 ] Subfertility is a term that refers to any form of diminished fertility that is followed by an unwanted duration of infertility.[ 4 ] Increased ovarian androgen production is one of the most common clinical signs of PCOS. This excess androgen leads to anovulation. Genetic components play a critical role in the etiology of PCOS and contribute to more than 70% of PCOS pathogenesis.[ 5 ] The recognition of differentially expressed genes in PCOS patients might provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this syndrome and paves the way for the expansion of novel therapeutics.  Egg donation is a kind of assisted reproductive technology (ART).[ 6 ] Ovulation failure, genetic disease, inadequate reaction to ovarian stimulation, poor egg or embryo quality in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, failed IVF attempts, and old maternal age are all reasons to use oocyte donation.[ 7 ] The father's sperm is employed to fertilize the donated egg and the resultant embryo is then implanted into the mother's uterus. Thus, egg donation helps infertile women to become pregnant.[ 8 ] Oocytes were donated by women who had normal ovarian function.[ 7 ]  Cumulus cells (CCs) are a collection of somatic follicular cells around the oocyte which interact with each other and with the oocyte through gap junctions. Oocyte competence is achieved via these gap junctions, and these interactions provide the nourishment and development of oocytes.[ 9 ] Previous studies confirm that oocyte development will not occur in the absence of CCs.[ 10 11 12 ]  Several studies have revealed that gene expression profiles in CCs could be considered biological criteria to predict embryo competence. Indeed, there is a correlation between mRNA expression in CCs and oocyte and/or embryo quality.[ 9 ]  The target genes in this study were chosen because of their significant role in fertility success and embryo development.[ 13 ] Calmodulin (CaM) is a multifunctional calcium ion sensor that is involved in the calcium signaling pathway. In mammals, CaM is encoded by three nonallelic CaM (Calm) genes ( CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 ) that produce the same protein with no amino acid substitution.[ 14 ] Teves et al . showed that calcium pathway plays a vital role in human fertility.[ 15 ] Before the preovulatory LH surge, oocytes are halted at the dictyate stage of meiosis I under the influence of CCs.[ 16 ] The CCs synthesize cyclic AMP, a meiosis inhibitory factor that leads to the suspension of meiosis. The resumption of meiosis is imposed by LH surge. Ca2+ is essential for this process. Ca2+ bound with calmodulin is considered a second messenger in response to LH surge and follicle-stimulating hormone.[ 17 ]  CALM1 is located on chromosome 14q32.11.[ 18 ] CALM1 is involved in different pathways in cellular physiological processes including cell homeostasis and proliferation. It was reported that expression levels of CALM1 in the ovarian tissues of patients with PCOS increased by at least two-fold.[ 13 ] Therefore, CALM1 is a key competence marker which is highly associated with PCOS.  Since CALM1 expression level elevates in PCOS ovary in comparison to normal ovary, it is likely that CALM1 expression affects ovarian cell proliferation and differentiation in PCOS.  Previous studies have revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) manage a variety of essential processes that are involved in human oocyte formation and function. For instance, Nakagawa S et al . demonstrated that specific lncRNAs play pivotal roles in the occurrence of pregnancy.[ 19 ] Studies have also shown that some lncRNAs expressed in CCs may be associated with PCOS.[ 20 ] In 2017, Liu et al . introduced lncRNAs that were involved in the proliferation of CCs.[ 21 ]  LncRNA AK124742 is located on chromosome 3p14[ 22 ] and is transcribed in a complex locus with normal antisense patterns in contrast to the adjacent PSMD6 gene. PSMD6 expression in CCs is linked to embryo competence and pregnancy.[ 23 ]  PSMD6 (proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 6) gene can be found on chromosome 3p14.1.[ 24 ] This gene encodes a member of 26S proteasome family. The proteasomal activity of 26s proteasome plays a variety of roles in the resumption of oocyte meiosis, cumulus expansion, repositioning of the extracellular matrix, alteration of cumulus\u2013oocyte connection, and degeneration of actin microfilament. 26S proteasome is necessary for the progression of oocyte meiosis.[ 16 ]  This study aimed at investigating the relationship between PCOS and the candidate genes, which are three well-known genes associated with embryo development. These genes play a crucial role in the occurrence of a successful pregnancy. The expression of CALM1 , PSMD6 , and AK124742 genes in the CCs of infertile PCOS patients with their expression in the cumulus donor fertile group was compared.    M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS  This study examined cross-sectional associations of infertility with gene expression in a sample of 33 infertile PCOS women versus the same number of fertile cumulus donor women.  The sample size was n = 66. The patients referring Hazrat Maryam Fertility Center of Shahid Beheshti Hospital and Isfahan Fertility and Infertility Center underwent an IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. The study included women with an average age of 32.48 years. All the patients had filled out an informed consent form. The number of individual samples was 66 oocyte-cumulus complexes obtained over a period of 9 months between April 2020 and January 2021. These individual samples were presented with normal hormone values and their partner had normal sperm quality.  The participants were diagnosed as PCOS patients if they met two criteria out of the three Rotterdam Criteria: oligo-ovulation or anovulation (cycle length <26 days or >35 days), clinical hyperandrogenism (including signs such as hirsutism), and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism (including a raised free androgen index or free testosterone and polycystic ovaries visible on ultrasound).  This study included healthy fertile women as the control group and the patients who were characterized as infertile due to PCOS by the presence of the following features:   Normal spermiogram of the partner according to the WHO criteria until the time of this study The number of at least one obtained oocyte Antagonist protocol for ovarian hyperstimulation.   The patients who refused to cooperate, those with a lack of mature oocytes for retrieval after ovulation induction in ART, and the PCOS patients who were characterized as infertile by the presence of other factors were excluded from the study. The cumulus donor group was the oocyte donor patients who had no underlying disease.   Cumulus\u2013oocyte complex collection  Following ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration, follicular fluid corresponding to all patients\u2019 follicles was aspirated and accumulated separately and placed on ice at once. As mature oocytes were surrounded by CCs, cumulus\u2013oocyte complexes (COCs) were picked and placed in SynVitro flushing medium (origin company, REF: 15760125A). Both the CCs and the oocytes were thoroughly examined under Olympus Stereomicroscope. A proportion of the CCs was separated from the cumulus\u2013oocyte complexes by using two sharp needles under the loop microscope, while the remaining CCs were removed from the COCs with hyaluronidase (SAGE IVF Inc. Hyaluronidase, REF art-4007). The denuded oocytes were placed in Fert medium (ORIGIO. REF 83010010A) and the CCs were quickly transferred into a sterile tube and washed in several droplets of the free enzyme medium. The collected CCs were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 12000 g for 2 min. The supernatant was then discarded and the pellets of the CCs were then transferred to cryovials and immediately stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C.    RNA isolation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis  The total RNAs were isolated using BioFACT\u2122 Total RNA Prep Kit (BIO FACT, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng RNA using BioFACT\u2122 5X RT Pre-Mix Kit (BIO FACT, South Korea) with random hexamer primers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed using AlleleID 7.6 software (Premier Biosoft) and synthesized by Metabion (Germany) [ Table 1 ]. The real-time PCR was carried out using BioFACT\u2122 2X Real-Time PCR Master Mix Kit (BIO FACT, South Korea) and StepOnePlus\u2122 quantitative real-time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR reactions were performed at a total volume of 10 \u03bcl. The PCR amplification conditions consisted of 15 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing and extension for 1 min at 60\u00b0C. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was chosen as a housekeeping gene. The expression levels of each target gene were calculated using 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.

Released 2011. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Quantitative variables were described as means \u00b1 standard deviation; the independent sample t -test was applied. The correlation coefficient was used to examine the variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all statistical tests.     R ESULTS  The mean age of the population in this study was 32.48 \u00b1 5.37 years. According to Table 2 , the PCOS patients were generally younger with a mean age of 31.12 \u00b1 5.18 years relative to that of 33.84 \u00b1 5.28 years in the cumulus donor group ( P = 0.38). Compared to the PCOS group (25.37%), the cumulus donor group (39.7%) had a higher proportion of median Vitamin D level ( P = 0.000). Besides, prolactin (PRL) level and weight showed no significant differences between the two groups. The mean weight of the PCOS group was higher than the cumulus donor group although the difference was not significant.

The expression profiles of the three genes in each cumulus donor and the PCOS group were analyzed. The reference gene, GAPDH , with a Ct variation of <1, was chosen for normalization.  Higher levels of CALM1 and AK124742 genes were detected in the PCOS patients, and the difference was significant ( CALM1  P = 0.003) ( AK124742 P = 0.000). However, PSMD6 expression level was significantly lower in the CCs of the PCOS patients than cumulus donors ( P = 0.002) [ Figure 1 ].   Figure 1   (a) Comparison of CALM1 gene expression between cumulus donor (egg donor) and polycystic ovary syndrome groups. In the polycystic ovary syndrome group ( n = 33), CALM1 gene expression was significantly higher than the control group ( n = 33) ( P = 0.003). (b) Comparison of PSMD6 gene expression between cumulus donor group and polycystic ovary syndrome group. In the polycystic ovary syndrome group ( n = 33), PSMD6 gene expression was significantly higher than the control group ( n = 33) ( P = 0.002). (c) Comparison of AK124742 gene expression between cumulus donor group and polycystic ovary syndrome group. In the polycystic ovary syndrome group ( n = 33), AK124742 gene expression was significantly higher than the control group ( n = 33) ( P = 0.000)       Correlation in gene expression pattern  Statistical analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between PSMD6 and AK124742 gene expressions both in the cumulus donor group ( r 2 = 0.405, P = 0.021) and the PCOS group ( r 2 = 0.475, P = 0.009). Moreover, they showed a significant positive correlation between PSMD6 and CALM1 gene expressions in the PCOS group ( r 2 = 0.543, P = 0.002).     D ISCUSSION  Recognizing differentially expressed genes in PCOS patients might provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology and paves the way for the expansion of novel therapeutics. Several studies have shown that oocyte development is reflected in CC genes expression and profiling gene expression in CCs is associated with oocyte maturation status.  The women who were diagnosed with PCOS were significantly younger than non-PCOS women [ Figure 2 ]. Due to growing obesity and insulin resistance in adolescent girls, the diagnosis of PCOS is increasing in this age group.[ 25 ] Moreover, early diagnosis and proper treatment of PCOS would prevent complications and preserve fertility in patients with PCOS.[ 26 ] Therefore, it is assumed that the PCOS group decided to have children at a younger age due to the earlier diagnosis of their disease and the awareness of the helpful effect of early treatment through recommendations and information given by their physicians.   Figure 2   (a) Vitamin D levels in the cumulus donor (egg donor) group and polycystic ovary syndrome group ( P = 0.000). (b) Prolactin level in the cumulus donor (egg donor) group and polycystic ovary syndrome group ( P = 0.774). (c) Age comparison in control and polycystic ovary syndrome groups ( P = 0.38). (d) Comparison of weight in the cumulus donor (egg donor) group and polycystic ovary syndrome group ( P = 0.821) (mean \u00b1 standard deviation)     In 2012, in a review study of 106 separate studies, Lim et al . reported that women with PCOS were further likely to be overweight and there was a positive correlation between obesity and PCOS over years.[ 27 ] Teede et al . in 2013 and Lim et al . in 2019 confirmed these results and reported that women with PCOS were at higher risk of weight gain.[ 28 ] In this study, the mean weight of the PCOS group was higher than the cumulus donor group although the difference was not significant [ Table 1 ]. The insignificance of this difference was due to the younger age of the PCOS group; therefore, it is assumed that this difference would become significant over a longer period of time as the cumulus donor group gets older or if both the groups of our study were in the same age.  Considering Vitamin D level \u226430 ng/mL as the level of insufficiency (insufficiency \u226430), a deficiency of Vitamin D was observed in the PCOS group with an average level of 25.37 [ Figure 2 ]. Vitamin D deficiency is almost prevalent among PCOS women.[ 29 30 ] What was more appealing was a Report by Mahmoudi in 2009. They believed that Vitamin D affected the development of PCOS by gene transcription.[ 31 ]  It was concluded that there was no significant difference between the PCOS and non-PCOS groups at PRL level, however, PRL Level was slightly lower in the PCOS group [ Figure 2 ]. In 2015, Szosland et al . reported the same result.[ 32 ] In 2020, Yang et al . reported this difference as meaningful in a long-term study that included 2052 patients with PCOS.[ 33 ]  Several studies suggest that oocyte development is associated with CC gene expression.[ 34 ] Previous studies adopting QPCR method demonstrated that some genes such as PSMD6 , CALM1 , and NRP1 may show the developmental capability of embryos.[ 35 36 37 ] In 2015, Li et al . explained that the increased expression levels of AK124742 and PSMD6 in oocytes led to successful pregnancy.[ 23 ]  Genetic components play a critical role in the etiology of PCOS. Genetics contributes to more than 70% of PCOS pathogenesis (Crespo, 2018). Zhang et al . found 160 genes that were differentially expressed in CCs of PCOS and normal patients.[ 22 ]  The analysis of our data showed that CALM1 gene expression significantly increased in the PCOS group compared to the cumulus donor group. Previous studies showed that CALM1 expression increased in the CCs of PCOS patients compared to normal patients.[ 38 ] Furthermore, in a study focusing on determining the role of heat shock protein 90B1 in patients with PCOS, it was reported that expression levels of signaling activator calmodulin 1 ( CALM1 ) in the ovarian tissues of the patients with PCOS increased by at least two-fold.[ 13 ]  Although lncRNA does not encrypt any protein, it is involved in various biological functions. A number of novel lncRNA molecules are playing important roles in the maturation of the oocyte. The functional role of most lncRNAs is not yet known in CCs. Moreover, new evidence reveals that the increase in PSMD6 gene expression is associated with embryo competence and pregnancy.[ 23 ]  Comparing the expression level of PSMD6 in the PCOS group with the cumulus donor group shows a significant decrease in this gene expression in the PCOS group. The analysis of our data also showed a significant increase in AK124742 gene expression in the PCOS group in comparison to the cumulus donor group.  Previous studies also reported a positive correlation between the expression levels of AK124742 and PSMD6 .[ 39 ] The analysis of our data showed a significant positive correlation between PSMD6 gene expression and AK124742 gene expression in the cumulus donor group and in the PCOS group [ Table 3 ].[ 23 ] Consequently, it was assumed that lncRNA AK124742 and mRNA PSMD6 could form a new useful lncRNA-mRNA gene pair.[ 23 ]   Table 3   Correlation between gene expressions in both cumulus donor and polycystic ovary syndrome groups       PCOS group  Cumulus donor group             AK124742    PSMD6    CALM1    AK124742    PSMD6    CALM1        CALM1   NS  P =0.002  NS  NS  NS  NS    \u22120.002  +0.543  1  +0.208  +0.317  1     PSMD6   P =0.009  NS  P =0.002  P =0.021  NS  NS    +0.475  1  +0.543  +0.405  1  +0.317     AK124742   NS  P =0.009  NS  NS  P =0.021  NS     1  +0.475  \u22120.002  1  +0.405  +0.208       PCOS: Polycystic ovary syndrome, NS: Not significant     On the other hand, PCOS had a noticeable effect on increasing CALM1 and AK124742 gene expressions and it was accompanied by a decrease in the expression level of PSMD6 .    C ONCLUSION  In this study, the changes in the expression of three genes ( CALM , PSMD , and AK124742 long noncoding RNA) which are known as the genes affecting fertility process were investigated in patients with PCOS. These genes were applied as the criteria for selecting qualified oocytes in assisted reproductive methods. By studying the changes in the expression of the genes in polycystic groups, it was found that the expression level of the genes utilized for predicting fertility is not only influenced by fertility results but also by factors such as ovary's health condition. The relationship between the genes and PCOS was studied in particular.  It was assumed that there is a strong correlation between the genes affecting reproductive process and PCOS. It was revealed that PCOS had a noticeable effect on increasing CALM1 and AK124742 gene expressions accompanied by a decrease in the expression level of PSMD6 .  Therefore, it should be mentioned that in assessing oocyte's qualification by genetic criteria, it is not merely enough to pay attention to the role of the genes affecting fertility process. On the contrary, the ovary's health condition should be taken into consideration as a factor influencing the genes\u2019 level of expression since it leads to changes in patients\u2019 demographic and clinical features. Therefore, it seems that for selecting qualified oocytes, it is required to carry out a multidimensional investigation of various factors related to an individual's general health condition, ovary's health condition, and reproductive system's diseases such as polycystic syndrome.
