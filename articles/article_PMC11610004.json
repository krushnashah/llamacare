    "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disruption has been associated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as the evening chronotype (EC) shares several traits with PCOS, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that the biological clock could be targeted with new, preventive, and therapeutic strategies for PCOS in women with biorhythm disorders. We evaluated inner circadian rhythmicity in middle\u2010aged women with PCOS in a population\u2010based setting, focusing on whether women with PCOS and an EC have a specific subtype in relation to their clinical characteristics. The data derived from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort, a population\u2010based longitudinal birth cohort of 12\u2009058 individuals born in 1966. We compared the circadian phenotype between 314 women with PCOS (according to the Rotterdam criteria) and 1248 women without PCOS at age 46\u2009years using the validated Finnish shortened 6\u2010item Morningness\u2010Eveningness Questionnaire (sMEQ) and the single\u2010item self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness question. PCOS was not associated with the EC by the sMEQ ( The EC was not over\u2010represented in middle\u2010aged women with PCOS or in the hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes A\u2013C in our study. This does not support the need for chronotyping in the comprehensive assessment of women with PCOS. However, as chronotypes tend to change with aging, cross\u2010sectional studies in different age groups are warranted to draw conclusions on the role of chronotypes in PCOS and the associated metabolic risks. In this population\u2010based study, the evening chronotype was not over\u2010represented in middle\u2010aged women with PCOS. However, as research in the field is limited and the results are conflicting, further studies are warranted, especially since comorbidity and the risk profile connected with both PCOS and evening chronotype are similar. The present study does not support adding chronotyping to the routine evaluation of women with PCOS.",

The hyperandrogenic (A\u2013C) and non\u2010hyperandrogenic (D) phenotypes showed similar chronotype distributions.    1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disorder in women, affecting one woman out of eight worldwide. The diagnostics rely on the Rotterdam criteria, endorsed by the international PCOS guideline.  1  Typical symptoms include oligo\u2010amenorrhea (OA), hirsutism, and anovulation, but the clinical phenotype varies significantly. Four different phenotypes have been identified: type A includes hyperandrogenism+ OA\u2009+\u2009polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), type B hyperandrogenism + OA, type C hyperandrogenism + PCOM and type D OA\u2009+\u2009PCOM.  2  PCOS, and especially hyperandrogenic phenotypes A\u2013C, are associated with significant metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and susceptibility to metabolic syndrome.  3  ,  4  Therefore, PCOS is not only a gynecological disorder but a wider health issue that seems to prevail beyond menopause.  4  ,  5  ,  6    The circadian rhythm is a natural internal process that regulates the sleep\u2013wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24\u2009h. It is driven by an endogenous circadian clock that is entrained by the light\u2013dark cycle but also controlled by social habits. The chronotype determines an individual's circadian preference for behavioral and biological rhythms and is known to change with age.  7  ,  8  Three chronobiological phenotypes are recognized: the morning chronotype (MC), the intermediate chronotype (IC), and the evening chronotype (EC). The prevalence of an EC is the highest in young adulthood and decreases with age.  7  ,  8  Individuals with an EC have later sleep\u2013wake schedules, later diurnal peaks of alertness and performance, and later sleep propensity rhythms than individuals with an MC.  9  Moreover, individuals with an EC have been linked to a higher risk of social jet lag and circadian rhythm misalignment caused by late sleep onset combined with early waking and accumulation of substantial sleep deprivation during the work week.  10  Mounting evidence suggests that eveningness and circadian clock disruption increase susceptibility to endocrine and metabolic disorders associated with obesity and diabetes.  11  ,  12    Previous studies have inferred that circadian genes and altered gene expression caused by circadian misalignment might be involved in the development of PCOS.  13  ,  14  ,  15  It has even been suggested that the biological clock could be a target for new, feasible preventive and therapeutic strategies for PCOS in women with biorhythm disorders.  13  To our knowledge, however, only one case\u2013control study has investigated circadian rhythmicity in women with PCOS.  16  In that study, PCOS was associated with the EC, and the women of fertile age with PCOS and an EC were more likely to be obese, hyperandrogenic, and insulin\u2010resistant, with unhealthier eating and lifestyle habits, than the women with PCOS and an MC or IC. This result underlined the relevance of including chronotype assessment in the evaluation and treatment of women with PCOS.  16  To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated circadian rhythmicity in different PCOS phenotypes or in middle\u2010aged PCOS population.  The main aim of our study was to evaluate the inner circadian rhythmicity of women with PCOS in a population\u2010based setting. As PCOS and the EC are both associated with metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric disorders,  17  ,  18  ,  19  ,  20  ,  21  we were especially interested in whether the EC is over\u2010represented also among middle\u2010aged women with PCOS and whether the different PCOS phenotypes differ as for their chronotypes. We hypothesized that in contrast to the general population in which the EC is known to decrease with age after reaching young adulthood, women with PCOS would still be more likely to represent the EC at the age of 46\u2009years, and this would be seen especially in the hyperandrogenic phenotypes A\u2010C.    2  MATERIAL AND METHODS   2.1  Study population  Our study was a substudy of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort study, a large population\u2010based longitudinal birth cohort consisting of 12\u2009058 individuals (5889 women and 6169 men) born in 1966 in the two northernmost provinces of Finland. More detailed descriptions of the study population and the formation of the PCOS and reference groups have been published earlier.  21  ,  22  In our study, the data collected at the age of 31\u2009years were used to identify women with PCOS, and the data collected at the age of 46\u2009years were used to determine the chronotype.  The definition of PCOS used in our study followed the 2023 international evidence\u2010based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS.  1  Thus, women with PCOS were identified at age 31 as having met at least two of the following criteria: OA, hirsutism/biochemical hyperandrogenism, or an anti\u2010m\u00fcllerian hormone level\u2009\u22653.2\u2009ng/mL (surrogate for PCOM); the formation of the study population has been previously reported in detail.  23  Moreover, the women with PCOS were classified into phenotypes A\u2013D. Information regarding hyperandrogenism, OA and anti\u2010m\u00fcllerian hormone was required to determine phenotype for women with PCOS.  The women without PCOS (i.e., the reference group) were selected from the cohort at the age of 31. A regular menstrual cycle, absence of hirsutism, and normal testosterone and free androgen index (FAI) as well as anti\u2010m\u00fcllerian hormone levels <3.2\u2009ng/mL were required. At the age of 31\u2009years, pregnant women ( n =\u2009277), those using hormonal contraception ( n =\u2009858), and, later, those not permitting the use of their data ( n =\u200954) or women without PCOS self\u2010reporting PCOS diagnosis at the age of 46\u2009years ( n =\u200920) were excluded. In addition, filling in at least one of the chronotype\u2010related questions at the age of 46\u2009years was required. With these criteria, altogether, 1562 women were included in the study, of which 314 women were defined as women with PCOS and 1248 women as women without PCOS (Figure 1 ). The PCOS phenotype could be determined for all women with PCOS.   FIGURE 1   Flowchart: Formation of PCOS and non\u2010PCOS groups. AMH, anti\u2010m\u00fcllerian hormone; FAI, free androgen index; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome.       2.2  Chronotype and sleep variable analysis  For the chronotyping, we used both the Finnish version of the shortened Morningness\u2010Eveningness Questionnaire (sMEQ)  24  ,  25  and the single\u2010item self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness question. The sMEQ includes six questions (items 4, 7, 9, 15, 17, and 19) drawn from the original 19\u2010item MEQ  26  version: 1) easiness getting up in the morning, 2) tiredness during the first half hour in the morning, 3) anticipated quality of performance working out in the morning, 4) preferred time for 2\u2009h of hard manual labor, 5) preferred consecutive 5\u2009h work hours and 6) self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness (Appendix S1 ). The scoring of the sMEQ acts as a continuous descriptive variable but is also used to classify the participants into the three different groups of circadian rhythmicity. These three classes were used in the analyses: MC (19\u201327 points), IC (13\u201318 points), and EC (5\u201312 points). The self\u2010reported bedtimes and waketimes were used to validate the sMEQ chronotype distribution on a three\u2010point scale: <10\u2009pm\u2009early bedtime, 10\u201312\u2009pm average bedtime, >12\u2009pm late bedtime and\u2009<6\u2009am early waketime, 6\u20138\u2009am average waketime, >8\u2009am late waketime. The calculated Cronbach's alpha for the reliability of the sMEQ in the study population was 0.76 indicating a good internal consistency.  Self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness was used as the single\u2010item test for the chronotype. Similar to the sMEQ, the single\u2010item morningness\u2010eveningness was transformed into a three\u2010category variable in response to the sMEQ chronotyping: MC (definitely a \u201cmorning\u201d person), IC (more a \u201cmorning\u201d than an \u201cevening\u201d person or more an \u201cevening\u201d than a \u201cmorning\u201d person), and EC (definitely an \u201cevening\u201d person).    2.3  Basic characteristics  The basic characteristics collected included body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ), smoking (yes/no), alcohol consumption (no use, light use <150\u2009g/week, moderate use 150\u2013210\u2009g/week or heavy use >210\u2009g/week), physical activity (low\u2009=\u2009no strenuous sports, moderate\u2009=\u2009everyday functional exercise \u22654\u2009h/week, or high\u2009=\u2009fitness sports \u22652\u2009h/week or competitive training several times a week), family status (other people living in the household or living alone) and educational level (low\u2009=\u2009basic education, middle\u2009=\u2009secondary education, or high\u2009=\u2009higher education degree). The women were classified as regular daytime workers (work hours between 6\u2009am\u20136\u2009pm) and shift workers. The shift workers had any other working hours than regular daytime workers, and shiftwork included evening, two\u2010shift, and nighttime shift work.  The state of climacteric transition was assessed based on the menstrual cycle and climacteric vasomotor symptoms.  27  Women reported their climacteric vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and/or night sweats) on a 5\u2010point scale, which was dichotomized in the statistical analysis as yes (=some, quite a lot, or very much) or no (=not at all or hardly any). They were also asked whether they currently had a regular, irregular or no menstrual cycle. The depressive and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Hopkins symptom checklist\u201025,  28  in which cutoff points of \u22651.55 for milder and\u2009\u22651.75 for more serious and clinically relevant depressive and anxiety symptoms have previously been used.  28  Current medication was assessed, including use of sleep medications: drugs the women self\u2010reported using as sleep medications and those nationally recommended for the use of insomnia were selected (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification codes: N05AA02, N05AA03, N05AF03, N05AH04, N05BA01, N05BA04, N05BB01, N05CD07, N05CF01, N05CF02, N05CH01, N06AA06, N06AA09, N06AA12, N06AX05, and N06AX11).  29  The FAI was calculated using the equation\u00a0100\u2009\u00d7\u2009testosterone (nmol/liter)/sex hormone binding globulin, (nmol/liter). From the basic characteristics, the testosterone and FAI were clinically measured at the age of 31 and BMI at the age of 46\u2009years. All other variables were self\u2010reported in the questionnaire completed at 46\u2009years of age.    2.4  Statistical analyses  The normality of the continuous variables was assessed visually. Differences in characteristics among the study groups were analyzed with the Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, or Chi\u2010square test, as appropriate. The data are shown as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles or as counts and percentages. To investigate associations between the study groups and chronotype classifications, a multinomial logistic regression was used for an sMEQ\u2010based three\u2010class chronotype (MC/IC/EC). For a two\u2010class self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness, a logistic regression model was applied. The sMEQ\u2010score was also analyzed as a continuous variable with a linear regression model. Additionally, associations with preferred consecutive 5\u2009h work hours were examined with a Poisson regression model. Univariate models, as well as multivariate models with adjustments for BMI (continuous), education, shiftwork status, and climacteric vasomotor symptoms (categorical), separately and combined, were fitted. The selection of the confounders was based on the literature  30  ,  31  and statistical information. For the logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, the results are presented as odds ratios (ORs), for the Poisson regression as incidence rate ratios, and for the linear regression as regression coefficient betas, all with 95% confidence intervals and p\u2010 values. The linear multivariate regression models were checked for meeting the assumptions: the residuals were normally distributed and showed no patterns of heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation. With all adjusting variables added, variance inflation factor values ranged between 1.012 and 1.044, confirming the absence of multicollinearity. Spearman correlations between adjusting variables varied from \u22120.203 to 0.100. For the logistic regression models, the Hosmer\u2010Lemeshow test p\u2010 values were non\u2010significant, indicating that the models provided a good fit. Also, for multinomial logistic regression models, non\u2010significant p \u2010values from Pearson and Deviance goodness\u2010of\u2010fit tests confirmed that the models fit the data well. Likewise, for Poisson regression models, the non\u2010significant Chi\u2010square test p\u2010 values confirmed a good model fit.  The statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 29 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A p\u2010 value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Basic characteristics of women with PCOS and women without PCOS  Compared to the women without PCOS, the women with PCOS had a higher average BMI ( p =\u20090.001). However, the majority (PCOS 72.4% and non\u2010PCOS 78.8%) of the women in both groups had a BMI\u2009<\u200930\u2009kg/m 2 . Fewer women with PCOS reported having currently climacteric vasomotor symptoms ( p =\u20090.034) or an irregular or no menstrual cycle ( p =\u20090.003), and fewer of them lived alone ( p =\u20090.022). A greater proportion of women with PCOS had lower levels of education ( p =\u20090.039). The women with PCOS had higher testosterone ( p <\u20090.001) and FAI ( p <\u20090.001) levels at the age of 31\u2009years, as expected. No differences were found in smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, number of shift workers, depressive and anxiety symptoms, or use of sleep medication between the groups (Table 1 ).

When the basic characteristics in the three different sMEQ groups were compared separately among the women with PCOS and the women without PCOS, several differences were found between the women without PCOS as for their chronotype groups. A larger proportion of women without PCOS and an EC were smokers ( p =\u20090.038), had more extensive alcohol consumption ( p =\u20090.031), were physically less active ( p <\u20090.001), were shift workers ( p =\u20090.014), had more depressive and anxiety symptoms ( p <\u20090.001), and used sleep medication more often ( p <\u20090.001) compared with the women without PCOS and with an MC or IC. Furthermore, the women without PCOS and an EC had lower FAI levels ( p =\u20090.021) at the age of 31\u2009years than the women without PCOS and with an MC or IC, but the testosterone levels did not differ.  Fewer differences were found between the sMEQ groups in the women with PCOS than between the sMEQ groups in the women without PCOS. However, more women with PCOS and an EC had depressive and anxiety symptoms ( p =\u20090.012) and were more likely to use sleep medication ( p =\u20090.017) than the women with PCOS and an MC or IC (Table 2 ). Only one woman with PCOS, who participated in the survey at the age of 46, was excluded from the study due to lack of sleep data. No differences in the basic characteristics compared to the other women with PCOS were found.   TABLE 2   Basic characteristics of women with PCOS and women without PCOS by sMEQ.

The mean sMEQ score in the women with PCOS was 17.1 (standard deviation 4.4), and in the women without PCOS, it was 17.5 (standard deviation 4.2) ( p =\u20090.199). The most frequent chronotypes by the sMEQ were IC (PCOS 47.7% and non\u2010PCOS 45.2%) and MC (PCOS 38.4% and non\u2010PCOS 42.0%). Of the women with and without PCOS, 13.9% and 12.7%, respectively, had an EC. No differences were found in the risk for EC (OR 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.81\u20131.77) or IC (OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.88\u20131.51) in the women with PCOS compared to the women without PCOS. The results remained after adjustment for BMI, education, shiftwork, and climacteric vasomotor symptoms. (Tables 3 and 4 ).

The values of self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness differed from the sMEQ chronotype distribution ( p <\u20090.001). Most of the women who perceived themselves as \u201cdefinitely morning types\u201d were also classified with an MC according to the sMEQ (97.2%). Of the self\u2010assessed women with an IC, 34.0% were classified as having an MC, and 30.7% of the women with a self\u2010assessed EC were classified as having an IC when chronotyped by the sMEQ. Both the women with PCOS and the women without PCOS were more likely to self\u2010assess themselves as having an IC (PCOS 66.5% and non\u2010PCOS 68.4%) than an MC (PCOS 17.6% and non\u2010PCOS 18.9%) or EC (PCOS 16.0% and non\u2010PCOS 12.6%). When comparing the self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness between the women with PCOS and the women without PCOS, no difference was found (OR 1.36, 95% confidence interval 0.88\u20132.10 for EC/MC and OR 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.75\u20131.46 IC/MC, p =\u20090.303). After adjustments, the results remained (Tables 3 and 4 ).  The self\u2010reported bedtimes and waketimes of the different sMEQ chronotype groups corresponded to the sMEQ chronotype distribution. The women with an EC were more likely to have a late bedtime on working days (EC 9.7%, IC 1.6%, MC 0.3%, p <\u20090.001), but especially on leisure days (EC 38.3%, IC 11.0%, MC 4.6%, p <\u20090.001) compared with the women with an IC or MC. The women with an EC were also more likely to have a late waketime on working days (EC 14.3%, IC 3.6%, IC 1.7%, p <\u20090.001) and especially on leisure days (EC 87.3%, IC 65.3%, MC 26.9%, p <\u20090.001), respectively.    3.3  PCOS phenotypes and chronotype distribution  Most of the PCOS women represented phenotypes D or C (35.7%, n =\u2009112 and 33.4% n =\u2009105, respectively), whereas only 17.8% ( n =\u200956) of the women were classified as phenotype A and 13.1% ( n =\u200941) as phenotype B. The mean sMEQ score in the hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes A\u2013C was 16.9 (standard deviation 4.4), and in phenotype D it was 17.6 (standard deviation 4.5) ( p =\u20090.433). When comparing sMEQ and the self\u2010assessed chronotype distribution between the PCOS phenotypes A\u2013C and phenotype D, no differences between the groups were found (sMEQ p =\u20090.452 and self\u2010assessed p =\u20090.071) (Table S1 ).     4  DISCUSSION  The aim of our study was to investigate the association between PCOS and diurnal chronotypes. Contrary to our hypothesis, PCOS was not associated with an EC in middle\u2010aged women. Further, the chronotypes of hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes A\u2013C did not differ from those of PCOS phenotype D. Most of the women with PCOS and the women without PCOS were classified as IC both by the sMEQ and by self\u2010assessment. An EC was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and the use of sleep medication both in the women with PCOS and the women without PCOS.  To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study  16  by an Italian study group has surveyed the possible association between diurnal preference and PCOS in a case\u2013control study setting, but with no phenotype analysis. They showed that women of fertile age with PCOS had a higher prevalence of an EC, which was additionally associated with a worse hormonal and metabolic profile. Our study was not able to confirm this finding in our middle\u2010aged population. In addition to the population\u2010based differences, the differences may be explained by the different study designs. Although both were case\u2013control studies, there were differences in the selection strategy and population characteristics. The population\u2010based setting of our study made it likely that women with milder menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenic symptoms were included in our PCOS population, however, thus reflecting the real\u2010life range of PCOS phenotypes. The PCOS group in Barrea et\u00a0al.'s study was selected from an endocrinology unit. A difference in patient characteristics has been shown in a previous systematic review and meta\u2010analysis comparing referral vs unselected population studies.  32  Compared to our women with PCOS, the women with PCOS in Barrea et\u00a0al.'s study were more likely to be obese, suggesting a possible dominance of the PCOS phenotype A. As for participant age, the women in our study were older and of similar age, whereas Barrea et\u00a0al.ss study included women of fertile age with an age range of over 20\u2009years. This is important, as there is a correlation between age and chronotype, with a decreasing probability of eveningness after reaching young adulthood and when women are approaching menopause.  7  ,  8  ,  30  Thus, taking the results of these studies together, one can hypothesize that the connection between PCOS and EC might be more related to younger women with PCOS, underlining the role of more hyperandrogenic phenotypes at a young age. Further, we used the shortened sMEQ alongside the self\u2010assessed morningness\u2010eveningness and not the original 19\u2010item MEQ that Barrea et\u00a0al. used. However, the original MEQ and various shortened versions of the MEQ are widely used, as are validated scales to measure chronotypes, especially in epidemiological studies.  33  ,  34  ,  35  ,  36    Determining diurnal preference is a continuum that needs to be considered when evaluating different study results.  37  In our study, there was a difference between the number of women with an MC, IC, and EC based on the method used, as self\u2010assessment showed a lower number of women with an MC than the sMEQ. Nevertheless, the chronotype distribution between the middle\u2010aged women with and without PCOS was consistent with most of the women classified as IC, regardless of the method used. The distribution of chronotypes in our population correlated well with previously conducted chronotype studies in the Finnish general population at the age of 46,  8  ,  25  as well as with the previous chronotype studies of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966.  38  ,  39  As Merikanto et\u00a0al. showed,  37  the self\u2010assessed single\u2010item chronotyping method seems to result in a higher prevalence of evening preference compared with chronotyping by the sMEQ, suggesting that the distribution by sMEQ supported by the bedtimes and waketimes, could be considered closer to the true intrinsic chronotype of our study population.  The major strength of our study is its population\u2010based study design. In addition, the response rates and the sample size were good, allowing us to evaluate a real spectrum of PCOS manifestations. Furthermore, we used the validated shortened 6\u2010item Finnish version of the MEQ supported by the bedtimes and waketimes to determine the different chronotypes. Moreover, the strictly defined age of the study participants eliminated bias caused by age variations in the study population. As stated, the effect of age, approaching menopause, and sex on chronotype is well acknowledged,  7  ,  8  ,  30  and the impact of menopausal transition was taken into account in statistical adjustments. We also used anti\u2010m\u00fcllerian hormone as a PCOM marker in accordance with the latest PCOS guideline,  1  and thus, we were able to use the Rotterdam criteria to define women with PCOS, although individual ultrasound examinations were not available.  The study's limitations include missing data, as not all women who participated in the survey and clinical examination at the age of 31, participated in the survey at the age of 46 or answered the questions regarding chronotype. In addition, the women using contraceptive methods or being pregnant at the age of 31\u2009years were excluded from the study to minimize the hormonal bias caused by these factors. This may have excluded some women with PCOS using contraception because of more severe PCOS symptoms. The chronotype was self\u2010reported and no objective sleep measurements, such as actigraphy or polysomnography, were carried out. However, the 6\u2010item sMEQ used has previously been shown to explain 83% of the variance in the full 19\u2010item MEQ scale, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.76\u20130.8, indicating an acceptable or good internal consistency.  24  ,  25  ,  37  The calculated Cronbach's alpha for our study population was 0.76 and we used self\u2010reported sleep timing to confirm the sMEQ chronotype distribution. The sleep questions were answered at the age of 46\u2009years, most likely entailing fewer PCOS symptoms at that age, when other women also start experiencing an increasing metabolic burden and climacteric symptoms that can affect the sleep patterns and circadian rhythms.  30  ,  31  This and the generally smaller prevalence of an EC at the age of 46\u2009years than in young adulthood  7  ,  8  should be considered as possible factors overshadowing the plausible differences between women with and without PCOS, as well as PCOS phenotypes. On the other hand, as multimorbidity associated with PCOS and an EC has been shown to persist until later in life  5  ,  6  ,  20  ,  39  ,  40  and the general life expectancy of women is over 80\u2009years in many countries, analyses at older ages and when the women are approaching menopause are especially warranted.    5  CONCLUSION  In this population\u2010based study, the EC was not over\u2010represented in middle\u2010aged women with PCOS. However, as research in the field is limited and the results are conflicting, further studies are warranted, especially since comorbidity and the risk profile connected with both PCOS and EC are similar. The present study does not support adding chronotyping to the routine evaluation of women with PCOS.
