    "abstract": "Aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effects of trans-anethole, against polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome (PCOS) induced histopathological and biochemical changes in female Wister rats. In this experimental study, forty-eight animals were randomly assigned into 6 groups: con-\ntrol; PCOS; PCOS+trans-anethole (20, 40, 80 mg/kg); and PCOS+metformin (300 mg/kg). Testosterone (1 mg/kg/\nday) was injected intraperitoneally for 35 days to induce PCOS. After PCOS induction, animals were treated by trans-\nanethole and metformin (30 days oral gavage). Finally, serum oxidative stress and insulin levels as well as histological\nchanges in ovaries, kidneys and liver were evaluated. In PCOS group, the serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was 1.391 \u00b1 0.18 mmol/L and significantly\nincreased (P=0.000) compared to the control group with the MDA level of 0.35 \u00b1 0.08. Meanwhile the activity of\nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and total thiol levels were significantly decreased (P=0.000 for all\ngroups), compared to the control group. In the trans-anethole (80 mg/kg) treated group, insulin (P=0.000) and MDA\n(P=0.000) levels were significantly decreased while total thiol (P=0.001) and activity of SOD (P=0.000) and CAT\n(P=0.007) were significantly increased compared to the PCOS group. In the metformin treated group the insulin level\n(P=0.03) decreased compared to the PCOS group. Histological evaluation showed multiple cysts in the ovarian tissue,\nan increase in inflammatory cells in the liver, and a loss of order in the structure of the tubules and glomeruli of the\nkidney in the PCOS group. Tissue damage was reduced in the trans-anethole treated group. Tarns-anethole at a dose of 80 mg/kg improved metabolic status, oxidative stress, liver and kidney dam-\nage as well as the cystic mass of ovarian tissue. To understand the exact protective effects of trans-anethole in PCOS,\nmore experimental or clinical studies are suggested.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered as\nan endocrine-metabolic disease, which highly increases\nthe risk of infertility and metabolic disorders including\nobesity, insulin resistance, and type2 diabetes ( 1 ).\nHyperandrogenism signs or symptoms such as alopecia,\nacne, and hirsutism are common in most women with\nPCOS. A major feature of PCOS is the increase of androgen\nproduction and insulin levels that result in suppressing\nthe production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)\nand its release from the liver. As a result, the level of\nfree testosterone would increase in the PCOS patients\n( 2 ). Moreover, PCOS is associated with elevation of free radicals and decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes\nand serum levels of antioxidants. However, the role of\noxidative stress markers in the pathogenesis of PCOS\nneeds to be completely determined. It was suggested that\noxidative stress might alter ovarian steroid synthesis, which\nleads to increased androgen levels, disturbance of follicular\ndevelopment, and infertility in PCOS patients ( 3 ).  Induction of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in PCOS have also been identified as\nfactors in promoting oxidative stress ( 4 ). Insulin resistance might result in ovarian cysts\nby increasing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 production ( 5 ). Lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) formation have been shown to cause oxidative stress damage due to the\nconversion of the glutathione reduced form (GSH) to the Glutathione disulfide (GSSG)\noxidized form ( 6 ). Factors contributing to oxidative stress, including chronic inflammation\nand infection, obesity, and insulin resistance have been shown to be related to an excess of\noxidative stress markers in women with PCOS ( 2 ). Different types of anti-PCOS drugs are\nprescribed for reducing these complications, but these drugs have no definitive therapeutic\neffects, and in most PCOS patients these drugs have undesirable side effects ( 7 ). Nowadays,\nthe tendency to use herbal medicines and natural products for the treatment of disease has\nbeen increased. Foeniculum Vulgare ( F. Vulgare ) is a\nfunctional food plant widely used to treat hormonal disorders and regulation of menstrual\ncycles for its estrogenic properties ( 8 ). F. Vulgare contains protein,\ncalcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, vitamins A and C, and has antimicrobial and\nantioxidant properties ( 9 ). Trans-anethole is one of the most important active ingredients\nof F. Vulgare , with many pharmacological properties ( 10 ).  Trans-anethole has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and\nestrogenic properties ( 11 ). In a previous study, 35 days\ntestosterone injection in rats increased the serum levels\nof testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and lipids which\nare markers of PCOS induction ( 12 ). However, to the best\nof our knowledge the effects of trans-anethole against\nmetabolic and histological changes of PCOS induced by\ntestosterone had not been evaluated. Moreover, metformin\nis one of the most common medications prescribed to\nPCOS patients which can modulate oxidative stress and\ndecreases serum androgen levels in PCOS patients ( 13 ).\nTherefore, in the present study, our aim was to examine the\neffects of trans-anethole and metformin on the histological\nchanges in the ovaries, liver and kidneys as well as serum\nbiochemical markers of testosterone-induced PCOS rats.    Materials and Methods  Drugs and materials were obtained as follows:\nTestosterone enanthate (IM) (Caspian, Iran), transanethole (Sigma, China), metformin (Sigma, India), and\nolive oil (Farabi, Iran). Enzyme immunoassay kits were\nused for measurement of insulin (Cayman Chemical,\nUSA) by ELIZA ( 14 ) and materials for measurement\nof oxidative stress marker were obtained from Merck\n(Germany). All chemicals and reagents for histological\nassessments were purchased from Farzan Azma (Iran).   Animals  In this experimental study, forty-eight female Wister rats\n(8 weeks, 180-210 g) were obtained from the animal care\nfacility of the Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University\nof Medical Sciences, Iran. During the experiment, animals\nwere kept under standard conditions (22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 12\nhour light-dark cycles) with free access to water and food.\nThe study protocol was performed in accordance with\nethical policies and principles approved by the Committee\non Animal Research of Mashhad University of Medical\nSciences (IR.MUMS.MEDICAL.REC.1399.075).    Experimental design  Animals were randomly divided into six groups (n=8)\nas: control; PCOS non-treated; PCOS treated group\nwith metformin (300 mg/kg) which is represented\nas metformin; PCOS treated groups with 3 doses of\ntrans-anethole (20,40, 80 mg/kg) (12, 15); which are\nrepresented as trans20, trans40 and trans80. To induce the\nPCOS model, dissolved testosterone in olive oil (1 mg/\nkg/day) was intraperitoneally injected for 35 days ( 12 ).\nAfter PCOS induction, treatments were given orally by\ngavage for the next 30 days. At the end of the study, for\nmeasurement of serum biochemical and oxidative stress\nparameters, rats were fasted overnight and blood samples\nwere collected, serum was isolated and kept at -20\u00b0C. The\nserum levels of insulin, MDA, total thiol content, and\nactivities of CAT, and SOD were assayed. In addition,\nfor histological examination, the liver, ovary, and kidney\ntissues were dissected and isolated.    Measurement of superoxide dismutase activity  SOD activity was measured by the Madesh and\nBalasurbamanian colorimetric methods, using 96-\nwell microtiter plates ( 16 ). Briefly, the appropriate\namount of serum, MTT [3-( 4 , 5 -dimethylthiazol-2-yl)\n2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and pyrogallol were\npoured into the wells and incubated for 5 minutes at room\ntemperature and in a dark environment. After adding the\ndimethyl sulfoxide inhibitor, its absorption was read at\n570 nm, and the results were reported in u/ml.    Measurement of catalase activity  The CAT activity was assayed according to the Abei\ncolorimetric method. The decomposition of hydrogen\nperoxide (30 mM) micromoles per milligram of protein\nsample was considered as one unit of CAT activity. The\nreduction was measured using a spectrophotometer at 240\nnm ( 17 ).    Measurement of malondialdehyde  MDA Measurement was performed to determine serum\nlipid peroxidation. The method was done as previously\ndescribed ( 18 ).    Measurement of total thiol content  Total thiol content (mM) was assayed using the method\nof Ellman ( 19 ).    Histology  For histology, after removing the organs, (kidneys,\novaries, liver) they were placed in 10% formalin solution.\nAfter 2-3 hours, the tissues were divided in half and placed\nin formalin for another 48-72 hours, then the tissues\nwere washed with running water and distilled water and\nnumbered. The samples were dehydrated using alcohol\nwith ascending degrees of 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%. The\ntime of placing the samples in each of these concentrations of alcohol was two hours. After dewatering, the samples\nwere clarified with xylene, then molding was done using\nparaffin by TBS 88 machine; 5-micron sections were\nprepared by a Lietz 1512 microtome machine. Next, the\nslides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). The\nprepared slides were checked to examine the tissue damage\nby considering necrosis, inflammation, number of cysts,\nsize of the ovarian follicles, cell swelling, loss of tissue\nintegrity, increased glomerular space in the kidney, and\ndilation of the veins in the liver. Then the samples were\nphotographed using a Olympus BX51 microscope ( 20 ).    Statistical analysis  Experimental data were analyzed by SPSS 22 software\n(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The method of\nKolmogorov and Smirnov was used for evaluation of data\ndistribution, which was not normal. Therefore, a nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test was used for data analysis\nand was expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The significant level\nwas considered as P<0.05.     Results   Effects on serum insulin level  The serum insulin levels of the PCOS animals were\nhigher than those of the control animals, but the difference\nwas not significant. One month treatment of animals with\ntrans-anethole (80 mg/kg) or metformin significantly\nreduced the insulin levels compared to the PCOS animals\n(P=0.000 and P=0.03 respectively). The insulin levels\nin all treated groups were nearly the same as the control\ngroup ( Table 1 ).    Effects on oxidative stress parameters    Total thiol  Serum total thiol levels were significantly decreased in\nthe PCOS and trans-anethole 40 groups compared to the\ncontrol group (P=0.000 and P=0.015, respectively). PCOS\nanimals treated group with trans-anethole 80 showed\na significant increase in total thiol levels compared to\nthe PCOS group (P=0.001). There was no significant\ndifference between total thiol levels in PCOS animals\ntreated with trans-anethole (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) and\nmetformin ( Fig .1A ).    Malondialdehyde  Serum MDA levels were significantly increased in the\nPCOS group compared to the control group (P=0.000).\nMDA level in the trans-anethole 40 and 80 groups were\nsignificantly decreased in comparison to the PCOS\ngroup (P=0.023 and P=0.000, respectively). There was\nno significant difference between the MDA levels in all\ntreated groups ( Fig .1B ).

The SOD\nactivity in PCOS animals receiving trans-anethole 80 was\nsignificantly increased in comparison to the PCOS group\n(P=0.000). In addition, SOD activity was significantly\nhigher in the trans-anethole 80 treated group than in the\ntrans-anethole 20 (P=0.017, Fig .2A ).    Activity of catalase  CAT activity was significantly decreased in the PCOS\ngroup compared to the control (P=0.000). In the group\nreceiving trans-anethole 80 CAT activity was significantly\nincreased in comparison to the PCOS group (P=0.007, Fig .2B ).

Histological results    Ovarian tissue examination  The results showed that in the control group, the\nmorphology of the ovaries, follicle numbers, and the\nfollicle cell layers of theca and granulosa cells were normal\n( Fig .3A ). In the PCOS group the number of immature\nfollicles increased, granulosa cell destruction (atresia) and\ncystic follicles were seen ( Fig .3B ). In PCOS treated group\nwith trans-anethole 80 mg/kg, the number of follicles and\ncystic follicles compared to the PCOS group was decreased\nand had the greatest effect in comparison between the 3\ntreated groups ( Fig .3C-F ). In groups receiving transanethole 20 and 40 mg/kg, and metformin, the number of\nfollicles was decreased, but irregularities in the theca and\ngranulosa cells were seen (Fig. 3C, D, F).

Liver tissue examination  Histological evaluation of the liver showed that in the\ncontrol group, veins and sinusoids were healthy with a\nregular structure ( Fig .4A ). In the PCOS group, tissue\nstructure was irregular, veins were dilated, inflammatory\ncells infiltration, coalesced vacuoles, and lipid droplets\nwere present, which indicate progress towards fatty liver\n( Fig .4B ). In the PCOS treated with doses of 20 and 40 mg/\nkg trans-anethole inflammatory cells and dilated sinusoids\nwere still visible ( Fig .4C, D ). In the PCOS group which\nreceived trans-anethole 80 mg/kg, inflammatory cells\ninfiltration and the distance between the sinusoids were\ndecreased, and in general, the structure of the liver became\nmore regular and very close to the control group ( Fig .4E ).\nIn the PCOS group treated with metformin, the sinusoids\nand veins became more regular, but inflammation and\nirregular structure were still present ( Fig .4F ).

Kidney tissue examination  Histological examination of the kidneys showed\nthat in the control group the tubules, glomeruli,\nand brush border were normal, the number of cells\nwere normal and the distal and proximal tubes were\nseparable ( Fig .5A ). In the PCOS group, glomeruli\nwere damaged, the Bowman spaces were increased,\ninflammatory cells were seen, and the distal and\nproximal tubules were indistinguishable ( Fig .5B ). In\nall treated groups, the Bowman spaces were reduced,\nbut inflammatory cells and tubular destruction were\nstill observed. Among the treatment groups, the\nhighest improvement was observed with a dose of\n80 mg/kg trans-anethole, which reduced the damage\n( Fig .5C-F ).

Discussion  Elevated testosterone and high insulin levels due\nto increased insulin resistance, hirsutism, ovarian\ncysts, irregular menstruation, and lack of ovulation\nare hallmarks of PCOS in patients ( 21 ). In this study,\nPCOS induction in animals resulted in a significant\nincrease in insulin levels, and the polycystic feature\nof the ovaries as well as pathological changes\nin the liver and kidneys which demonstrated a\nmetabolic disturbance similar to non-alcoholic fatty\nhepatic disease. A significant increase in insulin\nand testosterone levels in PCOS animals suggested\nan association between increased androgens and\nhyperinsulinemia. Insulin resistance plays a pivotal\nrole in anovulation and metabolic disorders in\nPCOS disease. Insulin promotes PCOS metabolic\ndistribution via mitogen-activated protein kinase\nand phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) signaling\npathways. Insulin induces inhibition of PI3K in the\nfollicular cells of polycystic ovaries and reduces\n17\u03b1-hydroxylase, proposing that insulin might\nenhance steroid synthesis through the PI3K pathway,\nwhich enhances hyperandrogenism ( 22 ).  In addition, imbalanced serum oxidative stress\nmarkers in the PCOS group might support the\nhypothesis that there is an early association\nbetween insulin resistance and impaired oxidative\nmetabolism. It has been indicated that oxidative\nstress induced by ROS overproduction might have\na role in the development of hyperandrogenism and\ninsulin resistance in PCOS patients ( 23 ). Elevation\nof the MDA level, and reduction of thiol content\nand activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT)\nin PCOS rats had been reported previously and\nmight explain some features of tissue damage and\nmetabolic disturbance of PCOS patients. Abdominal\nadiposity and hyperlipidemia in PCOS patients might\ncontribute to the development of local and systemic\noxidative stress. In PCOS patients and animal models\nblood lipids and weight usually increase, which could\ninduce a vicious cycle contributing to oxidative stress\nand insulin resistance and play an important role in\nPCOS pathogenesis. However, there is no effective\ntreatment for these complications ( 24 ).  In recent decades the therapeutic effects of medicinal plants, among them F.\nvulgare has been shown in PCOS patients. F. Vulgare oil has\nantioxidant capacities and the effectiveness of the plant in many gynecological diseases\nincluding premenstrual syndrome, heavy menstrual bleeding, menopause, vaginal atrophy,\namenorrhea, hirsutism, infertility, and PCOS have been demonstrated. The main therapeutic\nconstituent of F. Vulgare is trans-anethole. Moreover, the therapeutic\neffects of F. Vulgare on the genitals and mammary glands have been\nattributed to the estrogenic properties of trans-anethole ( 25 ). In this study, treating PCOS\nrats with trans-anethole and metformin, returned the elevated serum insulin levels to\nnormal; these results are in line with the study of Salehi et al. ( 26 ), who found that\ntreatment with transanethole significantly reduced plasma insulin in PCOS rats. The\nmetabolic effect of trans-anethole against insulin resistance might be related to its\nantihyperlipidemic, hepatoprotective, estrogenic and antioxidant properties.  In this study MDA decreased significantly after\ntreatment with trans-anethole and metformin which\nindicates that both trans-anethole and metformin can\nsuppress the oxidative stress induced in PCOS. In addition,\nSOD activity was significantly increased in animals receiving trans-anethole 80mg/kg, which indicates that\ntrans-anethole improves oxidative stress in PCOS rats\nin a dose dependent manner. All doses of trans-anethole\nresulted in a significant increase in CAT activity while\nthe serum level of thiol was only increased in the group\nreceiving trans-anethole 80 mg/kg. The antioxidant and\nprotective effects of trans-anethole in PCOS patients\nhave been attributed to estrogen and phytoestrogen\ncompounds ( 26 ). Metformin might prevent oxidative\nstress induced damage in diabetic patients and have a\npotent antioxidant activity ( 27 ). As can be seen in this\nstudy, in general, trans-anethole increased antioxidant\nfactors and decreased oxidative factors. The effects of\ntrans-anethole on oxidative stress might be related to\nthe IL-6 signaling pathway. The modulatory activity of\ntrans-anethole on the IL-6 inflammatory pathways which\nis an important factor in the pathological changes and\novulation processes of PCOS patients might decrease\nandrogens and improve ovulation processes ( 28 ). In\nthe present study, the number of cystic follicles with\ndestroyed granulosa cell layers was increased in the\novaries of PCOS rats, while trans-anethole, especially\nat a dose of 80 mg/kg, reduced the number of cystic\nfollicles and improved those histological features. Our\nfindings are in agreement with a study conducted by\nYavangi et al. ( 28 ).  Ovarian histological changes in the PCOS group\nsupport other current and previous study results\nsuch as high serum testosterone and insulin levels,\naccumulation of glycogen and lipids in hepatocytes,\nand irregularly shaped and dilated veins in the liver,\nwhich are markers of progression to fatty liver.\nHowever, trans-anethole especially at a dose of 80 mg/\nkg decreased the number of inflammatory cells very\nclose to the control group. In general, rats treated with\ntrans-anethole showed significant restorative changes\nin the tissue structure of the liver. Based on these\nfindings it may be suggested that trans-anethole which\nis a component of the essential oils of F. Vulgare, has\nprotective effects on the liver ( 29 ). Insulin resistance,\nabdominal obesity and hyperlipidemia are the most\ntypical endocrinopathies in both nonalcoholic fatty\nliver disease and PCOS patients.  In PCOS patients, hyperandrogenism resulted in hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance,\nwhich in turn might induce steatohepatitis, abdominal adiposity and dyslipidemia ( 30 ).\nMoreover, metabolic disturbance, chronic low-grade inflammation, and cardiovascular events\n(hypertension) in PCOS patients have shown to be associated with renal injury markers such\nas decreased glomerular filtration rate and microalbuminuria and increase in kidney\ndysfunction ( 31 ). A definitive relationship between PCOS and kidney injury have been\ndemonstrated previously. In PCOS patients, clinical analyses have showed that the urine\nalbumin to creatinine ratio and urinary protein excretion levels is higher and is correlated\nto serum testosterone, which are reflective of injury in the kidney tubules ( 32 ). In kidney\ntissue, mesangial glomerular cells, primary tubules, and cortical collecting ducts contain\nandrogen receptors, so the kidneys can be affected by androgens ( 33 ). Therefore,\nhyperandrogenism and its related metabolic consequences have been proposed as a main factor\nin inducing immature cystic follicles, oligoanovulation, and pathological injury in the\nkidney and liver ( 2 , 33 ). In the present study, in the PCOS group, glomeruli were damaged\nand inflammatory cells were seen due to high serum testosterone levels. Trans-anethole had a\npositive effect on glomeruli and tubules and reduced the inflammatory features in the kidney\nof treated groups. These findings indicate the protective effect of trans-anethole against\nthe destructive activity of high testosterone on kidney tissue. In line with our finding, a\nstudy by Sadrefozalayi et al. showed that F. Vulgare improves kidney\nstructure and kidney function in PCOS female rats ( 25 ).  In PCOS patient metformin was showed to prevent\nmetabolic and endocrine disturbances which are the\ncontributors to liver and kidney injury by decreasing\nserum androgen levels, oxidative stress and low\ngrade inflammation ( 13 ) and also having insulinsensitizing and hypolipidemic effects ( 34 ). In the\npresent study, although treatment of PCOS rats\nwith metformin decreased the insulin level and the\nnumber of cystic follicles in the ovary, and improved\nkidney and liver histopathology, there was not\nsignificant improvement in oxidative stress markers.\nHowever, a between groups comparison indicated\nthat, both pathological changes in the ovaries,\nliver and kidneys, and the levels of serum insulin\nand oxidative stress markers were significantly\nimproved in the trans-anethole 80 group. These\nfindings showed the higher effectiveness of\ntrans-anethole 80 in comparison to metformin. In\nthis study and the previous one, trans-anethole\nshowed ameliorating effects against PCOS induced\nhormonal and metabolic disturbance by reducing\ninsulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and excess\nandrogen and ROS production ( 12 ). Therefore, it\nmight be safer than hormone replacement therapy\nsuch as estrogen-progestin contraceptives, which\nis prescribed in combination with metformin, and\nspironolactone for PCOS patients ( 35 ). Although\nthe safety of trans-anethole at a dose of 80 mg/kg\nwas confirmed in this and previous studies ( 12 , 15 ),\nmore studies are needed to determine the potency of\nthe estrogenic effects of this compound.  Novel insights: Tarns-anethole (especially at a dose\nof 80 mg/kg) improved metabolic status, oxidative\nstress, liver and kidney damage as well as the cystic\nmass of ovarian tissue.  Established facts: Elevated testosterone and high\ninsulin levels due to increased insulin resistance, hirsutism, ovarian cysts, irregular menstruation, and\nlack of ovulation are present in PCOS patients.    Conclusion  These results indicated that trans-anethole especially\nin higher doses (80 mg/kg) has a therapeutic effect\non PCOS induced histological changes and metabolic\ncomplications. More clinical studies are necessary to\nuncover the beneficial effects of trans-anethole in PCOS\npatients, and further experimental findings are needed to\nreveal the mechanism of its hepato and renal protective\nactivity",
