    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction with main\nfeatures such as hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary morphology. 1 \u2013 3 This condition is also known as\nStein\u2013Leventhal syndrome which was named after American gynecologists Irving F Stein\nand Michael L Leventhal. 4 This endocrine disorder affects 5%\u201315% females of reproductive age. 1 , 5 The normal action of hormones\nplays an important role in the ovarian function and regulation of the menstrual\ncycle that maintains fertility. If there is a constant disturbance of hormonal level\nin females, then it will disturb ovary functioning which leads to the formation of a\ncyst inside the sac of an ovary. 4  The clinical manifestations of PCOS may include menstrual irregularities, signs of\nandrogen excess, and obesity. 2 , 4 , 5 Currently, to\nestablish the diagnosis of PCOS, revised Rotterdam diagnostic criteria 3 are used: (1) oligo- or anovulation, (2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of\nhyperandrogenism, and (3) polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other etiologies\n(congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing\u2019s syndrome).\nPresence of two out of three criteria confirms PCOS. The symptoms increase serious\ncomplications among females: 15%\u201320% of females affected by PCOS are facing serious\ncomplications related to infertility and menstrual cycle irregularity. 5 , 6 Stress, obesity, and fluctuation\nin hormonal level are the major issues related to PCOS worldwide. 3 , 6 , 7  Even though insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are not included as criteria, it\nhas important etiologic factors associated with the typical clinical signs and\nhormonal disorders of PCOS. 4 , 8 The results of numerous studies have shown a connection between PCOS and peripheral\ninsulin resistance. 4 , 8 , 9 Insulin\nresistance is characterized by a process in which normal insulin concentrations\naffect glucose homeostasis and its utilization. 4 , 9 \u2013 11 The insulin resistance and\nhyperinsulinemia affect up to 50% of normal and obese PCOS patients. 4 , 8 While obese women with PCOS have\nmuch higher prevalence of insulin resistance\u201480%. 1 , 4 , 8 \u2013 10 It contributes to the\nprogression of type 2 diabetes and increases the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease. 3 , 8 , 12  Although the Rotterdam criteria 3 have been widely accepted, it has recently become clear that dysmetabolic\nfeatures of insulin resistance are a further clinical element that needs to be taken\ninto account. 10 One of the underestimated factors that can lead to insulin resistance and\naggravate it, as well as reduce fertility due to ovarian and metabolic disorders, is\na deficiency of 25(OH)D3. 13 , 14 The authors\u2019 opinions about the role of 25(OH)D3 is\ncontroversial. Some studies demonstrate that women with PCOS have a significantly\nlower serum 25(OH)D compared to fertile controls. A compromised vitamin D status in\nPCOS women is associated with a higher insulin resistance and an unfavorable lipid\nprofile. 14  \u2013 17 However, some other authors\nhave not found evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces metabolic and\nhormonal dysregulations in PCOS. 1  Moreover, PCOS seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian\nand endometrial cancer due, at least in part, to abnormal and unbalanced levels of\nsex hormones. 5 , 9 , 10 In this context, insulin\nsensitizers together with 25(OH)D3 might have a therapeutic and an anticancer\neffect. 5 , 9 , 10  The above-mentioned controversies might be the result of underestimating of\nadditional factors as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), sex\nhormone\u2013binding globulins (SHBG), and other metabolites. 18 In view of the above-mentioned, we find it interesting and relevant to study\nthe severity of vitamin D deficiency in patients with PCOS as well as the\nrelationship between 25(OH)D3 deficiency and PCOS, taking into account factors that\naffect the clinical picture such as BMI and WC.  Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the relationship of 25 (OH) D3 deficiency\nin patients with PCOS with various metabolic parameters (BMI, WC, insulin,\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG)), which could improve the\ntreatment approach.    Materials   Study design  The prospective case\u2013control study was performed from November 2017 to September\n2018 in \u201cD-Doctor\u201d private clinic, Nur-Sultan City, Kazakhstan. The study\ninvolved 81 participants: 51 patients with various clinical and laboratory\nmanifestations of PCOS and control group of 30 healthy women without signs of\nPCOS. To implement the first stage of the study, all participants were divided\nin two groups: (I) case group (51 women)\u2014patients with PCOS, (II) control group\n(30 women)\u2014individuals without PCOS. At the second stage of the study, the\npatient group was divided depending on the WC into two subgroups:    I A\u2014patients with a WC\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm    I B\u2014with a WC\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm.    Eligible participants were recruited \u201cD-Doctor\u201d private clinic, Nur-Sultan city,\nKazakhstan and met the following: inclusion criteria: (1) reproductive age of\nfemale (aged 18\u201344\u2009years) and (2) PCOS confirmed according to Rotterdam criteria. 3 Exclusion criteria: (1) age groups of 45\u2009years and older and younger than\n18\u2009years; (2) confirmed ovarian cancer; (3) severe comorbidity (diabetes\nmellitus, severe hypertension, severe cardiac diseases in decompensation, and so\non); (4) use of combined oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and\nvitamin D during the last 3\u2009months. This study received ethical approval from\nthe Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Medical Institute of the People\u2019s\nFriendship University of Russia, Moscow.    Data collection  At the first stage of the study, clinical and anamnestic data were collected from\nall patients: age, birth weight, and especially the course of pregnancy and\nchildbirth by them in mothers, that is, the absence or presence of\ncomplications, menstrual function, a reproductive history of the patients\nthemselves\u2014the presence or absence of an independent pregnancy/childbirth,\npregnancy loss of up to 22\u2009weeks\u2014spontaneous miscarriage, missed pregnancy, and\nso on, the presence or absence of infertility, with an objective examination,\nBMI was calculated and obesity was calculated by BMI. The study conducted an\nultrasound examination of the pelvic organs on various days of the menstrual\ncycle to confirm the presence or absence of signs of PCOS.  The levels of 25(OH)D3 (ng/mL) were investigated by the tandem\nchromatography-mass spectrometry method, scientific-laboratory complex\n\u201cArchimedes\u201d ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry\n(UPLC-MS/MS) assay conditions: 20\u2009\u03bcL of the prepared sample is injected.\nChromatographic separation of the components was achieved by gradient elution on\na reversed-phase column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18; 1.7\u2009\u03bcL, 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mm 2 ,\nwith 0.2\u2009\u03bcL pre-column filter) using the Waters Acquity UPLC chromatographic\nsystem. For detection and quantification, a tandem quadripole mass spectrometer\nwith an ion trap AB SCIEX QTRAP 4500 (AB SCIEX; Concord, ON, Canada) equipped\nwith a source of chemical ionization at atmospheric pressure (APCI) under the\ncontrol of Analyst software, version 1.6.2, was used. The monitoring of\nindividual components corresponding to various vitamin D metabolites and\ninternal standards was carried out in a positive mode using optimized ion\ntransition parameters (multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)). The measurement\nresults were processed using the MultiQuant 3.0.1 software.  The data were evaluated according to the Clinical Recommendations of the Russian\nAssociation of Endocrinologists: a pronounced vitamin D deficiency of less than\n10\u2009ng/mL (less than 25\u2009nmol/L), vitamin D deficiency of less than 20\u2009ng/mL (less\nthan 50\u2009nmol/L), vitamin D deficiency of more than 20 and less than 30\u2009ng/mL\n(more than 50 and less than 75\u2009nmol/L), and adequate levels of vitamin D more\nthan 30\u2009ng/mL (more than 75\u2009nmol/L).  At the second stage, all of the above parameters were compared between PCOS\ngroups with WC\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm and WC\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm. In addition, biological material\n(blood) was taken from PCOS subjects for 2\u20133\u2009days of the menstrual cycle to\ndetermine the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing\nhormone (LH), on any day of the menstrual cycle, blood was taken for the level\nof anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), TG, LDL, and insulin.  The above analyses were performed on a Roche Cobas 6000 modular platform: TG and\nLDL were determined using the Cobas C 501 biochemical module using the\nphotometric principle, and LH, FSH, AMH and insulin were determined using the\nCobas E 601 immunochemical module using electro-chemiluminescence (E).    Statistical methods  The descriptive statistics of demographic and clinical characteristics and\nlaboratory test results were presented as frequencies and percentages. The\nvalues of p\u2009\u2a7e\u20090.05 were considered to be significant. The data were analyzed\nusing IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23.  To test the impact in this work, several types of statistical tests were applied,\ndepending on the type of variables:    Comparison of averages for metric variables using the parametric t-test\nfor two-independent samples with equal or different variance;    Comparison of means for ordinal variables using a nonparametric criterion\nfor two-independent Mann\u2013Whitney\u2019s U samples;    Pearson Z-test for assessing the difference between two shares of\nfeatures related to the nominal data.       Results  There was no statistical difference in age and birth weight of patients between\ngroups I and II. The study groups were also comparable in terms of the pregnancy\ncomplications in childbirth in their mothers. The complications occurred in 58% of\npatients and in 50% of control group (p\u2009=\u20090.44).  The menstrual function in groups had some differences. In the patient group, eight\nwomen had a regular menstrual cycle, which was 15.7%, and the remaining 43 (84.3%)\nwomen with PCOS had irregular menstrual cycle (secondary oligo-, amenorrhea). In the\ncontrol group, only one participant reported irregular menstrual cycle due to\nhyperprolactinemia (3.3%; p\u2009=\u20090.000).  As shown in Table 1 , the\nstudy of reproductive function revealed the following: (1) in the patient group, 13\n(25.5%) women had infertility problems, (2) in the control group, two women (6.7%)\nhad infertility (p\u2009=\u20090.035). The study of reproductive function showed that in the\npatient group, 14 (27.5%) women had spontaneous pregnancies with the successful\ndelivery, while in the control group, 21 (70%) women had a history of successful\nspontaneous pregnancy and delivery (p\u2009=\u20090.000). In the third patient group (5.9%),\nwomen went through ovulation induction/in vitro fertilization (IVF), which is\ncomparable with the data of the control group\u2014pregnancy and delivery in 3.3% of\nparticipants occurred after IVF (p\u2009=\u20090.609). Nine (17.6%) women from the patient\ngroup had miscarriage before 22\u2009weeks of gestation, while it happened only in three\n(10%) women from control group (p\u2009=\u20090.35).   Table 1.

In our study, the level of 25(OH)D3 was determined using the liquid chromatography\nmethod with tandem mass spectrometry. The level of 25(OH)D3 in the patient group\nranged from 2 to 32.3\u2009ng/mL with the average level of 16.25\u2009ng/mL.  If analyzed according to the Russian Association of Endocrinologists classification,\nin the patient group, the following results were revealed: 13 (25%) women had a\nsignificant 25(OH)D3 deficiency, 22 (43%) of the subjects had vitamin D deficiency,\n12 (24%) women with PCOS had 25(OH)D3 deficiency, the remaining four subjects had\nadequate levels\u20148%. The level of 25(OH)D3 in the control group ranged from 6.78 to\n30.96\u2009ng/mL with the average level of 17.52\u2009ng/mL. In the control group, severe\n25(OH)D3 deficiency was observed in 4 (13%) cases, 17 (57%) had a deficiency, 7\n(23%) women had 25(OH)D3 deficiency, and 2 patients had adequate 25(OH)D3 levels of\n7%. The overall trend of the 25(OH)D3 levels is shown in Table 2 .   Table 2.   Comparative characteristics of the level of vitamin D in patients with PCOS\nand control group.

In the study group, among the subjects with WS\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm, the level of 25(OH)D3 was\nsignificantly lower compared to women with WS\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm. The average level of\n25(OH)D3 in women with WC of \u2a7e80\u2009cm was 13.89\u2009ng/mL, whereas in women with\nWC\u2009\u2a7d\u200980\u2009cm, the average level of 25(OH)D3 was at the level of 19.12\u2009ng/mL\n(p\u2009=\u20090.018).  At the next stage, the level of insulin, TG, and LDL in the blood serum among women\nwith PCOS was studied. The reference range of serum insulin is 6\u201327\u2009mIU/mL. The\naverage level of insulin in the blood serum of the subjects was 13.74\u2009mIU/mL, the\nminimum level was 4.3\u2009mIU/mL, and the maximum level was 38.8 mIU/mL. An important\npoint was the study of insulin levels depending on the WC. Thus, in women with WC of\n\u2a7e80\u2009cm, the average insulin level was higher\u201417.3\u2009mIU/mL, while in 23 women with WC\nof \u2a7d80\u2009cm, the average insulin level was lower\u20149.3\u2009mIU/mL (p\u2009=\u20090.000). The average\nlevel of TG was 1.24\u2009mmol/L, the minimum level was 0.45\u2009mmol/L, and the maximum\nlevel was 4.81\u2009mmol/L. Reference values of TG were from 0 to 2.25\u2009mmol/L. The\nresults of analyses on the level of TG are divided into several groups according to\nthe degree of risk: the level below 1.7\u2009mmol/L is considered acceptable, while the\nrisk of complications is low (cardiovascular disease), the borderline level is\n1.7\u20132.2\u2009mmol/L, from 2.3 to 5.6\u2009mmol/L is considered high, and indicates a high\nlikelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases; above 5.6\u2009mmol/L, there is a very\nhigh risk of complications not only for the cardiovascular system but also a great\ndanger in the development of pancreatitis. Thus, up to 1.3\u2009mmol/L is considered the\noptimal level.  A study of the level of TG depending on the WS showed that for women with WS\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm,\nthe average level was 1.5\u2009mmol/L, with WS\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm, the average level of TG was\nlower\u20140.8\u2009mmol/L (p\u2009=\u20090.001).  A study of LDL levels depending on the WC showed that for women with WS\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm, the\naverage level was 3.0. In subjects with WS\u2009\u2a7d\u200980\u2009cm, the average level of TG was\nlower\u20142.5\u2009mmol/L (p\u2009=\u20090.012).    Discussion  In this study, we evaluated the relationship of 25(OH)D3 deficiency in patients with\nPCOS with various metabolic parameters (BMI, WC, insulin, LDL, and TG). The\ninvestigation of these variables could have an impact on the treatment choice. The\nresults of our study show that 25(OH)D3 deficiency is associated with increased BMI,\nWC, insulin, TG, and LDL levels in patients with PCOS.  Results of our study have common trend with the recent study on the effects of\nvitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity and androgen levels in\nvitamin-D-deficient PCOS patients, 2 , 19  \u2013 22 who found that supplementation\nwith vitamin D reduces serum androgen levels and increases insulin sensitivity in\npatients with PCOS.  The previous studies confirmed lower serum vitamin D levels in PCOS women. 19  \u2013 22 Moreover, the authors\u2019\nfindings suggest that low levels of vitamin D are correlated with a greater WC than\nin normal weight patients. In the study of Gallea et al., 20 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in obese than in normal weight\npatients, suggesting that obesity represents a worsening condition of\nhypovitaminosis D. Our results are agreeing with others studies suggesting the role\nof central adiposity in vitamin D insufficiency. 19 The study of Seyyed Abootorabi et al. 21 showed that vitamin D supplementation for 8\u2009weeks among PCOS women with\nvitamin D deficiency led to a significant reduction in fasting glucose level and a\nsignificant increase in homeostatic model assessment of \u03b2-cell (HOMA-B),\nadiponectin, and serum vitamin D level. The study of Pal et al. 23 found the improvement of androgen and blood pressure profiles after 3\u2009month\nintervention, suggesting therapeutic implications of vitamin D and Ca in overweight\nand vitamin-D-deficient women with PCOS.  Some previous studies have demonstrated that low 25(OH)D3 levels were associated with\nthe presentations of metabolic syndrome in PCOS women. 22 It is similar with the findings of our study where in the patient group among\nthe subjects with a WC\u2009\u2a7e\u200980\u2009cm, the level of vitamin D was significantly lower\ncompared to women with a WC\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm ( Table 3 ).  Another recent study of 25(OH)D3 effects on the course of PCOS has demonstrated that\nvitamin D supplementation for 12\u2009weeks among vitamin-D-deficient women with PCOS\nsignificantly improved TG, LDL, and cholesterol levels, 24 which comes in line with the findings of our study.  However, there are contradictory studies regarding the effects of vitamin D treatment\non insulin resistance and sensitivity. Some study results found the fasting serum\ninsulin and the insulin sensitivity did not change significantly with vitamin D supplementation. 1 The researchers were not able to demonstrate the effect of vitamin D\nsupplementation on insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance in women with PCOS and\nvitamin D deficiency. 1  Therefore, further studies of vitamin D supplementation are necessary for better\nunderstanding of the effect of vitamin D on insulin, LDL, and WC in\nvitamin-D-deficient women with PCOS.  Undoubtedly, a 25(OH)D deficiency contributes to the physiology of carbohydrate and\nfat metabolism, but various studies have debated the relationship. Due to the\nurgency of the problem, an analysis of the level of 25(OH)D3 was performed in\npatients with PCOS and controls without PCOS, which showed no significant\ndifferences between these groups, but a statistically significant difference was\nrevealed between the level of 25 (OH) D3 between patients with PCOS depending on the\nWS. The 25(OH)D3 deficiency was associated with increased BMI and WC. Among\nmetabolic indicators, a relationship was identified with an increase in insulin and\nTG and an increase in LDL. The study showed that patients with PCOS with\nWC\u2009<\u200980\u2009cm had a lower level of 25(OH)D3, which is associated with impaired\nanthropometric and metabolic parameters.    Conclusion  Thus, 25(OH)D3 deficiency is associated with the metabolic disorders in patients with\nPCOS, and this indicates that supplementation with 25(OH)D3in addition to basic\ntherapy can make a significant contribution to the correction of insulin resistance\nin PCOS patients.",
