    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition affecting women of reproductive age, with a prevalence between 8 and 13% ( 1 ). The\nclinical characteristics of PCOS are hyperandrogenism,\novarian dysfunction indicated by menstrual irregularity,\nand polycystic morphology of the ovary ( 2 ). PCOS has a\ncomplex multifactorial etiology, sharing highly polygenic\nand environmental influences ( 2 , 3 ). Insulin resistance,\nwith its compensatory hyperinsulinemia, is regarded as one key risk factor of the PCOS pathogenesis which further enhances the hyperandrogenism condition ( 4 , 5 ).\nInsulin resistance affects approximately 70% of PCOS\nwomen ( 4 ). Obesity and abdominal adiposity, other common findings in PCOS patients, also suggest a strong link\nbetween insulin resistance and PCOS ( 2 ). Clinical evidence also showed that improvement of insulin sensitivity\nprovides various beneficial effects in these patients ( 4 , 6 ).  Currently, treatment for PCOS is symptomatic, and the\nsearch for a single treatment that addresses both reproductive and metabolic abnormalities is still underway. Oral\ncontraceptive pills (OCPs) are the first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism ( 1 , 7 ); while clomiphene, aromatase inhibitors (such as letrozole), or gonadotropins, which involve\novulation induction, are therapies that address infertility\n( 2 , 8 ). Those mainstream therapies alone will be insufficient for PCOS patients to recover their metabolic and\nreproductive health since it does not interfere with insulin\nresistance. Insulin sensitizing agents should be given in\nconjunction with lifestyle management, weight reduction\nand exercise, which serve as the primary therapy for insulin resistance and its consequent metabolic features in\nPCOS ( 6 ). The currently recommended insulin-sensitizing drug is metformin, which is commonly used in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications to target\nhyperandrogenemia and its symptoms, restore menstrual\nregularity, aid in weight reduction, and improve metabolic parameters, with the ultimate goal of preventing\nlong-term metabolic and cardiovascular complications\n( 6 , 9 ). Despite promising clinical responses, metformin\nhas been associated with several unexpected side effects\n( 10 ). There is a significant need for continual research to\ndeliver more options of mechanism-based directed interventions for this condition.  DLBS3233, a specific bioactive fraction of two native Indonesian plants, Cinnamomum\nburmanii and Lagerstroemia speciosa , possesses an\ninsulin-sensitizing property. It pharmacologically demonstrated the ability to enhance the\ninsulin-signal transduction ( 11 , 12 ). Toxicity studies have proven the safety of DLBS3233\n( 13 , 14 ). A previous study on healthy volunteers also reported the tolerability and safety\nof DLBS3233 ( 15 ). A 12-week study in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance demonstrated\nclinical benefits of DLBS3233 in improving insulin resistance, which were indicated by a\nsignificant reduction of Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMAIR), and\npreservation of \u03b2 -cell performance ( 16 ). Another clinical study reported\nseveral clinical benefits of 100 mg once daily of DLBS3233 in type-2-diabetes subjects who\nwere inadequately controlled by metformin and other oral anti-diabetic agents, in enhancing\nglycemic control, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and elevating the adiponectin level.\nConcomitant DLBS3233 treatment with other oral anti-diabetic agents was also proven safe and\ntolerable in type-2-diabetes subjects ( 17 ).    Materials and Methods   Subjects and study design  This was a 2-arm, randomized, controlled, doubleblind, and non-inferiority study over a six-month treatment period with DLBS3233 in 124 women with PCOS.\nThis study was set at the Yasmin Fertility Clinic Kencana, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo, Jakarta, Indonesia, and\nAster Fertility Clinic, Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung,\nWest Java, Indonesia, and conducted in compliance with\nthe Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and\nrelevant local regulatory requirements. The Independent\nEthics Committee of Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia, reviewed and approved the study protocol with\nthe Ethical Clearance (605/H2.F1/ETIK/2012). The protocol was registered with a clinical trial registry number\nof NCT01733459.  Each subject provided a written informed consent, prior to screening. The followings were\nthe eligibility criteria for the study: i. Reproductive-aged (18-40 years old) female, ii.\nDiagnosis of PCOS confirmed by the presence of two or more of Rotterdam criteria ( 1 ):\nhyperandrogenism (defined as the elevation of free testosterone concentration or\nFerriman-Gallwey score (FGS) of \u2265 8, ( 18 ), oligomenorrhea (or amenorrhea) after a negative\nscreening pregnancy test, and the presence of polycystic ovary morphology on\nultrasonography (USG); iii. Insulin resistance, defined by HOMA-IR >2.00 ( 19 ). Exclusion\ncriteria were pregnancy or lactation; hyperandrogenism that was associated with Cushing\u2019s\nsyndrome, late onset of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumours,\nuncontrolled thyroid disease, or hyperprolactinemia; having a medical condition that could\ninterfere with the study evaluation, such as: diabetes mellitus, defined as a fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG) level \u22657.0 mmol/L or a 2-hour postprandial glucose (2h-PG) \u226511.1\nmmoL/L at a 75 g oral glucose challenge test; uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >160/100 mmHg; other\ncardiovascular diseases, such as symptomatic ischaemic heart disease, unstable angina,\nheart failure; acute or chronic infections, any known malignancies; an impaired renal\nfunction, defined as a serum creatinine level >1.5-fold upper limit of normal (ULN); an\nimpaired liver function, defined as a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level \u22652.5-fold\nULN; being under a medically-assisted weightloss therapy, laparoscopic ovarian diathermy\n(LOD), or in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment; regularly taking any\nmedications affecting insulin sensitivity as well as reproductive function within the past\nthree months, such as clomiphene citrate, insulin sensitizers (such as metformin and\nthiazolidindiones), aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole and letrozole),\nglucocorticoids, gonadotropins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), OCPs,\nantiandrogens [such as spironolactone, cyproterone acetate (CPA), and flutamide], or any\nherbal medicines; or participating in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to\nscreening.  Subjects would be withdrawn from the study due to\nsafety concerns, such as hypersensitivity, or clinically\nunacceptable hypoglycaemia (FPG or random plasma\nglucose (RPG) <3.9 mmol/L), or if they took a systemic\ntreatment with glucocorticoids for more than one week\nduring the present study participation.  The randomization was prepared by using the permuted\nfour-block-allocation and table of random numbers. Subject recruitment was carried out according to the consecutive sampling method. Randomization and blinding codes\nwere prepared by the study sponsor independent unit.  The efficacy metabolic parameters were evaluated at\nbaseline and every 3-month interval over the 6-month\nstudy period, while the efficacy reproductive parameters,\nas well as safety parameters, were evaluated at the Baseline and End of the study. Since the study was neither designed to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention nor\nthe study treatment on top of it, general counselling on\nlifestyle modification was provided by the assigned investigators at baseline and every follow-up visit, but it\nwas not strictly controlled during subjects\u2019 participation\nin our present study.  The primary efficacy endpoint was the improvement\n(reduction) in the insulin resistance that was indicated by\nthe HOMA-IR after 6 months of treatment. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the improvements in other\nmetabolic and reproductive outcomes. The former included the glucose tolerance improvement that was indicated\nby the serum levels of FPG, 2h-PG, and fasting insulin,\nand in the lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein [LDL],\nhigh-density lipoprotein [HDL], triglycerides, total cholesterol). The latter included FGS, serum free androgen\nindex (FAI), luteinizing hormone (LH) level, LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, the ratio between\nstroma and total area of median ovarian section (S/A ratio), menstrual cycle normalization, ovulation rate, and\npregnancy rate. The following technical methods were\nused to measure the above mentioned parameters: Glucose hexokinase (glucose) Immunochemiluminescence\n(fasting insulin), Cholesterol Oxidase\u2013Aminoantypirin Peroxidase [CHOD/PAP] (cholesterol), colorimetric\nGliserolphosphate Oxidase-Aminoantipyrine Peroxidase\n[GPO/PAP] (triglyceride), chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay [CMIA] (LH, FSH), electrochemiluminescence immunoassay [ECLIA] (testosterone).  Safety endpoints were at the end of study values of vital\nsigns, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,\nelectrocardiography (ECG), liver function parameters, including serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum\nALT, alkaline phosphatase (AP), \u03b3-glutamyl transferase\n(GGT), renal function parameters, including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Any adverse events\n(AEs) were monitored and carefully evaluated along the\nstudy course.    Study treatment  The investigational product, DLBS3233 bioactive fraction (InlacinTM capsules, PT Dexa\nMedica, Indonesia), is a nature-derived product of the Indonesian native plants, including Cinnamomum burmanii and Lagerstroemia speciosa . The\nextraction procedure and the phytochemical characterization of DLBS3233 were detailed\nelsewhere ( 12 , 15 ). Each formulated capsule of the investigational product contains 100 mg\nof DLBS3233.  Eligible subjects were randomized in a blinded fashion, to receive either DLBS3233 100 mg once daily\n(investigational group) or metformin extended release\n(XR) caplets (PT Dexa Medica, Indonesia) 750 mg twice\ndaily (control group), for six months. The placebos of\nDLBS3233 and metformin, which were provided by PT\nDexa Medica, Indonesia, were administered at the same\nregimen as that of their corresponding active drugs. Each\nstudy subject received either DLBS3233 capsule and placebo metformin-XR placebo; or metformin-XR caplet and\nDLBS3233 placebo. The placebos were basically dummies of DLBS3233 capsules and metformin-XR caplets\nwithout the active substances. Furthermore, the monitors\nand data analysts were also blind to the allocation during\nour present study conduct.  During participating in the study, subjects were not allowed to take systemic treatment with any of the listed\nmedicines: Clomiphene citrate, insulin sensitizers (e.g.\nmetformin and thiazolidindiones), aromatase inhibitors\n(e.g. anastrozole and letrozole), gonadotropins, GnRHa,\nOCP, antiandrogens (e.g. spironolactone, CPA, flutamide), any herbal medicines affecting the insulin sensitivity and reproductive functions. Any other concomitant\nmedication taken by study subjects or its modifications\nduring their participation in the study was recorded and\nevaluated.    Statistical analysis  The hypothesis of interest for the primary efficacy\nendpoint was that after 6 months of treatment, the reduction of HOMA-IR in subjects receiving DLBS3233\nwas not inferior to that of metformin, with the noninferiority margin was set at \u03b4=0.5 points, following\nthe protocol. Sample size calculation was based on the\nprimary efficacy endpoint. Using the type I error rate\n(\u03b1) of 0.05, a statistical power of 0.85 and the non-inferiority margin of HOMA-IR reduction between groups\nof 0.5 points, with a standard deviation of 0.9, ( 20 ) a\ntotal of 96 subjects (48 subjects in each group) was\nrequired to complete the study. A total of 124 subjects (62 subjects in each group) were enrolled to anticipate\na withdrawal rate of 20%.  A full analysis set, defined as the set of subjects that is\nas close as possible to the ideal intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, was analysed for the efficacy evaluation. It consisted of all subjects who were randomized, took at least one\ndose of the study product, and generated at least one data\nof the primary efficacy endpoint after treatment initiation.\nThe safety data set included those who received at least\none dose of the study product.  A repeated-measures model was applied for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and other continuous\noutcomes which had more than one time-point of measurement. Other efficacy and safety continuous variables\nwere compared between groups by independent t-test, assuming normality of data distribution and equality of the\nvariances. The corresponding non-parametric test would\nbe used when the assumptions were not met. All statistical analysis was performed at a significance level of 0.05.\nCategorical outcomes (ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, and\nthe normalization of menstrual cycle) were analysed using the Chi-square test. The data analysis was generated\nusing IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 20.0.\nArmonk, NY: IBM Corp).     Results   Participants and baseline characteristics  Between March 18, 2013 and August 24, 2017, a total of 124 patients were enrolled in the present study. Of\nthem, 106 subjects were eligible for the ITT analysis; and\nthe remaining 18 subjects consisted of one screening failure and 17 subjects with no available post-treatment data.\nThere were 14 subjects who ended the study earlier due\nto pregnancy. Figure 1 displays the subject disposition in\nthe study, with only two subjects, one in each group, withdrawn due to adverse events.  Demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as\nmedical history and concomitant medication, are summarized in Table 1. The prevalences of several characteristics of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in both groups (Table\nS1, See Supplementary Online Information at www.ijfs.\nir) were not statistically different between groups, with\nlow HDL (HDL below 1.30 mmol/L, observed in 71.2 vs.\n61.1% of subjects in DLBS322 and metformin-XR group,\nrespectively) and followed by the central obesity (waist\ncircumference \u2265 88 cm, observed in 76.9 vs. 77.8% of\nsubjects, respectively) prevailed. No concomitant medications in both groups might significantly interfere with\nthe study treatment evaluation.   Fig 1   Subject disposition.

Primary efficacy endpoint (improved insulin sensitivity)  Table 2 and Figure 2 indicate that there was no statistically significant difference between DLBS3233 and Metformin XR Group, in HOMA-IR reduction from baseline,\nat some evaluation time-point; yet, the non-inferiority of\nDLBS3233 to metformin-XR was inconclusive. In addition, the HOMA-IR values at each time point were also\nanalysed within-each group as displayed in Table 3 and\nFigure 2. At any time-point, HOMA-IR values between\ngroups were not statistically different. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in the HOMA-IR value after three and\nsix months of treatment was found in DLBS3233 as well\nas Metformin XR Group. Nevertheless, the improvement\nprofiles in both groups slightly differed. With metforminXR treatment, the HOMA-IR improvement was prominent\nafter 3 months but gradually attenuated from 3 to 6 months.\nIn contrast, the HOMA-IR improvement with DLBS3233\ntreatment was consistently increasing over time.

Secondary efficacy endpoints  Table 2 illustrates the comparative analysis of all continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. The outcomes\nreferred to the improvement or changes of each parameter from baseline were evaluated at each time-point,\nand compared between groups. In addition, the absolute\nvalues of each parameter at each time point were also\ncompared between groups as well as within groups, as\npresented in Table 3.  Table 2 shows that there was no significant betweengroup difference in all secondary metabolic (i.e. the\nimprovement of FPG, 2h-PG, fasting insulin, lipid\nprofile) and reproductive endpoints (i.e. the improvement of FGS, FAI, LH level, LH/FSH ratio, (S/A) ratio), after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Neither was a\nsignificant between-group difference observed in the\nabsolute values of those variables at each time point\n( Table 3 ).  However, within-group analyses in Table 3 demonstrated significant metabolic improvements\nto either DLBS3233 or metformin-XR treatment. Fasting insulin in both groups at Months\n3 rd and 6 th was significantly lower from their respective\nbaseline. The LDL level was reduced gradually during 3 and 6 months of treatment with\nDLBS3233. The reduction was greater in the Metformin XR Group than the DLBS3233 after 3\nmonths of treatment; but after 6 months, the LDL level in the Metformin XR Group returned\nto a similar value with the baseline. The profile of LDL changes in each group was similar\nto that of the HOMA-IR. Further, the improvement of total cholesterol levels in both\ngroups was perfectly aligned with the LDLcholesterol level. Consequently, the profile of\ntotal cholesterol level at each time point within each group was similar to the\nLDL-cholesterol level. On the other hand, HDL levels were not altered at each time point\nafter administration of either DLBS3233 or metformin-XR. In both groups, the triglyceride\nlevel was reduced significantly at the 3 rd month and remained stable up to the\n6 th month.   Fig 2   Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)\nprofiles. The differences between groups and within groups were ana- lysed using the independent t test and repeated-measures, respec- tively.     In terms of reproductive improvements, within-group analyses revealed that the right S/A\nratio at the 6 th month was significantly lower than the baseline value with\nDLBS3233 treatment, but it was not the case with Metformin-XR. Both BMI and waist\ncircumference were reduced over time in both treatment groups. A decreasing trend of body\nfat was observed in the Metformin-XR group, but it slightly fluctuated in the DLBS3233\ngroup. The FAI was lowered significantly from baseline in the DLBS3233 group, but not in\nthe Metformin-XR.  We did not observe a significant different rate of\npregnancy and also ovulation rate between groups\n(Table S2, See Supplementary Online Information at\nwww.ijfs.ir). In addition, the ovulation rate seemed\nnot to improve over the study period in both groups.\nIt seems that Metformin-XR treatment may reduce the\nmedian cycle length between the last two menstrual\n(Table S3, See Supplementary Online Information at\nwww.ijfs.ir).    Safety to organ functions  All laboratory safety parameters showed clinically normal values at each time point, indicating that\nboth treatments did not adversely affect all laboratory\nsafety parameters. Besides, no significant differences\nbetween groups in all safety parameters, with the exception of serum creatinine, were observed at the end\nof the study ( Table 4 ). We observed a slightly different serum Creatinine value between groups, although\nthey were still within the normal range. Further, ECG\nexamination of all subjects in both groups at the baseline and end of the study showed normal or variant\nnormal results.    Adverse events  Most adverse events were considered mild and not\nrelated to the investigational drug. Adverse events\nconsidered related to the study treatment (either\nDLBS3233 or Metformin XR) were as the following:\ndizziness, vertigo, appetite exaggerated, nausea, generalized weakness, headache, diarrhoea, diaphoresis,\nshaking, vomiting, abdominal pain, and palpitation.\nOverall, there was a two-fold lower rate of drug-related adverse events with DLBS3233 treatment than\nthat of Metformin XR treatment, particularly those\ncategorized as gastrointestinal disturbances (Table S4,\nSee Supplementary Online Information at www.ijfs.\nir), such as diarrhoea (21.0 vs. 45.2%), nausea (11.3\nvs. 19.4%), vomiting (3.2 vs. 11.3%), and dyspepsia\n(1.6 vs. 17.8%), (DLBS3233 and metformin-XR treatment groups, respectively). A total of 150 adverse\nevents were experienced by 37 (59.7%) subjects in the\nDLBS3233 group, compared to a total of 253 events,\nwhich 50 (80.6%) subjects experienced in the Metformin XR Group during the study. There was no serious adverse event (SAE) encountered during the study.\nNo adverse events remained unresolved by the end of\nthe study.  One subject in each group was withdrawn from the\nstudy due to an adverse event. The adverse events were\nmoderately severe ovarian cyst, in the DLBS3233 Group,\nwhich was more relevant to disease progression, and severe nausea, in the Metformin Group, which was considered related to drug use.

Discussion  In the present study, we found a significant amelioration of insulin resistance after three\nand six months of treatment with DLBS3233 as well as Metformin-XR. Although, the trends of\nthe HOMA-IR reduction were considerably different among groups, with MetforminXR Group\nshowed a more prominent improvement during the early 3 months, while it was attenuated\nafterward; and also a more stable improvement was seen with the DLBS3233 treatment over the\n6-month period. At Month 6 th , the improvement of insulin resistance with DLBS3233\nwas comparable to that of metformin-XR, with the point estimate of between-group difference\nwithin the non-inferiority margin. Yet, the non-inferiority of DLBS3233 to metformin-XR\nremained statistically inconclusive.  It is widely perceived that PCOS is associated with the peripheral insulin resistance and\nhyperinsulinemia ( 2 , 4 - 6 ). Currently, there is neither the best surrogate index for insulin\nresistance, nor a universal \u2018cut-off\u2019 point to define insulin resistance in a clinical\npractice for PCOS women. However, the HOMA-IR model has proved to be a robust clinical and\nepidemiological tool for the assessment of insulin resistance, since it has a significant\ncorrelation with the insulin resistance measured by the standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic\nclamp ( 21 ). The HOMA-IR cut-off point of 2.00 used in this study was determined based on\ndata from our clinical practice; that was approximately close to those commonly used in PCOS\nwomen of Asian populations ( 19 ). The DLBS3233 efficacy on the improvement of insulin\nresistance was aligned with that previously demonstrated in prediabetes ( 16 ), conforming to\nits known mechanism of action ( 11 , 12 ). DLBS3233 treatment modulates the expression levels\nof different genes, including Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase, peroxisome\nproliferators-activator receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 and PPAR-\u03b4 , while all\nof them are involved in the insulin-signalling transduction that regulates insulin\nsensitivity. The PPAR-\u03b3 and PPAR-\u03b4 gene activation by\nDLBS3233 treatment explains its promising metabolic effects on the glucose and lipid\nprofiles in insulin resistance-associated diseases, such as type-2-diabetes ( 17 , 22 ), as\nwell as PCOS.  In this study, PCOS subjects who had diabetes mellitus\nas co-morbidity were excluded. Therefore, a significant\nreduction in both FPG and 2h-PG would not be expected\neither. Further, no hypoglycemic event was observed with\nDLBS3233 or metformin-XR treatment, suggesting that\nboth medications do not reduce the serum glucose level in\nnormo-glycemic subjects. Specifically with DLBS3233\ntreatment, such a characteristic was aligned with the\nfinding of our previous study in healthy volunteers, which\nreported a negligible risk of DLBS3233 to induce hypoglycemia ( 15 ).  Since the fasting glucose level was not affected by\nDLBS3233 treatment, the reduction of HOMA-IR value\nby the drug was strongly correlated with the reduction of\nfasting insulin level. Our finding of the DLBS3233 capacity to ameliorate fasting insulin level as previously reported by Manaf et al. ( 16 ) in prediabetic patients. On the\nother hand, even though studies of metformin demonstrated discordance in terms of whether the insulin resistance\namelioration by the drug resulted from its effect on fasting insulin ( 23 , 24 ), our study positively suggested it did.  Further, insulin resistance is a central player in metabolic syndrome (MetS). Insulin resistance is highly prevalent\nin PCOS women; therefore most PCOS women are also\nconsidered susceptible to MetS ( 6 ). Of several metabolic\nabnormalities characterizing MetS, we found that lower\nHDL level (<1.30 mmol/L) and central obesity (waist circumference \u2265 88 cm) predominated and were comparable\nin both groups. The predominant low HDL-cholesterol\nbest explains the high prevalence of MetS in PCOS subjects in whom insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia\nplay key roles ( 25 ). Similarly, a low HDL concentration\nwas also prevailing in our study. Similar to previous studies ( 23 , 24 , 26 ), we found no evidence of metformin\u2019s effect on the serum HDL cholesterol level. This study also\ndemonstrated a neutral effect of the DLBS3233 on the\nHDL concentration, which in fact, corresponds to a similar finding in our previous study with DLBS3233 treatment in type-2 diabetes mellitus ( 17 ).  Despite the inefficacy on the HDL concentration, both metformin and DLBS3233 appeared to\ninterfere with other lipid components, such as LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.\nMetformin had been demonstrated to be beneficial in ameliorating dyslipidemia ( 27 ). In our\nstudy, however, while the reduction of LDL and total cholesterol with metformin treatment\nwas significant at Month 3 rd , the values gradually returned to the points close\nto their respective baseline at Month 6 th . Such a pattern was consistent with\nthat seen on the HOMA-IR attenuation by DLBS3233. In contrast, the LDL and total cholesterol\nalleviation were more stable over a treatment period with DLBS3233, resulting in a\nsignificant improvement at Month 6 th . As for triglycerides, the patterns in both\ngroups were similar, in which the improvement was continued from 3 to 6 months of treatment.\nFurther, given that the mean values of the lipid profile were actually within the normal\nranges at the Baseline, it is not surprising that there was only a little room for the\nvariables to improve, in which we observed no significant difference between groups either.\nSuch within-group significant improvement and between-group comparability altogether\nindicated that DLBS3233 showed favourable effects on lipid profile, with a more favourable\nimprovement-pattern than that of metformin. The benefit of DLBS3233 on the lipid profile\ndemonstrated in this study is consistent with similar findings in our previous studies ( 12 , 16 , 17 , 22 ).  The other characteristic PCOS features, such as a higher BMI and an elevated waist circumference were also\ncomparable between groups at baseline. Based on the\nWHO classification on BMI and the Indonesian BMI\ncut-off value ( 28 ), our study population was considered\nas overweight and obese, respectively, at baseline. Both\nDLBS3233 and metformin treatments resulted in a modest, yet statistically significant, BMI reduction over 6\nmonths of the treatment period. This finding was in contrast to our previous DLBS3233 studies in prediabetes\n( 16 ), and type-2-diabetes ( 17 ), which reported insignificant changes in BMI. It seems that the baseline BMI interferes with the extent to which DLBS3233 can reduce\nBMI; where with higher BMI, such as overweight and\nobese, DLBS3233 that acts as an insulin sensitizing agent\nmay work better. Similarly, there was not an agreement\namong studies about the effect of Metformin treatment on\nBMI in PCOS women. Whilst most studies proved that\nmetformin treatment benefited PCOS subjects in reducing BMI ( 1 , 2 , 7 , 24 , 26 ), some studies reported its neutral\neffect on BMI or body weight ( 23 ). Issues such as the\ncharacteristic diversity of the study population, dose of\nmetformin, concomitant lifestyle implemented, and subject adherence to treatment might explain the variation in\nfindings among studies.  We found that the profile of waist circumference at each\ntime point within each group was perfectly aligned with\nthat of BMI. The intra-abdominal or visceral fat distribution is crucial in developing insulin resistance. In our\nstudy, body fat reduction was observed along the treatment period with metformin, which was in agreement\nwith former studies ( 29 - 31 ). Meanwhile, consistent with\nits effect on BMI, DLBS3233 also seemed to favourably\ninfluence body fat, though only after 6 months of treatment. Further, the reduction of body fat with DLBS3233\nwas also comparable to that observed with metformin.\nThis result suggests the potential of DLBS323 for weight\nmanagement in PCOS.  Since there is a strong relationship between insulin\nresistance and hyperandrogenism in PCOS ( 4 , 5 ), amelioration of insulin resistance would consequently favor\nPCOS women in attenuating clinical signs of androgen\noverproduction. This was also the case with our study\nfindings. DLBS3233 significantly attenuated the FAI after a 6-month of treatment. However, differing from the\nestablished benefit of metformin to attenuate hyperandrogenism in PCOS ( 1 - 3 , 6 , 10 ), our study failed to show the\nefficacy of metformin in reducing FAI. Whether or not\nthe non-obese characteristic of our study subjects at baseline accounted for our negative finding with metformin,\nshould still be further investigated. A former study by\nOnalan et al. ( 32 ) reported that it was the subgroup of\nhyperinsulinaemic obese PCOS women who would benefit from metformin therapy. Diverse hormonal profiles\namong PCOS women as well as various assessment methods applied might contribute to the different results between studies.  Hirsutism, a bothersome manifestation due to androgen overproduction in PCOS ( 33 ), develops gradually\nand intensifies with weight gain ( 9 ). Hirsutism is usually\ngraded using the Ferriman-Gallwey Scale (FGS) ( 3 ) with\nthe recommended cut-off value of \u22658 in most populations,\nfor hyperandrogenism diagnosis. Our study population in\nboth groups showed a baseline FGS score above 5, which\nwas actually sufficient to suspect hyperandrogenic disorder. Azziz ( 3 ) reported that an FGS score \u2265 3 defines abnormal terminal body or facial hair growth that should be\nexamined for hyperandrogenic disorder. Indeed, hyperandrogenemia in our study was confirmed by the elevated\nFAI at baseline. The FAI is considered among the best\nbiochemical markers for the diagnosis of hyperandrogenism ( 8 ). Further, the degree of hirsutism is an indicator of\nmetabolic dysfunction severity ( 3 ). We simply observed\nthat aligned with the modest baseline FGS scores, our\nstudy subjects were regarded to have only mild to moderate metabolic dysfunction, which was reflected by normal or nearly normal baseline values of glucose level,\nlipid profile, and waist circumference. The insignificant\nchanges of FGS score observed in our study suggested\nthat neither Metformin nor DLBS3233 had a considerable effect on hirsutism. This may partly be attributed to\nthe modest FGS score at Baseline. The association was\nconfirmed by other Metformin studies which also found\na minor improvement of hirsutism at a smaller baseline\nFGS score ( 24 , 30 ), in contrast with another study demonstrating a significant improvement in greater baseline\nFGS score ( 31 ). In addition, the interpretation using this\nscale should be done with caution because of its subjective nature.  Despite evident hyperandrogenism in our study subjects, their basal LH concentration and LH/FSH ratio\nat baseline in both groups were comparably within the\nnormal ranges. Thus, it is not surprising that both variables were unaffected by either Metformin or DLBS3233\ntreatment. Normal LH/FSH ratios in PCOS patients are\nnot uncommon. Malini and Roy George ( 34 ) observed\nthat PCOS has different ranges of the LH/FSH ratio of\n<1 range to 4.6-5.5, which means including the normal\nrange. Moreover, even though a ratio greater than 2 generally indicates PCOS, there are no exact cut-off values\nsince many different assays are used ( 33 ).  Insulin resistance disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitaryovarian axis, leading to increased LH production, which\nin turn implicating in ovulatory dysfunction and amenorrhea ( 6 ). Metformin alone in women with PCOS improved the menstrual cycle, ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates, with the best outcome when it is combined\nwith clomiphene ( 3 , 6 , 10 , 23 ). Despite the amelioration\nof insulin resistance found in this study, both metformin\nand DLBS3233 did not significantly affect clinical reproductive parameters, such as ovulation and pregnancy\nrates. Yet, the rates of regular menstrual cycle tended to\nincrease after taking either treatment for 6 months, with\na significantly shorter cycle-length with metformin-XR\ntreatment. In addition, there was a considerable reduction of the S/A ratio on ultrasonography after 6 months\nof treatment with DLBS3233, indicating PCOS amelioration. Nevertheless, the effect was regarded modest\nsince the S/A ratios after treatment were still beyond the\ncut-off of >0.34, which was identified as a reliable and\nreproducible diagnostic marker for PCOS. However, the\nimprovement of insulin resistance in PCOS subjects of\nthe 6-month treatment of DLBS3233 was not necessarily\nfollowed by the improvement in reproductive outcomes,\nsuch as menstrual regulation and fertility. This was not\nimpossible because PCOS is a multifaceted syndrome\nthat affects multiple organ systems, and albeit insulin resistance is closely linked to hyperandrogenism rendering\nsome reproductive manifestations including infertility, the\nimprovement of insulin resistance by one agent alone is\nnot necessarily followed by reproductive health recovery.\nTreatment should be individualized based on the patient\u2019s\nphenotypes, presentation, complaints and desire for pregnancy ( 33 ). Further, it is also possible that the dose and\nduration of treatment with DLBS3233 might be increased\nin order to significantly promote desirable fertility.  In general, clinical benefits demonstrated by DLBS3233, a standardized bioactive fraction\nof C. burmanii and L. speciosa , in this study were aligned\nwith several studies of various cinnamon extracts that have been conducted across the globe\nfor PCOS treatment, which reported an improvement in HOMA-IR, insulin level, total\ncholesterol, triglyceride level and body weight. The duration of cinnamon treatment in those\nreported studies varied between 8 weeks to 6 months ( 35 ). In terms of reproductive\nparameters, some studies also reported the improvement of the menstrual cycle and a\ntestosterone level reduction by the cinnamon extracts ( 35 - 37 ). Although there are limited\nstudies of the Lagerstoremia sp . effect for PCOS treatment, L.\nspeciosa has long been studied for its insulin-sensitizing capacity ( 38 ).\nNevertheless, herbal preparations are principally unique. DLBS3233 bioactive fraction\nobtained from a certain proprietary fractionation technology altogether with its specific\nmechanism of action and physicochemical characteristics cannot be identified with other\nextracts derived from the same plants ( C. burmanii and L.\nspeciosa ) yet using different fractionation procedures and technology; Not to\nmention the influence of different agriculture location and practice implemented for\ncultivating the plants on the final extract properties. Consequently, the pharmacological\nand clinical effects seen with DLBS3233 bioactive fraction in our previous ( 12 , 15 - 17 ), and\ncurrent studies cannot simply be generalized for other C. burmanii and L. speciosa combination extracts or bioactive compounds, or\neven less for the individual extract of either plant. Other extracts may possess\nspecifically different biological activities. Bioactive compounds of Cinnamomum species are widely known to possess antimicrobial,\nanti-fungal, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-thrombotic,\nanticancer and neuroprotective effects ( 35 ). Meanwhile, L. speciosa extracts are known with their antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic,\nhypolipidemic, antiobesity, antiinflammatory, analgesic, gastrointestinal, diuretic,\nthrombolytic, cardiovascular, central nervous, hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects\n( 39 ). Therefore, this paper does not further discuss DLBS3233 in comparison with other\ncinnamon or Lagerstroemia preparations, and more focuses on its clinical\nbenefits we can utilize in comparison with metformin for PCOS treatment, as purported by\nthis study.  With respect to safety evaluation, we observed that\nECG, vital signs and all laboratory examinations in both\ngroups did not substantially change during the study and\nwere all within the normal ranges, indicating that both\ntreatments did not adversely affect the major organ function, such as heart, liver and kidney. A slight difference in creatinine values between groups was regarded negligible\nclinically. Interestingly, we observed approximately double cases of gastrointestinal adverse events of MetforminXR treatment in comparison with DLBS3233 treatment.\nBesides, we found more various adverse events with\nmetformin-XR treatment counted a higher total number\nof events during the study. This was aligned with reports\nof most literature that the use of metformin was associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) upsets\n(such as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort), and more rarely, lactic acidosis (particularly in\nPCOS women with diabetes comorbidity) and increased\nhomocysteine level ( 1 , 3 , 10 , 23 , 33 ). Most adverse events\nexperienced were mild to moderate and did not cause participation withdrawal, but one subject in the Metformin\ngroup due to severe nausea that was undoubtedly to be\ndrug-related, and one patient in the DLBS3233 group due\nto moderate ovarian cyst which was certainly related to\ndisease progression rather than the drug-use. All adverse\nevents were followed up until fully resolved. Altogether,\nthese findings generally indicate a more favourable safety\nprofile and tolerability of DLBS3233 treatment than that\nin the Metformin treatment. Therefore, DLBS3233 may\nbe a potential alternative to those who cannot tolerate the\nadverse effects of metformin. Besides, long-term use of\nmetformin exposes patients to vitamin B12 malabsorption, thus, we need a monitoring for signs and symptoms\nof vitamin B12 deficiency. A meta-analysis also found\na significantly increased prevalence of diabetes in women with PCOS ( 40 ). PCOS women with diabetes are at\nincreased risk to develop lactic acidosis with metformin\ntreatment. Those are the other circumstances in which\nDLBS3233 may have bigger benefits for PCOS patients\nand be a better treatment option than metformin.  We acknowledge there were limitations in our study.\nFirst, lifestyle modification, including dietary management and exercise, which are recommended for PCOS\nmanagement ( 1 , 2 , 26 ), was not strictly controlled and\nevaluated during the study. Adherence to and implementation of the lifestyle recommendation would have somehow interfered with the study results. Since the lifestyle\nintervention was not part of our study design, the education was provided only in general for all subjects, without any specific or personalized diet or exercise recommended. Nevertheless, this does not diminish the value\nof this study since the real-life engagement, compliance\nand sustainability of lifestyle intervention remain poor, in\nfact, and thus pharmacotherapy is currently recommended in addition to a lifestyle management, particularly to\noptimize and maintain its clinical benefits in the long run\n( 26 ). Secondly, the short-term duration of the study might\nnot be able to reveal the long-term efficacy and safety\nprofile of our investigational drug. Long-term cohort\nstudies may be needed to provide such data. However, at\nthe moment, our study findings are sufficient to warrant\nthe clinical application of DLBS3233, a nature-derived\ninsulin-sensitizing agent, as an alternative to metformin,\nthe most widely utilized insulin sensitizer in PCOS treatment, particularly for those who cannot well tolerate the\nadverse reactions of metformin. Further, most subsequent\nanalyses in this study should be regarded as exploratory\ninstead of confirmatory findings, since the sample size\nwas not estimated for each secondary endpoint.    Conclusion  Daily treatment with 100 mg DLBS3233 for PCOS\nwomen demonstrated comparable efficacy with twice\ndaily treatment with 750 mg metformin-XR in terms of\nimproving insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). However, the\nnon-inferiority of DLBS3233 to metformin-XR remains\ninconclusive. On top of this, DLBS3233 was evidently\nmore tolerable than metformin-XR. The clinical findings\nof the study will benefit PCOS patients since it provides a\nbroader range of therapeutic options for PCOS.    Supplementary PDF",
