However, the mechanisms responsible for PCOS\u2010driven regulation of uterine HMGB1 and its candidate receptors [toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4] and inflammatory responses during pregnancy remain unclear. In this study, we found a gestational stage\u2010dependent decrease in uterine HMGB1 and TLR4 protein abundance in rats during normal pregnancy. We demonstrated that increased expression of HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins was associated with activation of inflammation\u2010related signalling pathways in the gravid uterus exposed to 5\u03b1\u2010dihydrotestosterone and insulin, mimicking the clinical features (hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance) of PCOS and this elevation was completely inhibited by treatment with the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide. Interestingly, acute exposure to lipopolysaccharide suppressed HMGB1, TLR4 and inflammation\u2010related protein abundance but did not affect androgen levels or AR expression in the gravid uterus with viable fetuses. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, in addition to being localized predominately in the nuclear compartment, HMGB1 immunoreactivity was also detected in the cytoplasm in the PCOS\u2010like rat uterus, PCOS endometrium and pregnant rat uterus with haemorrhagic and resorbed fetuses, possibly via activation of nuclear factor \u03baB signalling. These results suggest that both AR\u2010dependent and AR\u2010independent mechanisms contribute to the modulation of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4\u2010mediated uterine inflammation. We propose that the elevation of HMGB1 and its receptors and disruption of the pro\u2010/anti\u2010inflammatory balance in the gravid uterus may participate in the pathophysiology of PCOS\u2010associated pregnancy loss. Our study comprehensively profiles the gestational stage\u2010dependent regulation of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 proteins in the gravid uterus. Using an AR\u2010specific agonist and antagonist as well as the LPS\u2010induced fetal loss model in this study, we propose that the aberrant regulation of uterine HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins contributes to aberrant inflammation\u2010induced implantation defects and fetal loss during pregnancy through both AR\u2010dependent and AR\u2010independent mechanisms.",

Despite the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCOS, it is undisputedly a hormone\u2010imbalance disease and is characterized by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, representing a substantial health burden [ 3 , 4 ]. Of note, the majority of women with PCOS face a variety of fertility challenges to achieving a successful pregnancy, and women with PCOS have a greater risk for developing several pregnancy\u2010related complications, including implantation failure or defects and miscarriage, which lead to subfertility or infertility [ 3 , 5 , 6 ]. Currently, adverse maternal decidual manifestations attributable to hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance have been put forward to explain the pathogenesis of pregnancy\u2010related disorders in women with PCOS [ 6 , 7 ].  The homeostatic balance between pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory processes in the endometrial decidua is essential for embryo implantation and successful pregnancy [ 8 , 9 ], whereas sustained chronic inflammation in the reproductive tissues is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including implantation failure and pregnancy loss [ 10 , 11 ], by promoting programmed cell death such as ferroptosis [ 12 ]. Several clinical studies have shown that the onset and development of chronic, low\u2010grade inflammation are positively linked to PCOS [ 13 ]. We and others have reported in both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro experimental settings that activation of the androgen\u2013androgen receptor (AR) axis and development of insulin resistance increase pro\u2010inflammatory responses and are associated with elevated inflammation in different cells, such as blood mononuclear, ovarian and endometrial cells in PCOS patients and PCOS\u2010like rats [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated that the overactivation of uterine AR in association with increased fetal loss may be in part due to elevated gravid uterine ferroptosis under the conditions of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance [ 19 , 20 , 21 ]. Despite these important findings, how the PCOS\u2010related manifestations impact specific intracellular molecules to regulate inflammatory responses in the uterus is still not fully understood.  High\u2010mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous danger signal\u2010triggering inflammatory response protein [ 22 , 23 ], and it contributes to the dynamic regulation of inflammatory responses [ 24 ] and tissue repair [ 25 ] depending on its extra\u2010nuclear [ 26 ] and extracellular localization [ 27 ]. Upon binding to receptors, including toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4, HMGB1 activates the nuclear factor\u2010kB (NF\u03baB, a central regulator of inflammatory responses) signalling pathway, potentially providing a molecular mechanism for how HMGB1 contributes to the enhancement of cellular inflammatory responses by increasing multiple pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines [ 23 , 24 ]. In addition to its extra\u2010nuclear function, the nuclear localization of HMGB1 contributes to regulating gene transcription by binding to DNA in a sequence\u2010independent manner [ 23 ]. HMGB1 is ubiquitously expressed in most mammalian tissues and cells, predominantly in the nucleus [ 23 ], and it has been reported that in human and rat endometria, strong HMGB1 immunoreactivity is localized in the nuclear compartment of epithelial and stromal cells [ 28 , 29 ]. With regard to its physiological function in the uterus, HMGB1 plays a critical [ 30 ] but non\u2010exclusive role in stromal cell decidualization, embryo implantation and fertility because conditional uterine\u2010specific knockout of Hmgb1 in pregnant mice does not entirely abolish stromal cell decidualization, implantation or fertility [ 31 ]. In contrast, exogenous treatment with recombinant HMGB1 at gestational day (GD) 3 induces embryo implantation failure in pregnant rats [ 28 ]. Furthermore, increased levels of circulating maternal decidual and placental HMBG1 mRNA and protein are observed in women with recurrent pregnancy loss and unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion and a mouse model of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion [ 24 , 32 ]. These findings from animal experiments and clinical studies suggest a crucial regulatory balance between the physiological roles and the detrimental effects of maternal HMGB1 on embryo implantation and pregnancy outcomes.  A growing number of clinical studies have shown that the levels of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in ovarian granulosa cells [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ], follicular fluid [ 35 ] and serum [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] are higher in PCOS patients than in non\u2010PCOS controls. This significant elevation is positively correlated with the conditions of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance [ 36 , 37 , 39 ]. Our laboratory and others have reported that pregnant rodents under conditions of hyperandrogenism [resulting from chronic exposure to 5\u03b1\u2010dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or testosterone] and/or insulin resistance (resulting from chronic exposure to insulin) exhibit aberrant expression of genes responsible for endometrial receptivity, decidualization, placentation and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, and subsequently have decreased numbers of viable fetuses [ 40 , 41 , 42 ]. Moreover, positive correlations between TLR2 gene polymorphisms and PCOS predisposition [ 43 ] and between the elevated level of TLR4 and activation of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway in the endometrium are seen in PCOS patients [ 15 ]. Given that pathological levels (either higher or lower than physiological levels) of maternal HMGB1 and TLRs are involved in the priming or progression of defective implantation processes and pregnancy loss [ 30 , 31 , 44 ], we hypothesized that maternal hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance trigger uterine inflammation and cause fetal loss through the induction of abnormal HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein levels in the gravid uterus during pregnancy.  In this study, we used molecular and pharmacological approaches combined with PCOS\u2010like rat models to address the following questions: (a) Is the expression of HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins spatiotemporally regulated in the gravid uterus under physiological conditions and in PCOS; (b) Is AR necessary for the regulation of uterine HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression in association with aberrant uterine inflammation and (c) Does abnormal intracellular localization of HMGB1 contribute to uterine inflammation\u2010induced fetal loss during pregnancy? Our comprehensive analysis in this study strongly supports the relevant role of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling in the regulation of intrauterine inflammation during normal pregnancy and PCOS conditions.    Results   Aberrant HMGB1 immunoreactivity is associated with increased uterine inflammation in non\u2010pregnant PCOS \u2010like rats and PCOS patients  To assess the potential role of HMGB1 in PCOS\u2010related uterine inflammation, we first examined intracellular HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the rat uterus and human endometrium under physiological and PCOS conditions. Consistent with previous findings [ 28 , 29 ], immunohistochemical studies revealed that in non\u2010pregnant adult rats and human endometria, strong HMGB1 nuclear immunoreactivity was detected in the epithelial and stromal cells (Figs 1 , 2 (upper panel), 3 (left panel) and 4A ), but no or only minimal change in uterine HMGB1 immunoreactivity was detected in adult rats during the oestrus cycle (Fig. 1 ). Neither exogenous androgens by long\u2010term exposure to DHT nor endogenous androgens by systemic exposure of hCG had any impact on HMGB1 nuclear immunoreactivity in the non\u2010pregnant rat uterus (Figs 3 (right panel) and 4B ). In contrast, we found that compared to controls (Fig. 4A ) cytoplasmic HMGB1 immunoreactivity was increased in luminal epithelial cells, whereas nuclear HMGB1 immunoreactivity was decreased in glandular epithelial and stromal cells in the non\u2010pregnant rat uteri exposed to insulin alone (Fig. 4C ) and in those exposed to the combination of insulin and hCG (referred as PCOS\u2010like rats [ 18 , 45 ]; Fig. 4D ). Interestingly, we observed that compared to the non\u2010PCOS endometrium, cytoplasmic HMGB1 immunoreactivity was also increased in endometrial glandular epithelial cells in PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (Fig. 2A (middle panel)) [ 46 ]. Furthermore, western blot analysis (Fig. 2B ) showed that endometrial HMGB1 protein abundance was increased in PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared to non\u2010PCOS patients. Because non\u2010pregnant PCOS\u2010like rats and PCOS patients show activation of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway and induction of inflammation\u2010related gene and protein expression in the uterus [ 15 , 18 , 47 ], these findings indicate that changes in intercellular HMGB1 immunoreactivity are tightly linked to PCOS\u2010induced uterine inflammation.

Concurrent exposure to DHT and insulin causes endocrine and metabolic abnormalities and alters uterine morphologies at GD 14.5  To assess whether long\u2010term exposure to DHT and insulin alters endocrine and metabolic status during early and mid\u2010pregnancy, we evaluated circulating levels of steroid hormones and glucose homeostasis in pregnant rats exposed to DHT and/or insulin at GD 14.5. As shown in Fig. 5A , DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats exhibit increased total T levels compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats were significantly less glucose tolerant compared to controls (Fig. 5A ). In addition, we observed that the levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, one of the insulin resistance\u2010related inflammatory cytokines, were also increased in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats compared to controls (Fig. 5A ). Using the same treatment setting, DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats exhibited decreased ovarian weight and corpora lutea number along with increased cyst\u2010like ovarian follicles [ 48 ]. Thus, the significant overlaps with endocrine, metabolic and ovarian parameters between pregnant DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010treated rats and pregnant PCOS patients [ 49 , 50 ] indicate that concurrent exposure to DHT and insulin partially, if not entirely, reflects PCOS features both metabolically and phenotypically in pregnant rats. Of note, while DHT\u2010exposed and INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats had decreased glucose tolerance and increased circulating TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels compared to controls, only INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats exhibited decreased expression of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate mRNAs in the mesenteric fat, but not in the liver, compared to controls (Fig. 5A,B ).

Scale bars are 100\u2009\u03bcm.     Our previous studies indicated that early and mid\u2010gestational exposure to DHT and insulin and to DHT alone results in implantation failure and fetal loss [ 40 , 41 , 48 ]. As expected, at GD 14.5, the uterus maintained the features of pregnancy, including the mesometrial decidua and triangle, placenta and fetus in control and INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats, whereas the uterus contained endometrial and myometrial compartments in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed and DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rats (Fig. 5C ). Furthermore, in the uterine mucosa (the endometrium), extensive proliferation in the luminal epithelium was observed in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed and DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rats (Fig. 5C ). Physiologically, uterine stromal cell decidualization is the predominant process of uterine preparation for pregnancy, and alterations in decidualization\u2010dependent uterine cell morphology such as decidualized stromal cells with round nuclei and pale basophilic cytoplasm are seen during early pregnancy [ 51 ]. We found the defective decidual response (referred to as clusters of fibroblast\u2010like stromal cells and the presence of stromal cells with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei) in both DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed and DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri (Fig. 5C ). These findings, corroborated by consistent observations in human endometrial stromal cells in\u00a0vitro [ 52 , 53 ], indicate that in\u00a0vivo exposure to DHT and insulin or DHT alone resulted in implantation failure and infertility in pregnant rodents [ 41 , 42 ] due to the compromised endometrial receptivity and stromal cell decidualization in the gravid uterus.    The regulatory patterns of uterine HMGB1 and its receptors during early and mid\u2010pregnancy  The above results prompted us to determine whether HMGB1 and TLR 2/4 protein abundance is regulated in the gravid uterus during normal pregnancy establishment, and if so, to what extent the dynamics of uterine HMGB1, TLR 2 and TLR4 protein expression change following DHT and/or INS exposure. Western blotting analysis showed significant differences between treatments for HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein abundance ( P  Treat <\u20090.001) and between different GDs for TLR4 protein abundance ( P  GD =\u20090.004; Fig. 6A ). Further analysis showed that the levels of HMGB1 and TLR4 were decreased in control pregnant rats at GD 14.5 compared to those at GD 4.5, while the levels of TLR2 and TLR4 were decreased in INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats at GD 14.5 compared to those at GD 4.5 (Fig. 6A ). Of note, exposure to DHT\u2009+\u2009INS significantly affected uterine HMGB1 abundance only at GD 14.5 and not at other GDs. We found that uterine HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein abundance was increased in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats compared to controls. Despite TLR2 and TLR4 protein abundance being increased, no significant change in HMGB1 protein abundance was observed in DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rats compared to controls at GD 14.5 (Fig. 6A ). Pearson's correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between HMGB1 and TLR2 proteins in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed and DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rats from GD 4.5 to GD 14.5 (Fig. 6B ). We also found that uterine HMGB1 protein abundance either tended to be or was significantly correlated with TLR4 protein abundance in control and DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats from GD 4.5 to GD 14.5 (Fig. 6B ).

The scatterplots illustrate the relationship among HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4, and Pearson's correlation coefficients ( r ) and P \u2010values are shown. INS, insulin.     Using immunohistochemical assays, we showed that in control pregnant rats (Fig. 7A\u2013D ), HMGB1 was expressed ubiquitously in epithelial, decidual, stromal and myometrial smooth muscle cells in the gravid uterus at GD 4.5 (Fig. 7A1 ), GD 7.5 (Fig. 7B1 ) and GD 10.5 (Fig. 7C1 ). However, nuclear HMGB1 immunoreactivity was reduced in the mesometrial decidua and triangle compartments at GD 14.5 (Fig. 7D1 ). Of note, in addition to its nuclear localization, cytoplasmic HMGB1 immunoreactivity was also detected in control uteri with both haemorrhagic and resorbed fetuses (Fig. 7E,F ). We also found a similar expression of cellular HMGB1 immunoreactivity over the course of gestation between control (Fig. 7A1 \u2013D1) and INS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri (Fig. 8A1 \u2013D1). In contrast, immunostaining for HMGB1 was consistently present in all cell types of the gravid uterus of DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed (Fig. 9A\u2013D ) and DHT\u2010exposed pregnant rats (Fig. 9E\u2013H ) regardless of the GD. These findings indicate that the co\u2010occurrence of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance plays a key role in abnormal uterine HMGB1 protein abundance and corresponding TLR2 and TLR4 protein abundance during pregnancy.

AR \u2010dependent up\u2010regulation of HMGB1 , TLR2 and TLR4 expression is associated with the enhancement of gravid uterine inflammation  To evaluate the role of the androgen\u2013AR axis in regulating HMGB1 protein expression and the molecular events related to uterine inflammation, pregnant control and DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed rats were treated chronically with the AR antagonist flutamide. Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (as features of PCOS) in pregnant rats are suppressed by flutamide treatment [ 48 ], and we observed significantly decreased protein abundance of AR, HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats treated with flutamide (with viable fetuses) compared to those without flutamide treatment (Fig. 10A ). Hyperandrogenism has been implicated as a key regulatory factor for PCOS\u2010related inflammation, which is likely due to activation of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway [ 54 ]. As shown in Fig. 10B , chronic treatment with flutamide normalized DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010induced alterations of cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2, an enzyme for inflammatory mediator prostaglandin synthesis, which is required for stromal decidualization), an inhibitor of nuclear factor \u03baB alpha (IkB\u03b1), NF\u03baB p65, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p\u2010Stat3) and Stat3 protein levels, as well as the ratio of p\u2010Stat3 to Stat3 (an indicator of shifting the balance from pro\u2010 to anti\u2010inflammatory responses during early pregnancy). In addition, flutamide treatment increased Ikappa B kinase alpha (IKK\u03b1) and IKK\u03b2 protein levels (Fig. 10B ) and decreased cytokine IL\u20106 protein levels (Fig. 10C ) in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats (with fetuses) compared to those without flutamide treatment. There was no effect of flutamide on AR, HMGB1, TLR2, TLR4, Cox2, IKK\u03b2, IkB\u03b1, NF\u03baB p65, p\u2010Stat3, Stat3 or IL\u20106 protein abundance in pregnant control rats (Fig. 10A\u2013C ). Although HMGB1 is a nuclear protein, it can be translocated to the cytoplasm to modulate intracellular signalling and eventually is secreted outside the cells [ 23 , 27 ]. To investigate the link between the activation of the hyperandrogenism/AR axis and circulating HMGB1 levels, we performed an ELISA for determining the circulating HMGB1 levels in pregnant rats exposed to DHT and insulin. As shown in Fig. 10D , the circulating HMGB1 levels were higher in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats than in controls despite uncertainty in the cellular origin of HMGB1. Moreover, chronic treatment with flutamide normalized DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010induced elevation of circulating HMGB1 levels. These findings indicate that the activation of endogenous AR leads to up\u2010regulated HMGB1 expression and systemic/uterine inflammation under PCOS conditions. Androgens can directly activate and regulate Erk1/2, which are the downstream kinases of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases, in\u00a0vivo [ 55 ]. We showed that treatment with flutamide decreased p\u2010Erk1/2 protein abundance and tended to significantly decrease the ratio of p\u2010Erk1/2 to Erk1/2 (Fig. 10E ). Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that uterine progesterone receptor A isoform (PRA) protein abundance and the ratio of PRA\u2010to\u2010progesterone receptor B isoform (PRB) were increased in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats compared to controls, whereas treatment with flutamide decreased uterine PRA protein abundance and decreased the ratio of PRA to PRB (Fig. 10F ). These findings suggest that an interaction between AR and PR is involved in PCOS\u2010induced gravid uterine inflammation.

Flut, flutamide; INS, insulin.       Long\u2010term exposure to DHT alone fails to alter HMGB1 , TLR2 or TLR4 protein levels in the gravid uterus  Given the critical role of hyperandrogenism in regulating uterine inflammation [ 6 ], we examined whether long\u2010term exposure to DHT affects HMGB1 and TLR2/4 protein expression and inflammation in the gravid uterus. As shown in Fig. 11 , long\u2010term exposure to DHT increased uterine AR protein abundance (Fig. 11A ) and, in particular, increased nuclear AR immunoreactivity in luminal and glandular uterine epithelial cells (Fig. 11B ) in pregnant control rats at GD 14.5 compared to those at GD 0.5. Further, co\u2010immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments demonstrated that endogenous AR interacts directly with HMGB1 in the gravid uterus. However, this interaction was not changed when the gravid uterus was exposed to DHT (Fig. 11C ). Despite no significant changes in IKK\u03b2, IkB\u03b1, NF\u03baB p65, p\u2010Stat3 and Stat3 protein expression, DHT exposure increased COX2 and IL\u20106 protein levels and decreased IKK\u03b1 protein levels in the gravid uterus (Fig. 11D,E ). If HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling is required for hyperandrogenic regulation of uterine inflammation, then exogenous DHT exposure should be able to alter uterine HMGB1 and TLR2/4 protein expression during pregnancy. However, we observed no effect of supraphysiological DHT exposure on uterine HMGB1, TLR2, or TLR4 protein expression in pregnant control rats between GD 0.5 and GD 14.5 (Fig. 11A ). Furthermore, we observed that similar to co\u2010exposure to DHT and insulin (Fig. 10E ) exposure to DHT alone increased p\u2010Erk1/2 protein abundance and increased the ratio of p\u2010Erk1/2 to Erk1/2 (Fig. 11F ), thus suggesting a possible mechanism for hyperandrogenism\u2010induced uterine inflammation through activation of the Erk1/2 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathway during pregnancy. Although the interaction between HMGB1 and TLRs can promote inflammation through activation of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway [ 22 , 23 ], these findings indicate that hyperandrogenism\u2010enhanced gravid uterine inflammation does not fully depend on changes in HMGB1 and TLR2/4 protein expression during pregnancy.

Acute exposure to LPS causes fetal loss and disrupted gravid uterine morphology  We and others have previously shown that pregnant rodents under conditions of hyperandrogenism (resulting from chronic exposure to DHT or testosterone) exhibit elevated uterine AR expression and increased fetal loss [ 40 , 41 , 42 ]. Moreover, maternal exposure to LPS results in implantation failure and fetal demise through the promotion of abnormal maternal inflammation [ 56 , 57 ]. To test whether the activation of androgen\u2013AR signalling is a functional requirement for HMGB1/TLR4 protein elevation and maternal inflammation\u2010mediated pregnancy loss, we first determined whether mid\u2010gestational exposure to LPS could detrimentally affect embryo implantation and fetal survival similarly to exposure to DHT. Pregnant rats at GD 7.5 were treated with a single dose of LPS and the gravid uterine tissues were harvested at GD 14.5. We observed that LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rats had a disrupted implantation process, with a reduced number of viable fetuses and increased fetal loss rate compared to controls (Fig. 12A ). When examined by H&E staining, the gravid uterus of the LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rats had more haemorrhages and more fibrin deposition in the lumen of vessels than controls (Fig. 12B ), which was in accordance with previous studies [ 57 , 58 ]. In line with the findings in control uteri with resorbed fetuses (Fig. 7F ), cytoplasmic and nuclear HMGB1 and NF\u03baB p65 immunoreactivity was detected in the LPS\u2010exposed gravid uterus with resorbed fetuses (Fig. 13 ). The cleaved caspase\u20103 protein expression was absent in LPS\u2010exposed uteri with viable fetuses (Fig. 14 ). However, pregnant rats exposed to LPS showed hardly any increase in circulating levels of hormones, including all androgens (total T, A4 and DHT), AMH, P4 and E2 compared to control pregnant rats (Fig. 12C ). These findings indicate that the androgen\u2010independent elevation of uterine HMGB1 protein expression is related to LPS\u2010induced maternal inflammation\u2010mediated fetal loss.

AR \u2010independent down\u2010regulation of HMGB1 and TLR4 expression is associated with the suppression of inflammation in the gravid uterus with viable fetuses  Next, consistent with our observations from control pregnant rats at GD 7.5 and GD 14.5 (Fig. 7B1 ,D1), a similar pattern of HMGB1 immunoreactivity was found in control pregnant rats at the same respective GD (Fig. 12D ). In addition, LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri with viable fetuses displayed low HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the mesometrial decidua and triangle compartments similar to GD\u2010matched control rat uteri (Fig. 12D ). Uterine AR protein expression was undetectable in control pregnant rats at GD 14.5, consistent with a previous study [ 48 ], and acute exposure to LPS did not alter AR protein expression in uteri with viable fetuses (Fig. 15A ). We observed that decreased HMGB1 and TLR4 protein levels were associated with the absence of AR protein expression in both control and LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri with viable fetuses (Fig. 15A ). Further, no statistically significant changes were seen in TLR2, IKK\u03b1, IkB\u03b1, p\u2010Stat3, Stat3 or IL\u20106 protein expression or in circulating HMBG1 levels, while lower Cox2 and NF\u03baB p65 protein levels and higher IKK\u03b2 protein levels were found in LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri with viable fetuses compared to GD\u2010matched control rat uteri (Fig. 15 ). These findings indicate that AR\u2010independent regulation of uterine HMGB1 and TLR4 protein expression is linked to LPS\u2010induced maternal inflammation, which contributes to pregnancy loss.

Discussion  Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance play central roles in the pathophysiology of PCOS [ 1 , 4 ] and have a strong negative impact on pregnancy outcomes [ 3 , 5 , 6 ]. Presently, no experimental studies have addressed the impact of maternal PCOS stimuli on regulating the protein expression of HMGB1, a modulator of embryo implantation competence [ 28 , 30 , 31 ], and its candidate receptors TLR2/4 in association with uterine inflammation during pregnancy. The findings reported here support the notion that either a direct or indirect effect of AR activation is responsible for the elevation of HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins and the enhancement of gravid uterine inflammation and that higher uterine HMGB1 protein expression is associated with aberrant inflammation\u2010induced fetal loss.  Successful pregnancy requires intrauterine inflammation homeostasis [ 8 , 9 ], whereas aberrant intrauterine inflammation is an important contributor to implantation failure and defects and to repeated miscarriages [ 10 ]. Of note, systemic low\u2010grade chronic inflammation and hyperandrogenism co\u2010exist in PCOS patients after pregnancy [ 5 ], and even after restoring ovulation PCOS patients still exhibit a higher rate of implantation failure and early pregnancy loss [ 11 ]. These clinical data indicate that the disturbance of inflammation homeostasis might cause uterine health to deteriorate, and subsequently lead to poor pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with PCOS. Findings from pre\u2010clinical and clinical observational studies indicate that in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro exposure to hyperandrogenism can directly damage endometrial receptivity and decidualization and can disrupt embryonic implantation in humans [ 59 ] and rodents [ 41 , 42 , 60 ], which leads to increased rates of pregnancy loss [ 40 , 41 ]. Androgen responsiveness in the endometrium is mostly if not completely mediated by the AR, which functions primarily as a nuclear receptor in regulating genomic activity\u00a0[ 61 ]. Our previous study showed that uterine AR protein expression is significantly decreased during normal pregnancy, whereas the hyperandrogenic stimulation seen in PCOS induces AR protein abundance in the gravid uterus [ 48 ]. Our current data indicate that the pattern of HMGB1 protein expression is mirrored by AR protein activation in the gravid uterus during normal and PCOS\u2010like pregnancies. Because hyperandrogenism\u2010induced AR activation has been accepted as a hallmark of uterine defects and adverse pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients [ 53 , 62 ] and PCOS\u2010like animals [ 42 , 48 ], and because the sustained chronic inflammation is correlated with pregnancy loss [ 9 ] in PCOS patients [ 11 ], modulation of the androgen\u2013AR signalling axis has been considered to be an important checkpoint for identifying its downstream targets in association with disrupted inflammatory mechanisms in the gravid uterus. In this study, we show that in addition to decreased AR protein abundance (this study and [ 48 ]) and increased fetal survival in pregnant PCOS\u2010like rats [ 48 ], treatment with the AR antagonist flutamide also decreased HMGB1, TLR2, TLR4 and NF\u03baB p65 protein levels in the gravid uterus with viable fetuses. It has been reported that compared to women without PCOS, the levels of HMGB1 mRNA and protein are significantly increased in both ovarian granulosa cells [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ], endometrium (in this study), follicular fluid [ 35 ] and serum [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] in women with PCOS. While the actions of HMGB1\u2010induced inflammation are mediated by binding to TLRs [ 22 , 23 ], we show here that uterine HMGB1 and TLR2/4 protein levels are positively correlated with each other in pregnant PCOS\u2010like rats. Our recent studies of human subjects showed that TLR4/NF\u03baB signalling constitutes an important mechanism for regulating hyperandrogenism\u2010driven cytokine synthesis and abnormal inflammation in the endometrium of women with PCOS [ 15 ]. Therefore, it seems likely that inhibition of nuclear AR protein elevation directly attenuates HMGB1 binding to TLR2 and TLR4 and disrupts the interaction between HMGB1 and NF\u03baB, thus diminishing the inflammatory responses in the gravid uterus. Interestingly, treatment with flutamide has been shown to increase the likelihood of childbirth in PCOS patients after spontaneous conception [ 62 ]. Consistent with a previous animal study [ 48 ], our findings suggest that the AR\u2013antagonist complex suppresses uterine AR activation at least in part by inhibiting HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling, which prevents abnormal uterine inflammation and promotes sustained uterine functionality for successful pregnancy under the conditions of PCOS (Fig. 16 ).   Fig. 16   Principal scheme outlining our working hypothesis regarding the mechanisms governing gravid uterine HMGB1 regulation and HMGB1\u2010mediated inflammation and fetal loss during physiological (normal pregnancy) and pathological (PCOS and LPS) conditions. (1) There is a gestational stage\u2010dependent decrease in HMGB1 and TLR4 abundance in the gravid uterus, which reflects the shift from the inflammatory stage to the anti\u2010inflammatory stage during early and mid\u2010pregnancy. (2) Combined hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (PCOS)\u2010induced AR activation participates in the enhancement of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling activation and uterine inflammatory responses, while it is also likely that hyperandrogenism induces uterine inflammation through activation of Erk1/2 signalling but with no changes in HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression. (3) AR\u2010independent HMGB1/TLR4 signalling activation is involved in LPS\u2010induced uterine inflammation leading to fetal loss during pregnancy.     HMGB1 protein has been shown to increase AR's DNA binding and transcriptional activity in\u00a0vitro [ 63 , 64 ]. In our current in\u00a0vivo study, we confirmed the previous observation that HMGB1 directly interacts with AR [ 64 ]. However, our findings are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that in the uterus, the expression of HMGB1 protein and its interaction with AR is independent of hyperandrogenic stimulation. We and others have demonstrated that in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro exposure to DHT can increase uterine AR protein expression [ 48 ] and promote its interaction with other nuclear proteins such as melanoma antigen A11 [ 53 ] and nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 [ 21 ]. While our study does not preclude the possibility that short\u2010term exposure to androgens may also regulate HMGB1 protein expression and interaction with AR in the uterus, the precise mechanism underlying the androgen\u2010independent crosstalk between HMGB1 and AR in the uterus in\u00a0vivo appears to be more complex than we originally thought.  The causes of PCOS\u2010related HMGB1\u2010regulated decidual inflammation are yet to be fully understood. As suggested by pre\u2010clinical and clinical studies, insulin resistance can have adverse impacts on PCOS\u2010related changes in uterine function through abnormal regulation of the insulin\u2013insulin receptor signal transduction pathway [ 45 , 65 , 66 ]. For instance, phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, which leads to the phosphorylation of Akt and NF\u03baB in the cytoplasm and further activation in the nucleus, is associated with an increased systemic and uterine inflammatory state (i.e. increased IL\u20106 gene and protein expression) in PCOS patients [ 15 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 ] and PCOS\u2010like rodents [ 18 , 41 , 47 ]. While the extra\u2010nuclear function of HMGB1 has been implicated in triggering and modulating inflammatory cascades [ 26 , 27 ], our findings demonstrate that HMGB1 immunoreactivity accumulates in the cytoplasm of luminal epithelial cells but not in glandular epithelial and stromal cells in the non\u2010pregnant rat uterus exposed chronically to insulin. Interestingly, positive HMGB1 immunoreactivity was also observed in the cytoplasm of glandular epithelial cells in the PCOS endometrium. While embryo implantation proceeds from the initial attachment of the embryo to the uterine luminal epithelial cells [ 9 ], and long\u2010term exposure to insulin induces uterine insulin resistance [ 45 ], the cell type\u2010specific regulation of HMGB1's subcellular localization in response to insulin stimulation remains to be explored. It is worth noting that insulin resistance can aggravate hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS [ 1 , 4 ]. We found that non\u2010pregnant rats exposed to hCG (referred to as elevated endogenous androgen levels [ 18 , 45 ]) and insulin also showed increased HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of uterine epithelial cells. However, in pregnant rats, the change in HMGB1 subcellular localization in uterine epithelial cells was not significantly affected by exposure to insulin and/or DHT. Thus, the mechanism underlying these differences remains to be elucidated. In addition, we observed that in contrast to LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri with non\u2010viable and resorbed fetuses, the protein abundance and/or immunoreactivities of HMGB1, TLR4, NF\u03baB p65 and Cox2 were decreased in the LPS\u2010exposed pregnant rat uteri with viable fetuses. Given that TLR4 is the key receptor involved in LPS recognition and signal initiation for triggering the inflammatory cascade [ 71 ], our results suggest that HMGB1\u2010activated TLR4/NF\u03baB/Cox2 signalling in the gravid uterus is the cause of the impaired maternal\u2013fetal compartment, and this supports the observation that inflammation\u2010mediated fetal loss is common in women with miscarriage (Fig. 16 ) [ 56 , 57 , 72 , 73 ].  While P4 is crucial for modulating intrauterine inflammation homeostasis during the menstrual cycle, embryo implantation and healthy pregnancy [ 6 , 8 ], impaired P4 response (referred to as progesterone resistance) [ 74 ] and increased expression of endometrial PR mRNAs and proteins have been found in PCOS patients [ 75 , 76 ]. Because P4\u2010regulated nuclear PR exists in two isoforms (PRA and PRB) [ 74 ], changes in the relative abundance of PRA and PRB proteins may disrupt intrauterine inflammation homeostasis. For instance, in contrast to the anti\u2010inflammatory PRB, the elevation of PRA protein expression and PRA\u00a0:\u00a0PRB ratio is associated with the activation of NF\u03baB signalling and the elevation of proinflammatory gene expression in human myometrial tissue explants and myometrial cell lines [ 77 , 78 ]. In line with altered gravid uterine Pr mRNA expression in rats [ 48 ], western blot analysis shows that exposure to DHT and insulin significantly increases uterine PRA protein expression and the PRA\u00a0:\u00a0PRB ratio, which can be suppressed by flutamide treatment. Although it is unknown whether the PR promotor contains specific androgen response elements, in\u00a0vitro studies have shown that DHT up\u2010regulates PR mRNA expression in an AR\u2010dependent manner in human endometrial explants [ 79 ]. Thus, these data together with our current findings suggest that hyperandrogenism\u2010regulated PRA may exacerbate uterine inflammation by activating the NF\u03baB signalling pathway and subsequently result in implantation failure in PCOS\u2010like pregnant rats. Further work might be needed to determine the precise regulatory mechanisms by which uterine PRA and AR interact and how both nuclear receptors cooperatively enhance HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4\u2010mediated decidual inflammation during implantation and pregnancy.  One of the hallmarks of PCOS is insulin resistance, which is a manifestation of unresponsiveness, insensitivity or both, to insulin [ 80 ]. Studies have demonstrated that the elevation of ovarian granulosa cell HMGB1 protein coincides with insulin resistance in PCOS patients [ 35 ], and suppression of HMGB1 protein ameliorates insulin resistance and restores normal insulin signalling transduction in human and mouse retinal endothelial cells [ 81 , 82 ]. However, the molecular defects underlying insulin resistance are metabolic tissue dependent (i.e. adipose tissues and muscle) and ovarian cell specific in PCOS patients [ 80 ]. Although we still lack a clear mechanistic understanding of how PCOS\u2010specific insulin resistance directly causes uterine implantation failure and miscarriage, several key components of the insulin signalling transduction pathway have been demonstrated in the PCOS endometrium [ 75 ]. It is worth noting that decreased insulin sensitivity and the development of insulin resistance are seen in healthy women during the last trimester of normal pregnancy [ 83 ]. While abnormal insulin\u2010regulated glucose\u2010induced inflammation may directly promote hyperandrogenism, PCOS\u2010associated hyperandrogenism can aggravate whole\u2010body insulin resistance and vice versa [ 3 , 4 ]. These clinical observations suggest that the defective insulin signalling pathway in the reproductive tissues affected by insulin resistance and chronic insulin excess in pregnant PCOS patients is complex. Moreover, in\u00a0vitro exposure to insulin alone or in combination with DHT suppresses human endometrial stromal cells undergoing decidualization [ 52 ]. These data corroborate our findings in pregnant rats that in\u00a0vivo prolonged exposure to insulin and DHT impairs maternal glucose metabolism, elevated insulin resistance\u2010related inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106) and dysregulated expression of genes belonging to the insulin signalling pathway (Figs 6 and 11C ). We, therefore, postulate that PCOS\u2010specific insulin resistance may dysregulate the insulin signalling cascade and compromise decidual function in association with aberrant regulation of HMGB1 protein in the uterus, and this should be investigated in future studies.   Limitations of this study  The findings of this mechanistic investigation have considerably improved our understanding of how uterine HMGB1 protein expression is regulated during normal pregnancy and what the relationship is between aberrant HMGB1 protein abundance and inflammatory responses in the gravid uterus under PCOS conditions. However, our study has some limitations that can be followed up in the future. Specifically, because HMGB1 can be translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and even released into the extracellular space, in response to different pathophysiological and environmental stimuli [ 22 , 23 ], our current work did not demonstrate how intra\u2010nuclear and extra\u2010nuclear HMGB1 proteins might play different roles in inflammation\u2010induced perturbations of uterine homeostasis during pregnancy. We used whole uterine tissues for our studies, and sample fractionation to separate the cytosolic and nuclear compartments in the uterus might be a useful additional approach in future studies. In addition, we have not tested whether suppression of HMGB1 protein expression by treatment with HMGB1 antagonists (i.e. anti\u2010HMGB1 antibody or BoxA [ 23 ]) alters AR protein expression in the uterus. Lastly, due to the ethical impossibility of directly studying human implantation and early pregnancy, and the difficulty in obtaining the relevant uterine decidual tissues throughout normal and PCOS gestations, an important question is whether aberrant regulation of uterine HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 proteins in our PCOS\u2010like pregnant rat model is similarly relevant to abnormal alterations of these proteins in pregnant women with PCOS.  In summary, our study provides the first experimental insight into the pattern of uterine HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein distribution and dynamics under the conditions of hyperandrogenism and/or insulin resistance. Using an AR\u2010specific agonist and antagonist, as well as the LPS\u2010induced fetal loss model, we conclude that two mechanisms, namely AR\u2010dependent and AR\u2010independent regulation of uterine HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 proteins, contribute to aberrant inflammation\u2010induced fetal loss during pregnancy. Considering that HMGB1's function is to regulate inflammatory homeostasis, embryo implantation and successful pregnancy [ 24 , 28 , 31 ], we postulate that abnormal activation of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling results in increased uterine inflammation, which leads to defective endometrial decidua (through the disruption of endometrial receptivity and decidualization) and embryonic implantation and is thus the cause of PCOS\u2010related adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage.

All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of the animals used. All experiments complied with the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 (updated guidelines for reporting animal research) [ 84 ].  For human endometrial samples [non\u2010PCOS and PCOS patients (the proliferative phase, n =\u00a03 per group)], written informed consent in compliance with the Helsinki II Declaration was obtained, and the research was approved by the institutional ethical review committee (permit number: OGHFU 2013\u201023) of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University (Shanghai, China).

All animals used in this investigation were maintained under standard temperature and light cycles and with free access to a normal sterilizable diet (0% cholesterol, 0% cholic acid and 5.8% triglyceride) and water ad\u00a0libitum . Before starting the experiments, female rats were allowed to acclimatize for a minimum of 1\u2009week, and the stage of the oestrous cycle was monitored daily by vaginal cytology. For mating experiments, pregnancy was achieved by housing female rats on the night of proestrus with age\u2010matched fertile males of the same strain at a 1\u00a0:\u00a01 female\u2010to\u2010male ratio. The presence of a vaginal plug and sperm in a vaginal smear the next morning was used to confirm pregnancy, and this was considered as GD 0.5. Rats were sacrificed between 8:00\u2009AM and 10:00\u2009AM on GD 0.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5 and 14.5. There was no significant difference in body weight or food intake between the different groups in the beginning of the study [ 48 ].    Experimental design  Four sets of experiments were conducted in this study.   Experiment 1  Induction of hyperandrogenism and/or insulin resistance by chronic exposure to DHT and/or insulin. Based on our previous publication [ 48 ], the pregnant rats were randomly divided into the control group (co\u2010treatment with saline and sesame oil, n =\u00a024) or the experimental group (hyperandrogenism alone, n =\u00a024; insulin resistance alone, n =\u00a024; hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, n =\u00a024). The control group was treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with an equal volume of saline and sesame oil, while the experimental group was treated with DHT (1.66\u2009mg\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 suspended in sesame oil, i.p.) alone to induce hyperandrogenism, treated with insulin (6.0\u2009IU\u00b7day \u22121 diluted in sterile saline, i.p.) alone to induced systemic and uterine insulin resistance, or co\u2010treated with DHT and insulin to induce hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. All treatments were carried out from GD 0.5 to GD 13.5. The dose of DHT used in our rats was chosen to mimic the hyperandrogenic state in PCOS patients who have approximately 1.7\u2010fold higher circulating DHT concentrations compared to healthy controls [ 85 , 86 ]. The dose of insulin was chosen because it induces metabolic disturbances including peripheral and uterine insulin resistance in rats [ 18 , 45 , 87 ]. The body weight was measured to confirm that combined hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance was induced by co\u2010exposure to DHT and insulin, as reported previously [ 48 ]. For closely mimicking PCOS patient's ovarian features, pregnant rats treated chronically with DHT and insulin or DHT alone indeed exhibit decreased ovarian weight and corpora lutea number along with increased cyst\u2010like ovarian follicles [ 48 ]. In contrast to controls, long\u2010term exposure to DHT and/or insulin dysregulated the expression of several endometrial receptivity, implantation and decidualization\u2010related genes, whereas completely abolished embryo implantation was only observed in pregnant rats exposed to DHT and insulin or DHT alone during early and mid\u2010pregnancy [ 48 ].    Experiment 2  Inhibition of uterine AR activation by treatment with flutamide. Flutamide (25\u2009mg\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 suspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL sesame oil) was injected i.p. with repeated doses from GD 0.5 to GD 13.5 in control ( n =\u00a06 per group) and DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats ( n =\u00a06 per group). As an AR antagonist, flutamide functions by binding to the AR in competition with DHT and testosterone, and the flutamide dose was specifically chosen because it has been found to effectively improve DHT\u2010induced defects in ovarian morphology and to restore reproductive cycles in a PCOS\u2010like rodent model [ 88 ]. The control and DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed pregnant rats ( n =\u00a06 per group) treated with 100\u2009\u03bcL sesame oil were assigned to vehicle groups. The treatment with flutamide in DHT\u2009+\u2009INS\u2010exposed uteri with viable fetuses was analysed. The body weight, circulating levels of androgens (testosterone, androstenedione, DHT and dehydroepiandrosterone) and oral glucose tolerance were measured to confirm that combined hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance were induced by co\u2010exposure to DHT and insulin, as reported previously [ 48 ].    Experiment 3  Activation of uterine AR by long\u2010term exposure to DHT. DHT was injected i.p. at 1.66\u2009mg\u00b7kg \u22121 ( n =\u00a06), and treatment was given once a day for 13\u2009days (from GD 0.5 to GD 13.5). The uterine tissues collected from confirmed mated rats at GD 0.5 ( n =\u00a06) were used as controls.    Experiment 4  Inflammation\u2010induced pregnancy loss model by acute exposure to LPS. Pregnant rats ( n =\u00a010) were treated with LPS (0.25\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7g \u22121 in 100\u2009\u03bcL sterile normal saline as a single i.p. injection) on GD 7.5. The dose for LPS is described in detail in the original paper [ 72 ]. LPS is a component of the cell wall of Gram\u2010negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , and it stimulates inflammation and innate immunity by activation of maternal TLR4 [ 71 ]. The maternal exposure of pregnant rodents to LPS is relevant to the endometrial cytokine production and placental inflammation observed during pregnancy, which contributes to embryonic resorption and miscarriage [ 56 , 57 ]. Control pregnant rats ( n =\u00a010) received an equivalent volume of saline at the same GD.     Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT )   In vivo glucose homeostasis (referred to as glucose tolerance) was assessed in pregnant rats on GD 13.5 using an OGTT as described previously [ 40 , 41 ]. Briefly, rats were fasted for 10\u2009h and blood glucose concentrations were determined at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120\u2009min after d \u2010glucose administration (3\u2009g\u00b7kg \u22121 body weight in saline, oral) as a 20% wt/vol solution. Glucose concentrations were measured using a hand\u2010held glucometer from blood sampled from the tail vein.    Tissue preparation  Animals were exposed to isoflurane (2% in a 1\u00a0:\u00a01 mixture of oxygen to air, RWD Life Science Co., Shenzhen, China) followed by exsanguination. After carefully dissecting out the non\u2010pregnant and pregnant uteri, placenta and fetuses, as well as the metabolic tissues (including the mesenteric adipose tissue and liver), all tissues were either fixed in 4% formaldehyde neutral\u2010buffered solution for 24\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C and embedded in paraffin for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221270\u2009\u00b0C for quantitative real\u2010time PCR (qPCR), western blotting and co\u2010immunoprecipitation. Only uterine tissues, mesenteric adipose tissues and livers were analysed in this study.    Additional animal and human studies  The uterine tissues in non\u2010pregnant PCOS\u2010like rats and in PCOS patients were collected and used as previously described in detail [ 18 , 45 , 46 , 89 , 90 ].     RNA isolation and qPCR   The isolation and quantification of the RNA and the qPCR assays were performed as previously described [ 41 , 91 ]. The PCR amplifications were performed with SYBR green qPCR master mix (#K0252, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Total RNA was prepared from the frozen whole\u2010uterine tissues, and single\u2010stranded cDNA was synthesized from each sample (2\u2009\u03bcg) with M\u2010MLV reverse transcriptase (#0000113467, Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, USA) and RNase inhibitor (40\u2009U; #00314959, Thermo Scientific). cDNA (1\u2009\u03bcL) was added to a reaction master mix (10\u2009\u03bcL) containing 2\u00d7 SYBR green qPCR reaction mix cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and gene\u2010specific primers (5\u2009\u03bc m of forward and reverse primers). The qPCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 . All reactions were performed at least twice, and each reaction included a non\u2010template control. Gapdh and Actb (\u03b2\u2010actin) were used as the internal control genes for our analysis. Fold changes in mRNA expression were calculated by the \u0394\u0394 C  T method, and the results are expressed as fold changes after normalizing to the average of Gapdh cycle threshold ( C  t ) and Actb C  t controls. All sets of primers were validated for qPCR prior to analysis. This involved determining that the efficiency of amplification using a standard curve of cDNA was above 85% and not different from the Gapdh and Actb reference genes, and there were no non\u2010specific PCR products seen in a melting curve analysis immediately after the amplification or in parallel reactions with untranscribed RNA or in reactions without templates (the negative controls).    Protein extraction and western blot quantification  All procedures were performed as described previously [ 41 , 48 ]. Briefly, tissue proteins were isolated by homogenization in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis and extraction buffer (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) supplemented with Roche cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of protein (30\u2009\u03bcg) were resolved on 4\u201320% TGX stain\u2010free gels (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) and transferred onto Immuno\u2010Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio\u2010Rad) using the Trans\u2010Blot\u00ae Turbo\u2122 system (Bio\u2010Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apparent molecular weights were determined by comparison with concurrently electrophoresed standards. Non\u2010specific binding sites were blocked with 5% milk powder dissolved in 0.01 m Tris\u2010buffered saline supplemented with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1\u2009h. The membranes were probed with different primary antibodies (Table 2 ) in TBST containing 5% w/v non\u2010fat dry milk followed by HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody. Detection of the signal was achieved with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's protocol and captured using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio\u2010Rad). For each western blot, ultraviolet activation of the Criterion stain\u2010free gel was used to assess the total protein loading for each sample. Band densitometry was performed using Image Laboratory (Version 5.0, Bio\u2010Rad), and the intensity of each protein band was normalized to the total protein in the individual sample. For quantification and to ensure standardization across blots, the expression of the target protein was normalized to the mean value for the control group on the blot, and then all the normalized values were statistically compared to assess the effect of the treatment groups as described previously [ 21 , 48 ]. When necessary, the membranes were stripped using Restore PLUS western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15\u2009min at room temperature, washed three times in TBST and then re\u2010probed [ 40 , 41 , 48 ].

Briefly, uterine tissues were extracted with ice\u2010cold lysis buffer. Either anti\u2010AR or anti\u2010HMGB1 antibody (Table 2 ) or the rabbit IgG isotype (02\u20106102, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to 50\u2009\u03bcg protein extracts and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight on a rotating wheel. The resulting immobilized immune complexes were collected on protein G plus/protein A agarose beads (IP05, EMD Millipore Corp., Burlington, CA, USA) by centrifugation at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then washed with lysis buffer supplemented with Roche cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets. The bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample\u2010reducing loading buffer (Bio\u2010Rad) for 5\u2009min and then loaded onto the same gels that were run at the same time within the same electrophoresis unit and examined by western blotting as described above.    Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy  After fixing in 4% formaldehyde neutral\u2010buffered solution and embedding in paraffin, the rat uterine and human endometrial tissues were sectioned for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining according to standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry was conducted according to previously published methods [ 41 , 48 ]. Briefly, formalin\u2010fixed sections (5\u2009\u03bcm) were deparaffinized in graded xylene and alcohol and rinsed in 10\u2009m m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). For antigen retrieval, slides were heated in a microwave oven (10\u2009min at 700\u2009W) and cooled to room temperature in a buffer bath. The endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating with 3% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate\u2010buffered saline for 20\u2009min. After incubation with anti\u2010HMGB1 antibody or anti\u2010NF\u03baB antibody (Table 2 ) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, the sections were stained using the avidin\u2010biotinylated peroxidase ABC kit followed by a 5\u2010min treatment with 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine (SK\u20104100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as the chromogen. All sections were further counterstained with eosin or methyl green (H\u20103402, Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, all slides were dehydrated and mounted in xylene mountant. Stained sections were observed and imaged on a Nikon E\u20101000 microscope (Japan) under bright\u2010field optics and photomicrographed using Easy Image 1 (Bergstr\u00f6m Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The optimal concentration of anti\u2010HMGB1 antibody was determined in initial experiments. The negative controls received the same concentration of normal rabbit IgG instead of the primary antibody. Additional control sections were processed as above, but with the omission of either the primary or secondary antibody (Figs 2 and 3 ). Little or no background cytoplasmic immunostaining was observed.  Immunofluorescence staining was conducted according to a previously published method [ 46 , 91 ]. The uterine tissue sections were incubated with anti\u2010cleaved caspase\u20103 antibody or anti\u2010AR antibody (Table 1 ) in TBST (TBS supplemented with Triton\u2010100) containing 5% non\u2010fat milk overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by an Alexa Fluor\u2010conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After the sections were washed with TBST, they were mounted in a mounting medium containing DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole; Vector Laboratories), coverslipped and examined under an Axiovert 200 confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a laser\u2010scanning confocal imaging LSM 710 META system (Carl Zeiss). The same concentration of normal rabbit IgG instead of the primary and secondary antibodies was used as the negative control. Background settings were adjusted from the examination of negative control specimens. Images of positive staining were adjusted to make optimal use of the dynamic range of detection.    Determination of tissue interleukin 6 ( IL \u20106) content  The intracellular IL\u20106 level was determined by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the rat IL\u20106 assay kit (RAB0312, Millipore\u2010Sigma\u2010Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intra\u2010 and inter\u2010assay coefficients of variation of the IL\u20106 assay were 10% and 12% respectively. A standard curve for IL\u20106 concentration was generated and used for calculating IL\u20106 concentrations in the samples. The concentration of IL\u20106 in each group was normalized to the total uterine tissue protein concentration as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).    Determination of circulating HMGB1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF \u2010\u03b1) levels  The circulating levels of HMGB1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were determined using the rat HMGB1 ELISA kit (ARG81310, Arigo, Taiwan, China) and rat TNF\u2010\u03b1 ELISA kit (YJ002859, Mlbio, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The intra\u2010 and inter\u2010assay coefficients of variation of the HMGB1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 assays were 4.3%/5.2% and <\u200910%/15% respectively. A standard curve for HMGB1 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 concentration was generated and used for calculating their concentrations in the samples.    Measurement of biochemical parameters  The concentrations of serum hormones [total testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4), DHT, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG), anti\u2010Mullerian hormone (AMH), progesterone (P4) and 17\u03b2\u2010oestradiol (E2)] were quantified by chemiluminescence (Beckman Coulter, Inc., California, CA, USA and Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA). The reproducibility (intra\u2010/inter\u2010assay coefficients of variation) of rat T, A4, DHT, DHEA, SHBG, AMH, P4 and E2 were 6.2%/6.6%, 6.7%/6.9%, 6.2%/6.7%, 6.3%/6.6%, 6.4%/6.8%, 6.5%/6.7%, 6.4%/6.6% and 6.5%/6.8% respectively.    Data analysis and statistics  All analyses and graphs were performed using spss version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and graphpad prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The normal distribution of the data was tested with the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. For the time\u2010course studies, data were analysed with two\u2010way ANOVA (including the factors of GD and hormonal treatment) followed by pair\u2010wise Tukey's post hoc tests. The main effects of GD and/or hormonal treatment are referred to as P  GD , P  treat and P  GD:treat respectively. For the systemic treatment experiments using the AR antagonist flutamide, DHT and LPS, normally distributed data were analysed by one\u2010way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test or Student's t \u2010test. Data that were not normally distributed were tested for statistical significance between groups with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test or Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the strength of the associations between HMGB1 and TLR2/4 protein expression in the gravid uterus from control pregnant rats exposed to DHT and/or INS from GD 4.5 to GD 14.5. All values are reported as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. The sample size ( n ) was chosen based on standard experimental requirements in molecular biology and is indicated in the figure legends. Significance for all comparisons was accepted at P <\u20090.05.     Conflict of interest  The authors declare no conflict of interest.

(1) There is a gestational stage\u2010dependent decrease in HMGB1 and TLR4 abundance in the gravid uterus, which reflects the shift from the inflammatory stage to the anti\u2010inflammatory stage during early and mid\u2010pregnancy. (2) Combined hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (PCOS)\u2010induced AR activation participates in the enhancement of HMGB1/TLR2/TLR4 signalling activation and uterine inflammatory responses, while it is also likely that hyperandrogenism induces uterine inflammation through activation of Erk1/2 signalling but with no changes in HMGB1, TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression. (3) AR\u2010independent HMGB1/TLR4 signalling activation is involved in LPS\u2010induced uterine inflammation leading to fetal loss during pregnancy."
