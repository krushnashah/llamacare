    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 4% to 18% of women of childbearing age, characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and multiple ovarian small follicle cysts. [ 1 \u2013 3 ] PCOS is closely related to metabolic and reproductive disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance, anovulatory infertility, and endometrial thickening. [ 4 , 5 ] In addition, patients with PCOS have a higher risk of obstetric complications, including premature birth (PB), abortion, perinatal death, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and cesarean section (C/S). [ 6 ] The current standard treatment methods for PCOS include lifestyle changes, medication treatment, and surgical procedures, but the results are not satisfactory. [ 7 , 8 ] Changing lifestyle is the primary treatment for patients with PCOS, especially for overweight and obese women. However, this is a very difficult task for many people. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is an effective treatment for pregnancy in infertile women with PCOS. IVF refers to the fertilization of eggs and sperm into embryos in vitro, and the transfer of embryos to the uterus to achieve pregnancy and fertility purposes. [ 9 , 10 ] Most patients have incomplete or even erroneous understanding of IVF/embryo transfer (IVF-ET), which can lead to anxiety. In addition, long-term infertility can worsen negative emotions, cause endocrine disorders, and subsequently affect menstrual and follicular development, leading to pregnancy failure. [ 11 , 12 ] In order to improve the fertilization rate, implantation rate of excellent embryos, and pregnancy rate of patients, effective nursing interventions should be selected during the process of IVF embryo transfer. Comprehensive nursing is a new type of nursing intervention that has a significant effect in IVF transfer nursing. This study aims to explore the effects of comprehensive nursing intervention on IVF and pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS.    2. Materials and methods   2.1. Ethical statement and recruitment  The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Dezhou University. All patients were recruited with informed of the detailed agreement of this study and their rights and obligations, and all of them signed informed consent form.    2.2. Research design and randomization  This study was a single center randomized controlled study that conducted in Dezhou University. The recruited patients were divided into control group (n = 65) and study group (n = 65) according to a random number table method. The control group received routine care for the patients, while the study group received comprehensive care for the patients. The IVF, pregnancy outcomes, negative emotional changes, serum and follicular fluid (FF) amyloid related protein and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of the 2 groups of patients were compared.    2.3. Nursing interventions  The control group patients were treated with routine nursing interventions, with specific nursing measures including health education provided by medical staff, and notification of precautions to be taken during IVF embryo transfer.  The study group of patients adopts comprehensive nursing intervention, and the specific nursing measures include: Pre fertilization embryo transfer care, medical staff explaining disease related knowledge to patients, enabling them to have a correct understanding of the disease, eliminating patient concerns, and providing psychological counseling to eliminate negative emotions, building patient confidence in treatment, and improving patient compliance with treatment. During the ovulation promotion period, medical staff communicate with patients before applying ovulation promoting drugs, explain the medication method, dosage, precautions, and potential adverse reactions. During the ovulation promotion period, medical staff closely monitor the patient health status and take timely measures to address any adverse reactions. Nursing during egg retrieval: Medical staff explain to patients the precautions to be taken during egg retrieval, make them mentally prepared, closely observe the patient vital signs during egg retrieval, and promptly inform the patient of the egg retrieval situation to eliminate their doubts. During embryo transfer, the medical staff introduced the situation of the attending physician to the patient, including the successful experience of the transfer, so as to increase the patient trust in the doctor and improve the degree of cooperation. After the transfer, the medical staff instructed the patient to pay attention to the dietary habits, eat reasonably, maintain adequate nutrition, instruct the patient to prohibit sexual life, and conduct regular reexamination.    2.4. Indicator observation    Cognitive level .[ 13 , 14 ] Referring to relevant literature, a self-designed cognitive questionnaire was developed to evaluate the patient cognitive status before and after intervention, covering 5 items including IVF related examinations, ovulation induction therapy, egg retrieval surgery, embryo transfer surgery, and complications. Each item had 10 questions, and each question was scored 0 to 2 points, with a total score of 100 points. The higher the score, the higher the cognitive level.    Pregnancy outcomes .[ 15 ] This includes the rate of blastocyst superiority, fertilization rate, and clinical pregnancy rate. The evaluation of excellent blastocyst rate refers to the method proposed by Gardner. The evaluation standard is mainly 4 stage blastocysts. The blastocysts with inner cell mass score of B or above and the blastocysts with trophoblast ectoderm score of B or above are high-quality embryos.    Negative emotions. Compare the psychological status of patients before and after treatment using Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) .[ 16 ]    Serum and FF amyloid protein related protein levels. [ 17 ] Collect FF from the first entered follicle, with a follicle size of \u226518\u2009mm, and remove oocytes from it. No flushing was performed. Blood and FF samples from 78 patients were centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm for 15 minutes on the day of follicle puncture and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for 5 months for subsequent analysis. Each sample is masked for blind analysis. Measure amyloid-associated (AA) levels in serum and FF using the Human serum amyloid protein A (SAA) ELISA Kit (CloudCloneCorp, USA) for quantitative detection of AA in serum, plasma, and other biological fluids. The detection range of the reagent kit is between 0.312 and 20\u2009ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 0.125\u2009ng/mL. The total intra batch and inter batch variation coefficients calculated are <10% and <12%, respectively. Perform ELISA testing according to the manufacturer protocol and guidelines.    High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. [ 18 ] Before and after intervention, 4\u2009mL of fasting venous blood was collected from the 2 groups, of which 2\u2009mL was anticoagulated, and ESR was detected by automatic erythrocyte sedimentation rate; Take another 2\u2009mL of serum by centrifugation (at a rate of 3000 r/min for 10\u2009min), and use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the serum CRP levels of the 2 groups of patients.      2.5. Statistic analysis  Data analyzed using statistical software SPSS 22.0. The count data were represented as n (%), and x 2 test was used. The measurement data were represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and t test was used. P < .05 was defined as the standard for statistical significance.     3. Results   3.1. Baseline information  Among the 65 patients in the study group, the maximum age was 36 years, the minimum age was 23 years, the average age was (27.35\u2009\u00b1\u20091.83) years, the shortest course was 0.5 year, the longest course was 3 years, and the average course was (1.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56) years. Among the 65 patients in the control group, the maximum age was 35 years, the minimum age was 24 years, the average age was (28.68\u2009\u00b1\u20091.62) years, the shortest course was 1.5 months, the longest course was 3.5 years, and the average course was (1.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69) years, there was no significant difference in general information between the study group and the control group.    3.2. Cognitive level  As shown in Table 1 , there was no statistically significant difference in IVF-ET related examinations, ovulation induction therapy, egg retrieval surgery, embryo transfer surgery, and complication cognition scores between the 2 groups of patients before intervention ( P > .05).

Discussion  The clinical incidence rate of PCOS is close to 10%. In addition to symptoms such as menstrual disorder, it may also cause anovulation and infertility. With the growing development of medical technology and assisted reproductive technology, most PCOS infertility patients can use IVF-ET technology to assist pregnancy, but many women with PCOS can accept IVF and embryo transfer to complete pregnancy. [ 19 \u2013 21 ] However, due to the inherent disruption of the metabolic system and endocrine system, the process of promoting ovulation is highly susceptible to external environmental influences, ultimately leading to altered pregnancy outcomes. [ 22 ] In the process of treating patients with PCOS, it is necessary for them to face and cooperate with a positive and optimistic attitude to avoid adverse emotions and stress reactions. The fluctuation of their emotions can directly cause abnormal secretion of sex hormones, which is not conducive to egg cell quality. [ 23 , 24 ]  A survey shows that patients undergoing IVF-ET have a very urgent need for health education. [ 25 , 26 ] Providing health information to such patients to meet their health education needs is a key task for assisted reproductive care personnel. However, routine nursing is prone to missing out on health education content, and there are shortcomings such as formalized work, incomplete content, and lack of specificity when conducting health education. There is a lack of systematization, and patients cannot grasp the education content. Patients passively receive health information infusion, do not understand their own lack of knowledge, and the nursing effect does not reach the ideal level. Through comprehensive nursing intervention, it is possible to effectively face the complex steps mentioned above, stabilize the mother emotions, clarify the treatment details and procedures, and implement appropriate intervention measures when patients experience different emotions at different stages to ensure their safe and stable completion of the pregnancy process. At the same time, phased nursing provides patients with more detailed care from different levels, allowing them to feel the care of their family and medical staff throughout the entire treatment process, which is beneficial for patients to enhance their confidence in treatment and improve their compliance with clinical treatment.  In summary, for patients with PCOS, receiving comprehensive care can increase their probability of IVF, improve their pregnancy outcomes, and have a positive significance in reducing negative emotions.
