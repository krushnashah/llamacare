    "body": "AJOG Global Reports at a Glance Why was this study conducted? Currently, there is confusion over the classification of menstruation issues in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It is unknown whether the timing of the onset of menstrual disturbance has an effect on the clinical features and in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy outcomes in individuals with PCOS. Key findings Early onset of menstrual disturbance in patients with PCOS had more severe reproductive features, better glucose and lipid metabolic profiles, and similar pregnancy outcomes after IVF compared with late onset of menstrual disturbance. What does this add to what is known? Our study has important clinical implications for the individualization of care for patients with PCOS, as it can provide relevant counseling to patients.    Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous condition with endocrine and reproductive alterations. The prevalence of PCOS is 8% to 13% in reproductive-aged women. 1 , 2 There have been several diagnostic criteria and various phenotypes described with different combinations of diagnostic items. 3 , 4 , 5 The precise classification of patients with PCOS into various subgroups based on clinical manifestations and/or genetic analysis is still controversial and subject to intense study. 6 , 7  Currently, the etiology of PCOS remains unclear, but there is increasing evidence supporting a genetic basis, 7 with interactions with environmental factors. 8 , 9 , 10 It is hypothesized that PCOS originates from puberty or even from in utero. 11 , 12 However, the occurrence of clinical symptoms varies greatly among patients with PCOS. 13 , 14 , 15 Menstrual disturbance is the most common clinical presentation of PCOS, with approximately 80% of patients experiencing oligomenorrhea. 16 However, the onset time of menstrual disturbance in patients with PCOS varies from menarche to adulthood. 17 , 18 A previous comparison between 49 women whose menstrual irregularity started at menarche and 40 women whose menstrual irregularity started in adult life showed no difference in hormonal and metabolic profiles. 17 However, the association between the onset time of menstrual disturbance and metabolism has not been investigated in studies involving larger cohorts.  Most females can establish a regular menstrual cycle within 1 to 3 years after menarche. 19 , 20 , 21 Regular and predictable ovulatory cycles usually occur within 5 years after menarche as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures. 22 In addition, the HPO axis is influenced by metabolic factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. 23 Even after the establishment of a regular menstrual cycle, metabolic alterations can still lead to ovulation and menstrual irregularities. 24 Therefore, menstrual patterns are suggested to reflect the severity of metabolic disorders. 13 Unfortunately, it is still unclear whether the timing of the onset of menstrual disturbance is associated with clinical features and pregnancy outcomes.  We previously conducted a randomized trial in 1508 patients with PCOS who underwent their first cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Menstruation-related variables, prepregnancy clinical features, and pregnancy outcomes after the first embryo transfer cycle were prospectively collected using standard case report forms. Here, we compared the clinical features and IVF pregnancy outcomes between individuals with early and late onset of menstrual disturbances.    Materials and Methods   Study design  This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial. The original trial compared the live birth rate between fresh embryo transfer and frozen embryo transfer in 1508 patients with PCOS (registration number: NCT01841528; registered on April 26, 2013). It has been approved by the ethics committee of the Center for Reproductive Medicine Affiliated with Shandong University and all other study sites (ethical approval number: 2012-15; approved on April 15, 2012). Written informed consent forms were signed by all participants. Both the study's protocol and its main findings have already been published. 25 , 26    Study population  A total of 1508 patients with PCOS from 14 Chinese reproductive medical centers were enrolled to undergo their first IVF cycle between June 2013 and May 2014. Here, the participants were between the ages of 20 and 35 years old. PCOS was diagnosed by modified Rotterdam criteria, that is, presence of menstrual disorder, which is an essential condition along with either hyperandrogenism (either hirsutism or hyperandrogenemia) or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Other exclusion criteria included couples with abnormal karyotypes, recurrent spontaneous abortion characterized as 3 or more previous spontaneous pregnancy losses, women with a history of unilateral oophorectomy, women with uterine anomalies, or women with contraindications to assisted reproductive technology and/or pregnancy.  Patients were classified into 2 groups according to the onset time of menstrual disturbance. In the early-onset group (early group), menstrual irregularities occurred from menarche, whereas, in the late-onset group (late group), the irregularities occurred after at least 1 year of regular menstruation.    Study procedures  The menstruation and medical history were collected using a standard form. The age of menarche, the age of onset of menstrual irregularity, and the pattern of menstruation were reported by patients and were recorded in face-to-face interviews by investigators. Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus, and hip circumference was measured at the widest diameter. A hirsutism assessment was made via the modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score 27 by trained investigating doctors.  All of the participants received a standardized recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist ovarian stimulation protocol and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger for final oocyte maturation because the randomization was performed on the day of oocyte retrieval in the original trial. GnRH antagonist at a daily dose of 250 ug started when at least 1 follicle is \u226512 mm in mean diameter until trigger day. An hCG trigger was administered when there were 2 or more follicles with a diameter \u226518 mm, and approximately 36 hours later, a standard ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval procedure was performed. Eligible patients with 3 to 30 oocytes who did not have a high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were randomized to either frozen or fresh embryo transfer on the day of oocyte retrieval.  Both groups received up to 2 cleavage-stage embryo transfers. Individuals in the fresh embryo transfer group received daily intramuscular progesterone administrations of 80 mg from the day of oocyte retrieval. In the frozen embryo transfer group, endometrial preparation was performed using a programmed regimen. Intramuscular progesterone at a dose of 80 mg per day was administered when endometrial thickness reached 8 mm. On the fourth day of progesterone administration, embryo transfer and thawing were performed. If pregnancy was confirmed, luteal phase support was continued until 10 to 11 weeks of gestation.    Outcome measures  The outcomes included clinical features and pregnancy outcomes. The conception rate was defined as a blood \u03b2-hCG level of 10 IU/L 2 weeks after embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy was defined as the detection of an intrauterine gestational sac by transvaginal ultrasonography after 6 weeks of embryo transfer. According to national standards of care and government guidelines for the management of preterm infants and to ensure consistency in tracking pregnancy outcomes during the original trial, live birth was defined as the delivery of a viable infant after 28 weeks of gestation, whereas miscarriage was defined as the loss of pregnancy at <28 weeks of gestation.  In addition, obstetrical and neonatal complications were assessed. This included preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and premature rupture of membranes (PROM) based on data obtained from obstetrical medical records. Large for gestational age was defined as a birthweight above the 90th percentile of the birthweight for the gestational age. Small for gestational age was defined as a birthweight below the 10th percentile of birthweight for the gestational age. Birthweight percentiles were based on Chinese population data based on recent birthweight surveys. 28 , 29 , 30    Statistical analysis  Continuous variables conforming to a normal distribution were presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation; otherwise, they were presented as median and interquartile range. Categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage. Continuous variables that conform to a normal distribution were analyzed using the Student t test, whereas those that do not conform to a normal distribution were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were assessed using \u03c7\u00b2 analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the between-group difference in pregnancy outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count (AFC), luteinizing hormone (LH), LH-to-follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting blood glucose, high-density cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), estradiol level on hCG administration day, endometrial thickness on the day of hCG administration, fertilization mode, endometrial thickness before embryo transfer, the number of embryos transferred, and the types of embryo transfer. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 26.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A P value of <.05 was considered as statistically significant.     Results  A total of 8 patients with an unknown history of menstrual disturbance were excluded, and a total of 1500 individuals with PCOS were included in the study. The early group had 540 patients (36%), whereas the late group had 960 patients (64%).  The clinical characteristics and variables during the IVF process in groups with different onsets of menstrual disturbance are displayed in Tables 1 and 2 , correspondingly. Patients in the early group were slightly older than the late group (27.5 years [range, 25.0\u201330.0] vs 27.0 years [range, 25.3\u201330.0], respectively; P =.014). There was no statistical significance in BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, age of menarche, or duration of infertility. Patients in the early group had a greater number of antral follicles (32.0 [range, 27.3\u201339.5] vs 28.0 [range, 24.0\u201336.0]; P <.001) and higher levels of the antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH; 7.0 ng/mL [range, 3.6\u201311.5] vs 5.7 ng/mL [range, 3.7\u20138.9]; P =.024), LH (10.0\u00b15.9 vs 8.5\u00b15.5 IU/L; P <.001), LH-to-FSH ratio (1.5 [range, 1.0\u20132.3] vs 1.4 [range, 0.9\u20132.1]; P <.001), TSH (2.6 \u00b5IU/mL [range, 1.8\u20133.5] vs 2.4 \u00b5IU/mL [range, 1.7\u20133.2]; P =.001), TC (4.7 mmol/L [range, 4.2\u20135.2] vs 4.6 mmol/L [range, 4.1\u20135.1]; P =.021), and HDL (1.3 mmol/L [range, 1.0\u20131.4] vs 1.2 mmol/L [range, 1.1\u20131.5]; P =.006) than people in the late group ( Table 1 ).

Comment   Principal findings  The timing of the onset of menstrual disturbance in patients with PCOS did not affect the success of their IVF pregnancy outcomes.    Results  This study suggested that early onset of menstrual disturbance in patients with PCOS was associated with more severe reproductive features, such as more AFC; higher levels of AMH, LH, and LH-to-FSH ratio; and milder metabolic features, such as lower levels of fasting glucose and 2-hour insulin and a higher level of HDL, than late onset of menstrual disturbance. However, the outcomes of IVF and the initial cycle of embryo transfer were comparable between the 2 groups.    Clinical implications  Few studies focus on the association of the onset time of menstrual disturbance with clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS. A previous study of 89 individuals with PCOS suggested that the onset time of menstrual irregularities was not associated with hormonal or metabolic profile and ovarian ultrasound morphology. 17 In this study with a much larger sample size, we found that an early onset of menstrual disturbances was related to more antral follicles and higher AMH, LH, LH-to-FSH ratios, TC, and TSH levels. These findings supported the neuroendocrine basis in the etiology of PCOS with an early onset of menstrual disturbance. 31 Approximately half of adolescents with oligomenorrhea are diagnosed with PCOS. 17 , 32 , 33 In addition, dysregulation of the HPO axis, represented by the raised LH levels, was found to be presented in most adolescents with oligomenorrhea. 17 In adolescents with oligomenorrhea, those with normal plasma LH levels at 2 years after menarche had a greater probability of spontaneous ovulation within the following 40 months than those with high LH levels. 34 However, the effect of elevated LH on the quality of oocytes and embryos and pregnancy outcomes remains unclear. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that found that basal LH levels did not affect the pregnancy outcomes after IVF in patients with PCOS. 35 Moreover, the current study showed that patients with PCOS and an early-onset time of menstrual disturbance had a higher level of AMH. AMH is one of the predictors of ovarian reserve 36 and ovarian response in assisted reproductive technology. 37 Moreover, AMH is suggested to be related to the severity of PCOS. 38 , 39 A previous study found that AMH levels are higher in patients with PCOS and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea than in those without dysmenorrhea, 40 suggesting a role for AMH in the pathogenic mechanism of anovulation. 41 Furthermore, we found that patients with a late onset of menstrual disturbance exhibited slightly higher serum PRL levels than those with an early onset of menstrual disturbance. However, the difference may be clinically insignificant.  We found that the late onset of menstrual disturbance in patients with PCOS was associated with poor glucose and lipid metabolic profiles and a higher 2-hour insulin level after 75-g OGTT. The findings suggested that metabolic factors may play a greater role in patients with a late onset of menstrual disturbance than in patients with an early onset of menstrual disturbance. However, the absolute between-group differences in the levels of glucose and insulin were slight, and the clinical significance of these small differences should be confirmed in further studies. Previous studies indicated that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in people with polycystic ovaries was nearly 2-fold higher than in the general population. 42 The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with PCOS was 27.2%, 43 which supported the relationship between metabolic alteration and PCOS.  Insulin resistance can disrupt the HPO axis, exert a direct effect on ovarian follicle development, induce elevated androgen levels, and, finally, result in ovulation dysfunction. 14 The main biochemical characteristics of PCOS are elevated LH and hyperinsulinemia, which independently affect hyperandrogenism and ovarian follicle development.  PCOS is associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including GDM, PROM, and hypertensive disorders than non-PCOS. 44 , 45 , 46 There is still a lack of evidence on the relationship between the onset time of menstrual disturbance and IVF and ICSI pregnancy outcomes. There are studies on the effect of menstrual patterns on pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS. 47 A prospective cohort study revealed that the presence of hyperandrogenism\u202f+\u202fmenstrual dysfunction\u202f+\u202fpolycystic ovary was associated with increased risks of GDM, preeclampsia, and low birthweight neonates compared with other phenotypes. 48 , 49 Patients with PCOS with amenorrhea experienced a significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than patients with PCOS with normal menstruation. 50 Another study has demonstrated that variation in the length of menstrual cycles may serve as a risk indicator for GDM or impaired glucose tolerance. 51 However, a retrospective cohort study demonstrated that patients with PCOS with different menstrual patterns had similar clinical pregnancy and live birth rates after IVF treatment. We did not find a significant correlation between the onset time of menstrual disturbance and pregnancy outcomes after IVF or ICSI and the initial embryo transfer in this study. Of note, 1 possible reason is that IVF as an effective measure to treat infertility may overcome the adverse effect of HPO axis dysregulation and certain metabolic alterations on reproduction. Alternatively, although 1500 patients with PCOS were included, the sample size may still be underpowered to detect the small difference in pregnancy outcomes, especially for obstetrical complications.    Research implications  Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of our findings beyond Chinese patients with PCOS. In addition, this trial was constrained by its reliance on hCG as the exclusive trigger drug, which increased the risk of OHSS to some extent. The routine transfer of 2 cleavage-stage blastocysts is associated with higher rates of multiple pregnancies and preterm birth.    Strengths and limitations  There are strengths in this study. First, the data were prospectively collected during a multicenter randomized trial with a standard case report form, which ensured the accuracy and completeness of the data. The patients were enrolled from 14 study centers in the original trial, which increased the generalizability of the study. Second, besides the clinical features of PCOS, we also evaluated the pregnancy outcomes after IVF and the first embryo transfer cycle, which provided further information for clinicians. However, there are also limitations in this study. First, as a secondary analysis of the previous trial, the study population was restricted by the inclusion criteria of the original trial. Only women aged 20 to 35 years were included in the original trial and the current study. Thus, the findings may not be extrapolated to older patients with PCOS. Second, as this was a cohort study, we could not rule out the effect of potential confounders during IVF treatment on pregnancy outcomes. Third, the pregnancy outcomes were from the initial embryo transfer cycle. The results may be different from the cumulative pregnancy outcomes after all embryos were transferred or varied with the pregnancy outcomes of ovulation induction and timed intercourse. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.    Conclusion  The findings of the current study suggest that patients with an early onset of menstrual disturbance seemed to have more severe reproductive features but milder metabolic features than those with a late onset of menstrual disturbance in reproductive-age participants with PCOS, whereas the obstetrical and neonatal complications after IVF and the initial cycle of embryo transfer were comparable between the 2 groups.
