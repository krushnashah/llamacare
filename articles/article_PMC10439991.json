    "body": "Introduction  Women of reproductive age may be affected by the\ncomplex, heterogeneous endocrine disorder known as\npolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 1 ). The primary\nfeatures of this condition encompass chronic anovula-tion, menstrual problems, and clinical or biochemical\nsigns of hyperandrogenism ( 2 ). The Rotterdam criterion defines PCOS patients as those female patients with\nthe presence of at least two of the following: polycystic\novaries, oligomenorrhea, and/or anovulation, hyperan-drogenism (clinical and/or biochemical). According to\nthe PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, the prevalence\nrate of PCOS has dispersed globally, ranging from 9.13\nto 36% in India ( 3 ).  Periodontitis on the other hand is considered as a condition distinguished by inflammation of the supporting tissues of the teeth. The strong interplay between putative\nperiodontal pathogens and host inflammatory response is\nattributed to the subsequent destruction of supporting tissue and tooth loss. The endocrine system has a significant\nimpact on the homeostasis of the periodontium which is\nmaintained through complex multifactorial relationships.\nThe estrogen receptor (ER) and a progesterone receptor\n(PgR), present in the periodontium indicate that the periodontium is one of the target tissues for these hormones\n( 4 ). The direct effects of estrogens were mediated through\ntwo distinct subtypes of receptors, ER\u03b1 and Er\u03b2 ( 5 ). The\nER\u03b1 receptor is predominantly present in the different tissues such as the endometrium, ovaries, and mammary\nglands, whereas the ER\u03b2 receptor is present in the non-reproductive tissues, including periodontal ligament ( 6 ),\ngingival epithelium ( 7 ), and salivary glands ( 8 ). This\nexplains the reason that changes in the amounts of circulating steroid hormones can affect periodontal tissues.\nChanges that take place in the level of sex hormones during different stages of females are observed to directly\nor indirectly affect oral health, subsequently influencing\na person's susceptibility to periodontal disease. PCOS is\ndefined by alteration in the level of sex hormone, where\nthe progesterone levels remain low and the levels of estrogen and male androgenic hormones go high. The association of PCOS with an increase in the levels of inflam-matory markers like C reactive protein, pro-inflammatory\ncytokines like interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\n(TNF-\u03b1), and chemokines, demonstrate this low-grade\nsystemic inflammation ( 9 ).  On the other hand, periodontal diseases, like gingivitis\nand periodontitis, are common prevalent chronic infectious diseases. Such diseases are predominantly brought\nin by a bacterial plaque that grows in the subgingival area\nand are also found to increase systemic and local inflam-matory markers such as TNF-\u03b1, C reactive protein, and\ninterluekin-6 (IL-6) which is attributed to the destruction of periodontal tissue ( 10 ). Insulin resistance which\nis a prominent characteristic of PCOS is linked to low-grade inflammation through inflammatory cytokines like\nTNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 and their signaling pathways ( 11 ).\nOn the contrary, hormonal level alterations in PCOS are\nfound to affect the salivary levels of potential periodontal pathogens and/or their systemic immune responses in\nthe presence of gingival inflammation. This might be accounted to the deposition of active progesterone and oestrogen hormones, in the periodontal tissues\u2019 which supply\nthe vital nutrients needed for the growth of the bacteria.\nSince insulin resistance is one of the main symptoms of\nthe PCOS, periodontal organisms in subgingival plaque\nproduce lipopolysaccharides that can cause considerable\nproduction of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1. The insulin resistance can\nget exacerbated upon persistent elevation of cytokines\nwhich can ultimately in turn increase the condition of\nPCOS ( 12 ). Meanwhile, few studies showed an elevated\noxidative stress level and alterations in the oral microbial flora of PCOS patients ( 12 , 13 ). Evaluating the link\nbetween periodontal disease and PCOS, poor periodontal parameters were seen in patients with PCOS. While\nstudies reported higher severity of periodontal disease in\nPCOS patients, hence it is mandatory to undergo peri-odontal examination and therapy periodically ( 14 ).  Hormonal disorders such as PCOS and oral health was\nshown to share a reciprocal link with each other. PCOS\nwas found to bring about a repercussion in periodontal\nhealth by influencing the composition of the oral microflora. But there exists a paucity of literature evaluating\nchange brought in by hormonal disorders, such as PCOS\non the diversity of oral microbiota. The correlation between oral microbiota in dental plaque with the gingival inflammation in presence of PCOS is not been established\nto date. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the role of\nPCOS as a risk factor in causing periodontal disease.    Materials and Methods   Ethical guidelines  The present case-control study protocol was conducted\nin full accordance and approval of the Institutional Ethics\nCommittee, SRIHER with the protocol number CSP/20/\nJAN/83/51. The nature of the study was discussed with\npatients orally and written informed consent was acquired\nfrom each patient prior to the initiation of the study.    Study population and study design  This case-control study was performed between December 2019 to March 2020 and included patients attending the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics\nand Department of Periodontology, Sri Ramachandra\nInstitute of higher education and research. Forty female\npatients between the age of 18 to 40 years were recruited\nfor the study. During screening, patients who fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria were provided with an informed consent form and were recruited into the study. The inclusion\ncriteria for the PCOS group was based on the criteria by\nRotterdam ( 2 ). The control group was healthy female individuals without PCOS and periodontitis. Patients in the\nperiodontitis group were classified according to the definition of Eke et al. ( 15 ). Patients in the gingivitis group\nwere classified according to the American Academy of\nPeriodontology 1998. Patients with other medical conditions and those who had been under medications that\ncould affect their periodontal status for the last 6 months\nwere excluded from the study.  Using a one-way ANOVA test with a power of 0.95,\nalpha of 0.05 with an effect size of 19.25, a sample of\n40 patients including the dropouts (10 members in each\ngroup) was calculated. Four groups were included in the\nstudy which include healthy female individuals, patients\nwith PCOS, patients with PCOS and gingivitis and patients with PCOS and periodontitis  Each patient\u2019s clinical periodontal evaluation, such as\nprobing depth (PD), plaque index (PI), and bleeding on\nprobing, was recorded after enrolment. Apart from third\nmolars, with the help of Williams periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL) six sites of each tooth (mesiobuc-cal, mid-buccal, distobuccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual,\nand disto-lingual locations) were measured clinically. If\nbleeding on probing (BOP) happened within 15 seconds\nof applying the probe, it was considered positive. A single\ncalibrated examiner conducted after the clinical periodon-tal measures. Subsequently, the periodontal inflammatory\nsurface area for each patient was calculated.    Subgingival dental plaque sample collection  The tooth with the deepest PD was dried and isolated using cotton rolls. The subgingival plaque was collected by inserting a sterile Gracey 5/6 curette 2 mm (Hue Friedy,\nSwitzerland) into the gingival pocket followed by a pull\nstroke three subsequent times without evoking bleeding.\nThe strokes had to sufficient force to remove plaque while\nno attempt was made to remove cementum from the root\nsurface.  The Gracey 5/6 curette (Hue Friedy, Switzerland) was\nchosen to standardize as it permits the most effective\nmethod of placing the curette inside the transport tube.\nImmediately upon collection of the samples, the curettes\nwere shaken into a transport tube with 200 \u03bcl of transport solution (Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer\nsolution) (Himedia, Mumbai, India). The samples were\nthen sealed and sent immediately to the testing facility for\nquantification of the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis\nand F. nucleatum.    Sample processing  Following the transfer of the sample to the tube consisting of Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer\n(T.E.buffer) containing tris base powder and Ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid (Himedia, Mumbai, India). It was\ncentrifuged (Model SLM-MCF-10K, Biobee tech, Bengaluru, India) at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room tem-perature. After discarding the supernatant, 500 \u00b5l of fresh\nT.E. buffer was added again and 3 minutes of centrifugation at 5000 rpm was done. The same procedure was sub-sequently repeated 3 times with new T.E. buffer.    DNA extraction procedure  The sample processing was followed by DNA extraction by using modified proteinase-k method ( 16 ). After\ndiscarding the supernatant, 50 \u00b5l of lysis buffer I containing 1% Triton X-100, Tris-HCL pH=8.0, 10 mM, and\nEDTA 1 mM (Himedia, Mumbai, India) was added, vortexed, and allowed to stand for 5 minutes. Then, 10 \u00b5l\nof proteinase-K (100 \u00b5g/ml, Genei laboratories pvt. ltd,\nBengaluru, India) and 50 microliters of Lysis buffer II\ncontain Tris-HCl, pH=8.0, 50 mM, KCl, 50 mM, MgCl2\n,\n2.5 mM, Tween-20, 0.45%, and Nonidet P-40, 0.45% (Hi-media, Mumbai, India) were added, and the mixture was\nvigorously vortexed. The samples are then held in a 60\u00b0C\nfor two hours and then transferred to a boiling water bath\nfor 10 minutes. Following this, the samples were centri-fuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes, and the DNA-containing supernatant is then collected in a new tube. The DNA\nwas purified by using 3 M sodium acetate and absolute\nethanol and reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l water. For PCR analy-sis, the DNA was kept at -200\u00b0C    Bacterial quantification by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  The qPCR reactions were used to determine the presence and levels of two different oral taxa in the sub-gingival plaque samples. Using an Eppendorf Real\nplex master cycler, real-time qPCR amplification and\ndetection reactions were carried out in a 96-well format. Also, an 8 pm/\u03bcl of each P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum-specific primers were used in a total volume\nof 25 \u03bcl for the PCR reactions, along with 2 \u03bcl of template DNA and 12.5 \u03bcl of TB Green Premix Ex Taq\n(Tli RNaseH Plus) (Takara Bio inc., Kusatsu, Japan).\nAll species-specific primers used in the qPCR reaction\nare given in Table 1 ( 17 , 18 ). The reaction mixture was\nprepared in 0.2 ml qPCR tubes and kept in a thermal\ncycler (Realplex Master cycler, Eppendorf, Hamburg,\nGermany). qPCR reaction conditions were 95\u00b0C for\n3 minutes, and 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 seconds and\n60\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. Plotting the standard graph required running serial dilutions of DNA isolated (same procedure as described\nabove) from the standard strains of P. gingivalis ATCC\nNo. 33277 (Known quantity, (108\nto 103\nCFU/ml) and\nF. nucleatum ATCC No. 25886 (Known quantity, 108\nto 103 CFU/ml). Deionised water served as a negative\ncontrol. The amplification curves were obtained with\nfluorescent probes. Cycle threshold values (CT value)\nwere obtained for DNA samples of known quantity\n(standards) and standard curve was plotted. Ct values of unknown samples were obtained from real time\nPCR runs. Then these CT values were plotted on the\nstandard curve to get the corresponding quantity for\nunknown samples.    Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version\n3.1.9.2 statistical software (International Business Machines Cooperation, Chicago). The data distribution\nwas assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. After\ndividing the entire data below and above the median,\nKruskal-Walli\u2019s test was used to compare all groups\nfor non-normally distributed data (bacterial counts).\nFor normally distributed variables (Periodontal Epithelial Surface Area & Periodontal Inflammatory Surface\nArea), the ordinary one-way ANOVA test was used.\nStatistical significance was set at P\u22640.05 with a 95%\nlevel of confidence in the statistical analyses, which\nwere carried out using the statistical program (SPSS\nversion 3.1.9.2; International Business Machines Cooperation, Chicago).     Results   Demographic data  Full-mouth clinical assessments and demographic data\nwere documented ( Table 2 ). For all four groups, bleeding\nin probing (BOP), periodontal pocket depth (PPD),\nand clinical attachment loss (CAL) were determined. It\nwas observed that the BOP, PPD, and CAL levels were\nsignificantly higher in the PCOS with periodontitis group.    Primary analysis results    Bacterial count analysis in plaque samples  The microbiological diversity of the dental plaque\nwas assessed using qPCR. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteria were quantified.\nAlthough there was a difference in the level of Porphyromonas gingivalis among the four groups, the\nresults were not statistically significant. Quantification\nof the level of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed an\nascending growth pattern of the healthy group to group\nwith PCOS and periodontitis ( Table 2 ). On intergroup\ncomparison in the levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a\nstatistically significant difference was obtained between\nthe healthy female individuals and patients with PCOS\nand periodontitis (P=0.04, Fig .1 ).   Fig.1   Subgingival Fusobacterium nucleatum levels. PCOS; Polycystic ovary\nsyndrome.       Secondary results analysis  The periodontal epithelial surface area (PESA)\naccurately measures the surface area of the pocket epithelium, whereas periodontal inflammatory surface\narea (PISA) measures the amount of the inflamed\nperiodontal tissue and as such assess the systemic\ninflammatory burden. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet\nwas developed to help with the estimation of Periodontal\nInflammatory Surface Area and Periodontal Epithelial\nSurface Area using the formulas published by Hujoel et al.\n( 20 ). PESA and PISA values were found to be statistically\nsignificant among the four groups (P=0.00). Among the\nintergroup comparison of periodontal inflammatory\nsurface area scores, a significant difference was noted\nbetween healthy female individuals and patients with\nPCOS patients with gingivitis and periodontitis (P=0.00, Fig .2 , Table 3 ).

Discussion  The PCOS is an endocrine condition caused by a\ndisruption in the hypothalamus pituitary axis, which results\nin abnormal gonadotropin secretion by the hypothalamus.\nThis abnormal secretion of the gonadotropin hormone\nleads to an increased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and\nnormal or low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels\n( 20 ). Bacterial plaque that causes periodontal diseases\nresults in local and systemic elevations in levels of TNF-\u03b1,\nC reactive protein, and IL-6. These factors subsequently\nresult in the destruction of periodontal tissue. Both,\nPCOS and periodontal disease, share chronic low-grade\ninflammation as a common risk factor. The existing\nstudies reported that in comparison to healthy controls,\npatients with PCOS suffered from greater rates of BOP,\nperiodontal probing depth (PPD), and CAL ( 21 , 22 ).  Studies have also shown that periodontal disease may\ncause systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, both of\nwhich can aggravate insulin resistance. This suggests that\nthere may be a bidirectional association between PCOS\nand PD ( 23 ). On the other hand, female sex hormones\nare found to affect the composition of oral microbiota\nin conditions like puberty, mensuration, and pregnancy.\nAlso, studies confirm the increase in the levels of\nPrevotella intermedia in the subgingival plaque due to an\nincreased plasma female sex hormones and alteration of\nthe immune response ( 24 , 25 ). There are limited data on\nPCOS effects on putative periodontal pathogens, which\nformed the principle objective of the current study.  Our findings suggest that PCOS has an amplifying\neffect on the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum and their connection with\ngingival inflammation. Thus, the change in the microbiota\nin patients with PCOS could play a pivotal role in the\npropagation of gingival inflammation. Akcali et al. ( 12 )\nobserved an increase in the salivary levels of Fusobacterium\nnucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis in PCOS patients\nwhen compared to healthy controls. Active progesterone\nand oestrogen was found to supply crucial nutrients needed\nfor bacterial growth. In light of the accumulation of these\nhormones in periodontal tissues, the author concluded that\nhormonal alterations in PCOS may influence the salivary\nlevels of putative periodontal pathogens and/or their systemic antibody responses. This is especially true in the\npresence of gingival inflammation ( 26 ).  Our results were in agreement with the study conducted\nby Porwal et al. ( 27 ) that observed an increase in the BOP\nin the newly diagnosed PCOS group when compared to\nthe healthy group. These results indicate the impact of\nPCOS on the gingival inflammation.  Young female individuals between 18 to 35 years of\nage are generally not prone to periodontitis ( 28 ), but\nthe results of our present study showed a comparatively\nhigh level of putative periodontal pathogens in PCOS\npatients which subsequently may lead to an increase in\nthe inflammatory burden. This points us the fact that\nthe presence of PCOS in young female individuals can\npredispose them to periodontal diseases. Hence, PCOS\ncan be considered a viable risk factor in the initiation and\nprogression of periodontal diseases in the young healthy\nfemale individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first study\nto assess the levels of suspected periodontal pathogens\nin dental plaque samples from non-obese women with\nPCOS. The limitations of the present study include a\nsmall sample size and site-specific based assessment\nof oral microbiota. Insulin resistance of patients wasn\u2019t\nconsidered in the present study and thereby could be a\nconfounding factor. Future longitudinal studies with\nlarger sample size, are needed to evaluate the influence\nof PCOS on the subgingival microbial environment and\nalso, to investigate probable relationships between PCOS\nand periodontal disease.    Conclusion  The persistent polymicrobial challenge to the local\nhost tissues often results in the progressive destruction of\nsoft and hard tissues which is considered as the hallmark\nof periodontitis. Pathogenic consortium which causes\nthese responses include the red complex bacteria such as P. gingivalis, T. denticola and T. forsythia. Additionally,\nhigher concentration of possible periodontopathogens\nsuch as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella species,\nEikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus is found in deeper periodontal\npockets. Oral health is often subjected to direct and\nindirect effects of the fluctuating levels of sex hormones\nduring conditions like PCOS which can influence the constituents of the oral microflora causing reverberation\nin periodontal health. Amongst the studied taxa in the\npresent study, higher levels of Fusobacterium. nucelatum and Porphyromonas. gingivalis were observed in the\nsubgingival plaque samples in patients with PCOS and\nperiodontitis and patients with PCOS and gingivitis\nwhen compared to healthy individuals. Therefore, within\nthe limitations of the study, it can be concluded that\nPCOS may quantitatively affect the constituents of oral\nmicroflora playing a pivotal role in subsequent gingival\ninflammation and periodontal health.",
