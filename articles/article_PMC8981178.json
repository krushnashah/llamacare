    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Progesterone is the primary regulator of cyclic gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency reduction in adult women (Soules et al., 1984 ), and a reduction in GnRH pulse frequency during the luteal phase appears to be important for normal long\u2010term cyclic function (Lam & Ferin, 1987 ; Soules et al., 1987 ). However, it remains unknown how rapidly progesterone suppresses GnRH pulse frequency in women. In cows and sheep, a rapid (within 2\u20136\u00a0h) decrease in GnRH pulse frequency was observed with progesterone administration (Bergfeld et al., 1996 ; Skinner et al., 1998 ). While two studies in women suggested that LH pulse frequency can be suppressed within 8\u201314\u00a0h of progesterone administration (Minakami et al., 1984 ; Permezel et al., 1989 ), two others suggested that progesterone administration does not suppress LH pulse frequency within 12\u00a0h (Hutchens et al., 2016 ; McCartney et al., 2007 ). In addition, the GnRH pulse generator is relatively resistant to progesterone negative feedback in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Daniels & Berga, 1997 ; Pastor et al., 1998 ), and the time course of progesterone\u2010related LH pulse frequency lowering in PCOS is similarly unclear.  In addition to the negative feedback effects of progesterone on LH pulse frequency, progesterone can acutely augment gonadotropin release. Prior studies disclosed a rapid (within 4\u00a0h) and marked augmentation of LH and FSH secretion after oral progesterone administration in normally cycling women pretreated with estradiol (Hutchens et al., 2016 ; McCartney et al., 2007 ), similar to previous reports (Chang & Jaffe, 1978 ; Nippoldt et al., 1987 ). Although the positive feedback phenomenon accounting for the midcycle gonadotropin surge primarily reflects estradiol positive feedback, a pre\u2010ovulatory increase in circulating progesterone may augment estradiol positive feedback at midcycle (Chang & Jaffe, 1978 ; Liu & Yen, 1983 ). Indeed, some studies suggest that progesterone positive feedback is important for normal surge characteristics, including the FSH surge (Chang & Jaffe, 1978 ; Liu & Yen, 1983 ; March et al., 1979 ; Taylor et al., 1995 ). Although women with PCOS demonstrate impaired progesterone negative feedback on LH pulse frequency, it remains unclear whether such women may also demonstrate impaired progesterone positive feedback.  The purpose of this study was to test the primary hypothesis that exogenous progesterone, given in the early morning, acutely (within 12\u00a0h) suppresses waking LH pulse frequency in estradiol\u2010pretreated normally cycling women, but to a lesser degree in estradiol\u2010pretreated women with PCOS (i.e., that acute progesterone negative feedback on waking LH pulse frequency is impaired in PCOS). An a priori secondary hypothesis was that exogenous progesterone acutely increases LH and FSH concentrations more so in normally cycling women compared to women with PCOS (i.e., that acute progesterone positive feedback on gonadotropin release is impaired in PCOS). Some data from this study was previously reported: in 12 normally cycling women (the control group), progesterone administration did not acutely reduce waking LH pulse frequency, although progesterone acutely and markedly increased LH and FSH concentrations (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). Herein findings in the PCOS group are reported, in addition to comparisons between PCOS and controls.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  All study procedures, which were in accordance with the ethical standards of Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008, were approved by the Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research at the University of Virginia (UVA). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00594217).   2.1  Subjects  Twelve normally cycling controls and 12 women with PCOS completed the study. The study was initiated in both groups contemporaneously. However, subject accruement was achieved more rapidly for normally cycling controls. All 12 controls completed study from 2009 to 2012. Seven women with PCOS completed study from 2010 to 2013, and five completed study between 2014 and 2020. Findings in normally cycling controls were previously reported (Hutchens et al., 2016 ).  As previously described, controls had regular menstrual cycles and were without evidence of hyperandrogenism. Subjects were considered to have PCOS if they had evidence of clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism plus oligo\u2010/amenorrhea in the absence of other identifiable causes. Subjects had not taken any medications known to affect the reproductive axis for 90\u00a0days prior to and during the study. A detailed description of inclusion and exclusion criteria used for the study are available in supplemental materials. Baseline characteristics of all participants are summarized in Table 1 .

All participants had normal screening tests except for abnormalities that were expected in the PCOS group (e.g., hyperandrogenemia).  This was a randomized, double\u2010blinded, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover study. Each subject underwent two frequent sampling studies to characterize LH and FSH secretion (Figure 1 ). Each subject was randomized to receive either progesterone or placebo during her first 24\u2010h admission to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU). During a second 24\u2010h CRU admission, which occurred in a subsequent menstrual cycle, subjects received the intervention (placebo or progesterone) that they did not receive during the first admission. (In all cases, the second admission occurred at least 28\u00a0days after the first admission.) Therefore, when assessing the acute impact of progesterone versus placebo on gonadotropin release, each subject served as her own control.   FIGURE 1   Schematic of study protocol. With regard to the order of progesterone and placebo administration, the solid line illustrates initial randomization to progesterone, while the dotted line illustrates initial randomization to placebo     Beta\u2010hCG and progesterone levels were checked 4\u20135\u00a0days before scheduled CRU admissions to rule out pregnancy and, in women with PCOS, to help ensure the study would not be performed during a luteal phase. Starting 3\u00a0days before each admission, subjects were pretreated with estradiol patches (delivering a total dose of 0.2\u00a0mg/day) placed on the abdomen and changed after 2\u00a0days. Estradiol was administered to standardize hypothalamic progesterone receptors. Normally cycling women started estradiol on cycle days 4\u20138 inclusive; subjects with PCOS started estradiol no earlier than cycle day 4. Subjects continued estradiol throughout each overnight admission.  On day 3 of estradiol administration\u2014cycle days 7\u201311 inclusive in controls\u2014subjects were admitted to CRU at 18:00\u00a0h for a 24\u2010h frequent blood sampling study. Beginning at 20:00\u00a0h, blood was obtained through an indwelling intravenous forearm catheter over a 24\u2010h period as follows: LH every 10\u00a0min; progesterone every 30\u00a0min; FSH, estradiol, and testosterone every 120\u00a0min. At 06:00\u00a0h, after obtaining additional blood for SHBG, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose, either oral micronized progesterone (100\u00a0mg) or placebo suspension was administered. At the completion of blood sampling at 20:00\u00a0h, estradiol patches were removed and subjects were discharged. In a subsequent cycle, subjects underwent another overnight study identical to the first except that oral progesterone was exchanged for placebo or vice versa in keeping with the crossover design.  During each admission, subjects fasted from 22:00 to 06:00\u00a0h; they were otherwise given standard meals at standard times during the admission. In addition, subjects were encouraged to sleep from 22:00 to 06:00\u00a0h, and they were not allowed to sleep before 22:00\u00a0h or after 06:00\u00a0h. Sleep was evaluated via Motionlogger Basic\u2010L wrist actigraphy. At discharge from both admissions, subjects were provided and advised to take oral iron supplementation (325\u00a0mg twice daily for 30\u00a0days) to help replenish iron stores.    2.3  Hormonal measurements  The Ligand Assay and Analysis Core of the Center for Research in Reproduction (CRR) performed all hormonal assays as previously described (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). Detailed assay characteristics were described previously (Kim et al., 2018 ). In brief, LH and FSH were measured by chemiluminescence (sensitivities 0.1 and 0.1\u00a0IU/L; intraassay coefficient of variation [CVs] 3.3 and 3.2%; interassay CVs 5.8 and 4.9%; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Los Angeles, CA). Prior to January 2015, sex steroids were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA; Diagnostic Products, DPC). In 2014, the manufacturer discontinued most steroid RIA kits used by the CRR. Therefore, starting January 2015, the total testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone were measured by other immunoassays. Each replacement method was evaluated according to the Endocrine Society Sex Steroid Assays Reporting Task Force guidelines (Wierman et al., 2014 ). The replacement methods were correlated to DPC RIA, and the RIA\u2010equivalent values were used for analysis and presented here. Importantly, all assay methods were identical between admissions for each study participant.    2.4  Data analysis  To account for unequal LH measurement error across the physiologic range of LH concentrations observed during study admissions, a computerized data reduction protocol ( StdCurve ) was used to generate a variance model for LH measurement error for each admission, as described previously (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). Pulsatile LH secretion was then assessed for each 10\u2010h time block of interest (see below) using AutoDecon , an automated (non\u2010subjective) multiparameter deconvolution program, as described previously (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). AutoDecon has 96% sensitivity to detect LH pulses with a low (6%) false positive rate (Johnson et al., 2008 ). In addition to determining the temporal location of each significant LH pulse, AutoDecon provides estimates for mean LH pulse mass, area under the LH concentration curve (AUC), basal (non\u2010pulsatile) LH secretion, and LH half\u2010life in the circulation. LH pulse mass\u2014a correlate of LH pulse amplitude\u2014is an estimate of the amount of LH secreted by the pituitary during each pulse.  The primary outcome variable was LH pulse frequency. Using AutoDecon \u2010identified LH pulse locations, average interpulse interval (IPI) was defined for specified time blocks, as previously described (McCartney et al., 2007 ). LH pulse frequency (pulses/hour) over the specified time block was calculated as 60 divided by average IPI. Secondary outcome variables included mean LH, mean FSH, LH AUC, FSH AUC, mean LH pulse mass, pulsatile LH secretion, basal LH secretion, and LH half\u2010life. Pulsatile LH secretion was calculated for each time block as average LH pulse mass multiplied by the number of LH pulses. Notably, predefined pulse exclusion criteria (as previously described (Hutchens et al., 2016 )) were not applied given that doing so would lead to analytical errors with regard to AutoDecon \u2010derived LH AUC and mean LH pulse mass. The AUC of FSH concentration during each time block was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.  The primary a priori hypotheses were as follows: in normally cycling women, the pre\u2010 to post\u2010progesterone reduction in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency (20:00\u201306:00 vs. 10:00\u201320:00\u00a0h) would be greater than the pre\u2010 to post\u2010placebo reduction in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency, and the progesterone\u2010related reduction in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency (a negative feedback effect) would be less prominent in women with PCOS compared to normally cycling controls. A priori secondary hypotheses were that progesterone\u2010related increases in LH and FSH release (positive feedback effects) would be less prominent in women with PCOS compared to normally cycling controls.    2.5  Statistical analysis  Based on previously obtained data regarding within\u2010subject variability in LH pulse frequency differences between progesterone and placebo treatments (McCartney et al., 2007 ), it was determined that 12 normally cycling women without hyperandrogenism would need to complete the current study to detect a 1.0\u00a0mean change in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency (16.7\u2010min mean change in 10\u2010hour LH interpulse interval) between the progesterone and placebo conditions, assuming 80% statistical power and 0.05 type I error rate. Based on the assumption that the PCOS group would not demonstrate a short\u2010term progesterone\u2010related change in LH pulse frequency, and that within\u2010subject variability in PCOS group would be similar to that in controls, we reasoned that 12\u00a0subjects in the PCOS group would provide a minimum detectable absolute progesterone\u2010related interpulse interval change of 16.7\u00a0min between the PCOS and control groups with at least 80% statistical power. Sixteen normally cycling women and 13 women with PCOS initiated formal study procedures. However, for personal reasons, 3 women in the control group and one woman in the PCOS group dropped out of the study after completing only one admission. In addition, data from one woman in the control group was excluded from analysis because her average progesterone level before progesterone administration was 4.8\u00a0ng/mL (15.3\u00a0nmol/L), indicating that the frequent\u2010sampling study was unintentionally performed during the luteal phase. Thus, data for 12 women in each study group were formally analyzed.  Statistical analyses were conducted using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 crossover design ANOVA paradigm to compare the baseline (pre\u2010intervention) outcome measure (e.g., pre\u2010intervention LH pulse frequency) between the placebo and progesterone admissions for each study group, and to compare the within\u2010group (PCOS or non\u2010PCOS) pre\u2010 to post\u2010intervention changes in the outcome measure between the placebo and progesterone admissions (e.g., pre\u2010 to post\u2010progesterone change in LH pulse frequency vs. the pre\u2010 to post\u2010placebo change in LH pulse frequency). A 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 crossover design ANOVA paradigm was also used to compare progesterone\u2010attributable changes (i.e., pre\u2010 to post\u2010progesterone changes vs. pre\u2010 to post\u2010placebo changes) in the outcome measure between the PCOS and control groups.  All outcome measures were analyzed on a natural logarithmic scale to satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA (parametric) testing, and all hypothesis testing was directed at comparing the geometric mean of the measurement distribution. The geometric mean (GM) is a central location parameter of the measurement distribution; it is analogous to arithmetic mean of the measurement distribution, but is less sensitive than the arithmetic mean to be influenced by positively skewed data when the outcome measure is restricted to positive values.  With regard to hypothesis testing for the pre\u2010intervention outcome measure comparisons, an F \u2010test was used to test the null hypothesis that the GM of the measurement distribution is the same for the placebo and progesterone admissions. For the within\u2010group comparisons (PCOS or non\u2010PCOS) of the pre\u2010 to post\u2010intervention (placebo or progesterone) change in outcome measure, an F \u2010test was used to test the null hypothesis that the ratio of GMs (i.e., either post\u2010placebo GM:pre\u2010placebo GM or post\u2010progesterone GM:pre\u2010progesterone GM) is equal to 1. For the within\u2010group (PCOS or non\u2010PCOS) between\u2010admission comparisons (placebo vs. progesterone), an F \u2010test was used to test the null hypothesis that the ratio of GMs (i.e. post\u2010intervention GM:pre\u2010intervention GM) is the same irrespective of the intervention. Finally, for the between\u2010group (PCOS vs. non\u2010PCOS) between\u2010admission comparisons (i.e., placebo vs. progesterone admissions), an F \u2010test was used to test the null hypothesis that the between\u2010admission ratio of intra\u2010admission GM ratios (i.e. post\u2010intervention:pre\u2010intervention) is the same irrespective of the study group (PCOS vs. non\u2010PCOS). Due to the multiple hypothesis testing strategy, all of the aforementioned within\u2010group and between\u2010group hypothesis tests were analytically assessed for statistical significance based on a multiple comparison Bonferroni\u2010corrected p \u2264\u00a00.05 criterion.  As sensitivity analyses, two additional sets of post hoc analyses were performed. First, given that group differences in achieved progesterone and estradiol concentrations could have represented confounders in the primary (a priori) analyses, the above analyses were repeated using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 crossover ANCOVA paradigm to adjust for differences in achieved progesterone and estradiol levels. Second, one normally cycling subject had a marked discordance of mean LH and LH pulse amplitude responses to progesterone/placebo compared to the other participants, as previously reported (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). To address the possibility that samples for her progesterone and placebo admissions had been mislabeled, all of the aforementioned analyses were repeated after excluding this subject.  Unless otherwise specified, uncorrected p values are reported herein. Both uncorrected and Bonferroni\u2010corrected p values are routinely reported whenever they fall on different sides of the 0.05 threshold. More detailed results of statistical analyses are available in supplemental materials.     3  RESULTS  The progesterone admission occurred first in 2 of 12 controls and in 8 of 12 women with PCOS. The progesterone admission occurred on cycle day 10 (9\u201311) (median [interquartile range, IQR]) for normally cycling controls, and cycle day 45.0 (12.5\u201361.0) for women with PCOS. The placebo admissions occurred on cycle days 10.0 (9.0\u201311.0) and 30.0 (12.8\u201359.3) for the control and PCOS groups, respectively. As assessed with wrist actigraphy, respective sleep durations (median [IQR]) for progesterone and placebo admissions were as follows: 7.8 (7.4\u20137.9)\u00a0h and 7.2 (6.6\u20137.7)\u00a0h in controls; 7.8 (7.1\u20137.8)\u00a0h and 7.7 (7.3\u20137.8)\u00a0h for PCOS. Respective sleep efficiencies for progesterone and placebo admissions were as follows: 93 (90\u201394) and 97 (94\u201399) percent in controls; 89 (87\u201399) and 92 (87\u201395) percent in PCOS.   3.1  Sex steroids  Progesterone, estradiol, and total testosterone concentrations during the admissions are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective hormone time series are presented graphically in Figure 2 . Pre\u2010intervention 10\u2010h (20:00\u201306:00\u00a0h) progesterone concentrations were similar between placebo and progesterone admissions for both normal controls and PCOS ( p >\u00a00.5 for both groups). Ten\u2010hour progesterone concentrations increased markedly with progesterone administration in both groups (8.4\u2010fold increase in GM [95% CI, 6.7\u201310.5] in controls; 5.2\u2010fold increase in GM [95% CI, 4.2\u20136.5] in PCOS; p <\u00a00.001 for both groups). Ten\u2010hour progesterone concentrations increased slightly with placebo, although such changes were not statistically significant in the control group (25% increase in GM [95% CI, 0\u201356%]; p =\u00a00.052) or in the PCOS group (23% increase in GM [95% CI, \u22122\u201353%]; p =\u00a00.074). As expected, the change in 10\u2010h progesterone concentrations associated with progesterone administration exceeded the change associated with placebo administration in both groups (6.7\u2010fold higher in controls; 4.2\u2010fold higher in PCOS; p < 0.001 for both; Figure 2B ). Notably, the change in 10\u2010hour progesterone concentrations attributable to progesterone administration appeared to be less pronounced in PCOS compared to controls (ratio of ratios 0.63 [95% CI, 0.42\u20130.95]; p = 0.030), although this was not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction ( p =\u00a00.060).

For each group, between\u2010admission comparisons of pre\u2010 versus post\u2010intervention changes (i.e., pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010placebo change vs. pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010progesterone change)\u2014reflecting changes attributable to progesterone administration\u2014are expressed as a ratio of GM ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Accompanying p values are for the null hypothesis test that the GM ratio is the same for the PBO and P4 admissions. Finally, between\u2010group comparisons of such GM ratios\u2014reflecting changes attributable to progesterone administration in the control group vs. changes attributable to progesterone administration in the PCOS group\u2014are expressed as a ratio of GM ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. For this between\u2010group comparison, the unadjusted p <\u00a00.05 but the Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p value (in brackets) was >0.05. To convert metric units to SI units: progesterone\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.18 (nmol/L); estradiol\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.67 (pmol/L); testosterone\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.0347 (nmol/L)     In both groups, mean estradiol and total testosterone levels (Figure 2 ) were similar between the progesterone and placebo admissions. Achieved estradiol levels were not significantly different between controls and PCOS ( p =\u00a00.065 and 0.192 for the placebo and progesterone admissions, respectively). As expected, total testosterone was higher in the PCOS groups ( p <\u00a00.001).    3.2  LH pulse frequency  Simple summary statistics for LH pulse frequency are shown in Table 3 (more detail is provided in supplemental materials), and intervention\u2010related changes are graphically represented in Figure 3 . Pre\u2010intervention LH pulse frequency was similar between placebo and progesterone admissions ( p >\u00a00.3) in both groups. In controls, 10\u2010h GM LH pulse frequency increased by 26% (95% CI, 4\u201352%; p =\u00a00.017) and 12% (95% CI, \u22127\u201335%; p =\u00a00.221) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with no significant difference between placebo and progesterone (ratio of GM ratios 0.89 [95% CI 0.71\u20131.12]; p =\u00a00.314). In women with PCOS, 10\u2010h GM LH pulse frequency increased by 14% (95% CI, \u22126\u201337%; p =\u00a00.168) and 8% (95% CI \u221210\u201331%; p =\u00a00.383) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with no significant difference between placebo and progesterone (ratio of GM ratios 0.95 [95% CI 0.76\u20131.20]; p =\u00a00.672). The changes in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency attributable to progesterone were similar between the control and PCOS groups (ratio of ratios 1.07 [95% CI, 0.77\u20131.49]; p =\u00a00.674). Overall, these results suggest that exogenous progesterone does not acutely reduce LH pulse frequency in normally cycling controls or in women with PCOS.

Unadjusted p values (and Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p values in brackets) are for the null hypothesis test that changes accompanying PBO administration are the same as changes accompanying P4 administration. Between\u2010group comparisons of such GM ratios (i.e., changes attributable to progesterone administration in the control group vs. changes attributable to progesterone administration in the PCOS group) are also expressed as a ratio of GM ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Unadjusted p values (and Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p values in brackets) are for the null hypothesis test that changes attributable to progesterone in the control group are the same as changes attributable to progesterone in the PCOS group       3.3  Mean LH and LH AUC  Pre\u2010intervention mean LH was similar between placebo and progesterone admissions in both groups ( p >\u00a00.4 for both) (Table 3 ; Figures 3 and 4 ). In controls, 10\u2010h GM mean LH increased 1.61\u2010fold (95% CI, 1.23\u20132.11; p =\u00a00.001) and 3.07\u2010fold (95% CI, 2.34\u20134.02; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with a significantly greater increase with progesterone administration (ratio of GM ratios 1.90 [95% CI, 1.25\u20132.90]; p =\u00a00.004). In women with PCOS, 10\u2010h GM mean LH increased by 1.37\u2010fold (95% CI, 1.05\u20131.80; p =\u00a00.022) and 2.68\u2010fold (95% CI, 2.05\u20133.51; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with a significantly greater increase with progesterone administration (ratio of ratios 1.95 [95% CI, 1.28\u20132.97]; p =\u00a00.003). The changes attributable to progesterone were similar between the control and PCOS groups ( p =\u00a00.926).   FIGURE 4   LH and FSH time series for normally cycling control (NC) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) groups. Data from the control group (a, LH; c, FSH) are shown as open (placebo [PBO] admission) and closed (progesterone [P4] admission) circles. Data from the PCOS group (b, LH; d, FSH) are shown as open (PBO admission) and closed (P4 admission) squares. Each data point represents the group geometric mean for that time point, with vertical lines indicating 95% confidence intervals. The time points at which either PBO or P4 was administered is indicated by the arrows     LH area under the curve (AUC) results (Table 3 ) were generally similar to those for mean LH. Controls exhibited a significantly greater increase in LH AUC with progesterone versus placebo administration (ratio of GM ratios 2.22 [95% CI, 1.36\u20133.61]; p = 0.003), but women with PCOS did not (ratio of GM ratios 1.41 [95% CI, 0.86\u20132.30]; p =\u00a00.160). However, changes in LH AUC attributable to progesterone were not demonstrably different between the control and PCOS groups ( p =\u00a00.187).  Taken together, these results confirm that progesterone acutely augments mean LH and LH AUC in E2\u2010pretreated women, but they do not substantively support the hypothesis that acute progesterone augmentation of mean LH or LH AUC is impaired in women with PCOS.    3.4  LH pulse mass and pulsatile LH secretion  Pre\u2010intervention LH pulse mass was similar between placebo and progesterone admissions for both groups ( p >\u00a00.4 for both) (Table 3 , Figure 3 ). In controls, 10\u2010h GM LH pulse mass increased by 20% (95% CI, \u221214\u201369%; p =\u00a00.277) and 3.60\u2010fold (95% CI, 2.56\u20135.05; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with a significantly greater increase with progesterone (ratio of GM ratios 2.99 [95% CI 1.73\u20135.17]; p <\u00a00.001). In women with PCOS, 10\u2010h GM LH pulse mass increased by 84% with placebo (95% CI, 31\u2013159%; p =\u00a00.001) and 2.42\u2010fold with progesterone (95% CI, 1.72\u20133.40; p <\u00a00.001), with no significant difference between placebo and progesterone (ratio of GM ratios 1.31 [95% CI, 0.76\u20132.27]; p =\u00a00.312). The changes in 10\u2010h LH pulse mass attributable to progesterone were less prominent in the PCOS group compared to controls (ratio of ratios 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20\u20130.95]; p =\u00a00.038), although this was not significant after Bonferroni correction ( p =\u00a00.076).  Pre\u2010intervention pulsatile LH secretion was similar between placebo and progesterone admissions in controls and in women with PCOS ( p >\u00a00.7 for both) (Table 3 ; Figure 3 ). In controls, 10\u2010h GM LH pulsatile secretion increased 51% (95% CI, 3\u2013122%; p =\u00a00.038) and 4.14\u2010fold (95% CI, 2.82\u20136.09; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with a significantly greater increase with progesterone administration (ratio of GM ratios 2.75 [95% CI, 1.52\u20134.95]; p =\u00a00.002). In women with PCOS, 10\u2010h GM LH pulsatile secretion increased 2.08\u2010fold (95% CI, 1.41\u20133.05; p <\u00a00.001) and 2.62\u2010fold (95% CI, 1.78\u20133.85; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with no significant difference between the two (GM ratio 1.26 [95% CI, 0.70\u20132.27]; p =\u00a00.423). The changes in 10\u2010h pulsatile LH secretion attributable to progesterone appeared to be less pronounced in women with PCOS compared to controls, although this was not statistically significant (ratio of ratios 0.46 [95% CI, 0.20\u20131.06]; p =\u00a00.066).  Overall, these results suggest that progesterone acutely augments LH pulse mass and LH pulsatile secretion in E2\u2010pretreated women. Although not conclusive, these results also suggest the possibility that acute progesterone augmentation of LH pulse mass and pulsatile LH secretion may be impaired in PCOS.    3.5  Basal LH secretion and LH half\u2010life  Pre\u2010intervention LH basal secretion and LH half\u2010life were similar between placebo and progesterone admissions in the control and PCOS groups. Neither basal LH secretion nor LH half\u2010life changed substantially with placebo or progesterone administration; no significant differences in basal LH secretion or LH half\u2010life were observed between the placebo and progesterone conditions in either group (supplemental materials); and no progesterone\u2010related differences were observed between the control and PCOS groups for 10\u2010h basal LH secretion ( p =\u00a00.735) or for 10\u2010h LH half\u2010life ( p =\u00a00.261). Overall, these results suggest that exogenous progesterone does not acutely affect basal LH secretion or LH half\u2010life in normally cycling controls or in women with PCOS.    3.6  Mean FSH and FSH AUC  Simple summary statistics for mean FSH are shown in Table 3 (more detail is provided in supplemental materials), and intervention\u2010related changes are graphically represented in Figures 4 and 5 . Pre\u2010intervention mean FSH was similar between the progesterone and placebo admissions in both groups ( p >\u00a00.2 for both). In controls, 10\u2010h GM mean FSH increased by 31% (95% CI, 12\u201354%; p =\u00a00.001) and 97% (95% CI, 68\u2013131%; p <\u00a00.001) with placebo and progesterone administration, respectively, with a significantly greater increase with progesterone administration (ratio of GM ratios 1.50 [95% CI, 1.20\u20131.88]; p =\u00a00.001). In women with PCOS, 10\u2010h GM mean FSH did not change significantly with placebo (16% increase [95% CI, \u22121\u201337%]; p =\u00a00.063), but FSH increased 52% (95% CI, 29\u201378%; p <\u00a00.001) with progesterone administration. The progesterone\u2010related increase in mean FSH appeared to exceed the placebo\u2010related increase in PCOS (ratio of GM ratios 1.30 [95% CI 1.04\u20131.63]; p =\u00a00.024), although this difference was not significant after Bonferroni correction ( p =\u00a00.072). The changes in 10\u2010h mean FSH attributable to progesterone were similar between control and PCOS groups (ratio of ratios 0.87 [95% CI, 0.63\u20131.19]; p =\u00a00.369).   FIGURE 5   FSH concentrations in normally cycling control (NC) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) groups. (a)\u00a0Individual subject changes for control (left) and PCOS (right) groups. For each group, open circles connected by a thin line indicate individual subject changes (pre\u2010intervention to post\u2010intervention) for placebo (PBO; left) and progesterone (P4; right) admissions. Solid circles connected by a thick line indicate group geometric mean (GM) changes (pre\u2010 to post\u2010intervention). (b) Post\u2010intervention relative to pre\u2010intervention FSH for the PBO and P4 admissions, expressed as GM ratios. Vertical lines identify the 95% confidence interval for the GM ratio; the gray horizontal line identifies the GM ratio of equality (i.e., where GM ratio\u00a0=\u00a01); and asterisks denote statistically significant changes ( p <\u00a00.05, pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010intervention). For each group, between\u2010admission comparisons of pre\u2010 versus post\u2010intervention changes (i.e., the pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010placebo change vs. the pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010progesterone change)\u2014reflecting changes attributable to progesterone administration\u2014are expressed as a ratio of GM ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Unadjusted p values (and Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p values in brackets) are for the null hypothesis test that changes accompanying PBO administration are the same as changes accompanying P4 administration. The between\u2010group comparison of such GM ratios (i.e., the change attributable to progesterone administration in the control group vs. the change attributable to progesterone administration in the PCOS group) is also expressed as a ratio of ratios with the accompanying 95% confidence interval; the unadjusted p value (and the Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p value in brackets) is for the null hypothesis test that changes attributable to progesterone in the control group are the same as changes attributable to progesterone in the PCOS group     FSH AUC results (Table 3 and supplemental materials) were generally similar to those for mean FSH. Controls exhibited a significantly greater increase in FSH AUC with progesterone versus placebo administration (ratio of GM ratios 1.53 [95% CI, 1.21\u20131.93]; p =\u00a00.001), as did women with PCOS (ratio of GM ratios 1.35 [95% CI, 1.07\u20131.71]; p =\u00a00.014). Changes in FSH AUC attributable to progesterone were similar between the control and PCOS groups (ratio of ratios 0.89 [95% CI, 0.64\u20131.24]; p =\u00a00.461).  Taken together, these results suggest that progesterone acutely augments mean FSH and FSH AUC in E2\u2010pretreated women, but they do not support the hypothesis that acute progesterone augmentation of mean FSH or FSH AUC is impaired in women with PCOS.    3.7  Post hoc sensitivity analyses  Since group differences in achieved progesterone and estradiol concentrations could have been confounding factors, analyses were repeated while simultaneously adjusting for differences in achieved progesterone and estradiol concentrations. Overall, this covariate\u2010adjusted analysis did not materially change the results (see supplemental materials). In summary, the changes in 10\u2010h LH pulse frequency, mean LH, LH AUC, pulsatile LH secretion, basal LH secretion, LH half\u2010life, mean FSH, and FSH AUC attributable to progesterone were similar between the control and PCOS groups after adjusting for differences in achieved progesterone and estradiol concentrations. The changes in 10\u2010h LH pulse mass attributable to progesterone appeared less pronounced in women with PCOS compared to controls after adjusting for these covariates (ratio of ratios, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.22\u20130.99]; uncorrected p =\u00a00.047), but this was not significant after Bonferroni\u2010correction ( p =\u00a00.094).  As explained in Statistical analysis, analyses were repeated after excluding one subject in the control group. While the results of several of these sensitivity analyses did not materially alter interpretation, the results of some were different in potentially important ways (see supplemental materials). In particular, after excluding the one control subject, the following progesterone\u2010related changes were less prominent in PCOS compared to controls: progesterone concentration (ratio of ratios 0.59 [95% CI, 0.40\u20130.88]; Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.034); LH pulse mass (ratio of ratios 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18\u20130.73]; Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.013); pulsatile LH secretion (ratio of ratios 0.39 [95% CI, 0.18\u20130.86]; Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.045); and mean FSH (ratio of ratios 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63\u20130.95]; Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.050). After excluding the one control subject, the following progesterone\u2010related changes trended lower in PCOS compared to controls: LH AUC (ratio of ratios 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29\u20130.96]; uncorrected p =\u00a00.039, Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.078); and FSH AUC (ratio of ratios 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64\u20130.97], uncorrected p =\u00a00.028, Bonferroni\u2010corrected p =\u00a00.084).     4  DISCUSSION  The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that progesterone administration acutely reduces LH pulse frequency in normally cycling controls, but to a lesser degree in PCOS. However, exogenous progesterone did not acutely lower (within 12\u00a0h) LH pulse frequency in controls in this study (Hutchens et al., 2016 ). Similarly, exogenous progesterone did not acutely suppress LH pulse frequency in PCOS, and there was no difference in the degree of LH pulse frequency suppression between controls and PCOS. Thus, the results of this study did not support the primary hypothesis.  The rapidity with which progesterone reduces LH pulse frequency in normal women\u2014whether over hours or days\u2014remains unknown. Permezel et al. reported that, in 4 normally cycling women, 10\u00a0mg intramuscular progesterone (yielding mean progesterone concentrations of 1.6\u00a0ng/ml) lowered LH pulse frequency within 8\u00a0h ( p =\u00a00.05) during the follicular phase (Permezel et al., 1989 ). Another study suggested that LH pulse frequency decreased by about 50% in normal women ( n =\u00a05) within 5\u00a0days of exogenous progesterone (vaginal 50\u00a0mg every 8\u00a0h) and estradiol (transdermal 0.2\u00a0mg/day) during late follicular phase (Pastor et al., 1998 ). This apparent difference was not statistically significant, however, perhaps due to the small number of subjects studied.  In contrast to the current results in normally cycling women, previous studies suggested that exogenous progesterone acutely reduces waking LH pulse frequency within 3\u20136\u00a0h in early pubertal girls and within 12\u201316\u00a0h in late pubertal girls (Collins et al., 2012 ; Kim et al., 2018 ). These apparently discordant findings may possibly reflect the ability of androgens to impact both the degree and rapidity of progesterone negative feedback on LH pulse frequency. In particular, the negative\u2010feedback effects of progesterone on LH pulse frequency may be more rapid during puberty when androgen concentrations are lower. In contrast, when androgen concentrations are higher, as in adult women, LH pulse frequency reduction may require a longer duration of progesterone exposure.  An ability to suppress GnRH pulse frequency appears to be important for normal cyclic function (Lam & Ferin, 1987 ; Soules et al., 1987 ). In PCOS, the GnRH pulse generator is relatively resistant to the negative feedback effects of longer\u2010term progesterone exposure (Blank et al., 2009 ; Daniels & Berga, 1997 ; Pastor et al., 1998 ). Pastor et al. reported that LH pulse frequency was reduced by 60% in controls, but by only 25% in PCOS, after receiving exogenous progesterone and estradiol for 7\u00a0days (Pastor et al., 1998 ). This relative resistance to progesterone negative feedback appears to be mediated by testosterone excess. For instance, sensitivity to progesterone negative feedback was restored in women with PCOS after flutamide (androgen\u2010receptor blocker) administration for 4\u00a0weeks (Eagleson et al., 2000 ). A number of animal studies also suggest that androgen excess impairs progesterone negative feedback on the GnRH pulse generator (McCartney & Campbell, 2020 ). In this study, 12\u00a0h of progesterone exposure may have been insufficient for progesterone to have its full negative feedback effect on the GnRH pulse generator, and it is possible that a longer duration of progesterone (e.g., 24\u201372\u00a0h of exposure) might disclose differences in the rapidity of progesterone\u2010related suppression of LH pulse frequency in PCOS vs. controls.  An a priori secondary hypothesis was that exogenous progesterone acutely increases LH and FSH release more so in normally cycling women compared to women with PCOS. That is, in addition to relative resistance to the negative feedback actions of progesterone on LH (GnRH) pulse frequency, women with PCOS may demonstrate relative resistance to the positive feedback effects of progesterone on gonadotropin release. If correct, this could represent another mechanism for ovulatory dysfunction in PCOS. In adult women, high mid\u2010cycle estradiol concentrations (>200\u2013300\u00a0pg/ml) trigger the gonadotropin surge\u2014characterized by an approximately 10\u2010fold increase in LH and 4\u2010fold increase in FSH levels (Hall, 2018 ). In women, this phenomenon primarily appears to reflect an increase in pituitary gonadotropin responsiveness to GnRH release (Hall, 2018 ). As described above, the pre\u2010ovulatory increase in circulating progesterone may augment estradiol positive feedback at mid\u2010cycle (Chang & Jaffe, 1978 ; Liu & Yen, 1983 ), and some studies suggest that progesterone positive feedback is important for normal surge characteristics (e.g., surge latency period, surge duration, and FSH surge expression) (Chang & Jaffe, 1978 ; Liu & Yen, 1983 ; March et al., 1979 ; Taylor et al., 1995 ).  In this study, mean serum LH and FSH concentrations acutely increased with progesterone administration in both controls and PCOS. However, this study did not formally support the hypothesis that progesterone\u2010mediated augmentation of gonadotropin concentrations is impaired in PCOS. That is, while these data suggest that acute progesterone\u2010related augmentation of LH pulse mass and pulsatile LH secretion may be impaired in PCOS, such differences were not statistically significant after applying the highly conservative Bonferroni method of correcting for multiple comparisons. Importantly, this study was not powered to detect differences in secondary outcomes such as LH pulse mass and pulsatile LH secretion. Also of importance, the PCOS group also had higher BMI and body fat percentage (Table 1 ), and adiposity represents an important potential confounder with regard to factors such as average circulating LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitude (Arroyo et al., 1997 ; Morales et al., 1996 ; Pagan et al., 2006 ; Taylor et al., 1997 ).  The possibility of impaired estrogen positive feedback and gonadotropin surge generation in PCOS is not well studied. In prenatally androgenized female rats and sheep\u2014animal models with PCOS\u2010like features\u2014high\u2010dose estrogen does not induce gonadotropin surges (Foecking et al., 2005 ; Moore et al., 2013 ; Sharma et al., 2002 ; Unsworth et al., 2005 ). One study in women reported that the LH peak magnitude was similar in both PCOS and control groups after 3\u00a0days of high\u2010dose oral ethinyl estradiol (Baird et al., 1977 ). However, this study had several limitations including a non\u2010physiological method of estrogen delivery (ethinyl estradiol, 200\u00a0mcg/day), the use of daily blood samples, and the study of control subjects during the early follicular phase. The possibility of impaired estrogen positive feedback on gonadotropin release\u2014and thus impaired gonadotropin surge generation\u2014in PCOS deserves further study.  In conclusion, this study suggested that LH pulse frequency is not suppressed within 12\u00a0h after oral exogenous progesterone administration (100\u00a0mg) in estradiol\u2010pretreated women, regardless of PCOS status. Progesterone acutely increased various aspects of LH and FSH release in women with and without PCOS. Although this study suggests that progesterone\u2010mediated augmentation of LH pulse mass and pulsatile LH secretion may be impaired in PCOS compared to normally cycling women, such differences were not formally demonstrable.

Vertical lines identify the 95% confidence interval for the GM ratio; the gray horizontal line identifies the GM ratio of equality (i.e., where GM ratio\u00a0=\u00a01); and asterisks denote statistically significant changes ( p <\u00a00.05, pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010intervention). For each group, between\u2010admission comparisons of pre\u2010 versus post\u2010intervention changes (i.e., the pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010placebo change vs. the pre\u2010 vs. post\u2010progesterone change)\u2014reflecting changes attributable to progesterone administration\u2014are expressed as a ratio of GM ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Unadjusted p values (and Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p values in brackets) are for the null hypothesis test that changes accompanying PBO administration are the same as changes accompanying P4 administration. The between\u2010group comparison of such GM ratios (i.e., the change attributable to progesterone administration in the control group vs. the change attributable to progesterone administration in the PCOS group) is also expressed as a ratio of ratios with the accompanying 95% confidence interval; the unadjusted p value (and the Bonferroni\u2010adjusted p value in brackets) is for the null hypothesis test that changes attributable to progesterone in the control group are the same as changes attributable to progesterone in the PCOS group"
