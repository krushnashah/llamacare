    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are associated with cardiometabolic risk in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nLifestyle adjustment, such as increasing physical activity, is a first-line strategy to treat PCOS. The current study aims\nto compare and examine the effect of high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) and combined (COM) training on some\nanthropometric indices and aerobic performance in PCOS females. This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 45 women with PCOS divided\ninto three groups receiving HIIT (n=15), COM interventions (n=15) or control group (n=15) for eight weeks. Some\nanthropometric indices factors including weight, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), body fat percent\n(FP), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as well as VO2maxwere measured at the baseline at the eighth week. Data were\nanalyzed by one-way ANOVA test. Tukey post hoc tests were used to compare the pair differences. After eight-week intervention, weight, BMI, WHR, FP, and VAT decreased significantly in both groups of\nCOM and HIIT (P<0.05) relative to the control group. There were no differences between HIIT group and COM group\nin terms of these variables (P>0.05). VO2maxincreased significantly after COM and HIIT interventions relative to the\ncontrol group (P=0.001); however, HIIT was statically more effective than COM (P=0.011). The current study revealed that both HIIT and COM trainings could be beneficial in improving some anthro-\npometric indices in addition to aerobic capacity, although HIIT was more effective on aerobic performance (registration\nnumber: IRCT20130812014333N143).",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is distinguished as\nthe most frequent endocrine disease with 5 to 10 percent\npatient among females in reproductive age ( 1 ). Multiple\nfactors have been reported to be involved in its pathogenesis\nin which the main one is long-standing lack of ovulation\nresults from hyperandrogenism. Its clinical appearance\nis various and may exist in anovulation, oligoovulation\nas well as hyperandrogenism ( 2 ). Diverse elements like\ndysregulation of mitochondria, inflammatory pathways,\noxidative stress and change in hormones, are seen in\nPCOS ( 3 ). Furthermore, abdominal obesity, abnormal\nlipid and glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR), and\nhypertension ( 4 , 5 ) are related to PCOS development which\nincrease the danger of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence ( 5 ).  In addition to genetic involvement ( 6 ), environmental\naspects such as obesity are found to affect the progression\nof PCOS or even to make patients\u2019 clinical condition\nworse. Diet ( 7 ) or physical activity ( 8 ) are recommended\nas the first treatments for PCOS cure ( 9 ). Metabolic\ncomorbidities and hyperandrogenism have been reported\nto be ameliorated by regular physical activity leading to the\ntreatment of anovulation and in turn fertility restoration. The aerobic training with the intensity of moderate or\nhigh benefits PCOS via ameliorating metabolic and\nfertility related expressions in PCOS individuals. This\ntype of exercise can also positively affect anovulation, IR,\nobesity and cardio metabolic indices ( 10 ).  Nate less, the literature is restricted to sparse randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) limiting to some general\nadvise of training instead of developing a clear exercise\nguideline for PCOS ameliorating ( 11 ). For instance,\ndiet and exercise interconnection, duration, appropriate\nintensity, or modality of exercise have not been clear yet.\nAlso training has positive functions on elevating energy\nconsumption, hormones like cortisol, growth related,\ninsulin, sex related catecholamine, etc. as well as lowering\nfat accumulation ( 12 ). Previous works have indicated\nthat high-intensity interval training (HIIT), containing\nalternative phases of intensity, may increase the total\nmetabolic capacity and ameliorate metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes mellitus and obesity which are both\nimportant in PCOS progression ( 13 ). Sprung et al. ( 14 )\nrevealed that, aerobic exercise interferences, three times a\nweek, 30-60% heart rate reserve, 20-45 minutes, improve\nendothelial function and an adaptation associated with\nreduced CVD risk independent of changes in body weight\nand body composition. Besides, it has been reported that\nresistance training improves insulin resistance, obesity\nand metabolic factors ( 15 ). Thus, it could be reasonable\nto prescribe resistance exercise to patients with PCOS.\nResistance training inhibits osteoporosis and benefits of the\nmusculoskeletal system. Additionally, resting metabolic\nrate, glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, as well\nas body fat could be positively affected by this form of\nexercise ( 16 ).  Moreover, fat hypertrophy, as an increase in cell size\nresulting in a reduction in blood perfusion, eventually\ncauses hypoxia. This additionally leads to cell apoptosis,\nresulting in a greater macrophage cell infiltration and\nimproves the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nConsequently, extra fat tissue can reflect an etiological\nissue in the pathogenesis of PCOS ( 17 ).  To our knowledge, there is no evidence comparing\nthe effects of HIIT and combined (COM) (resistance\nand endurance) training concerning the improvement of\ncardiopulmonary fitness, body composition or weight loss\nin women with PCOS. Moreover, there is a wide variety\nof training structures used in previous studies. Thus, it is\nnot feasible to advise a favorable type of training in PCOS\npatients. Therefore, the purpose of study was to evaluate\nthe effects of these two well-known types of exercises on\nimproving PCOS.    Materials and Methods   Study design  This study was carried out as a randomized clinical\ntrial from April 2020 to December 2020 on the patients\nreferring to the gynecological clinic of Imam Reza\nHospital, Kermanshah, Iran. Rotterdam criteria was\napplied for PCOS diagnosis ( 18 ). Patients were between\nthe ages of 18 and 40. The exclusion criteria included\ntaking oral contraceptives, taking hormone drugs affecting\ntotal testosterone levels over the past three months. As the\nflowing diagram in ( Fig .1 ) illustrates, 51 women with\nPCOS joined in this study; however, 6 individuals were\nnot eligible based on the inclusion criteria. Finally, 45\nparticipants were randomly allocated in 3 groups called\nHIIT training group; COM training group; and the control\ngroup 15 in each group for eight weeks. All of the patients\ncompleted the study. Randomization was done from a\ncomputer-generated sequence, concealed in sequentially\nnumbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, and kept by the\ngynecological clinic physician.  At the beginning of this study, all individuals were asked\nto sustain a normal diet during the project. To increase the\ncooperation of patients, a short message was sent on their\nmobile phone to confirm the time to attend the gym.   Fig 1   Summary of patients\u2019 flow diagram.       Exercise protocols    Combined (RT+MICT) and high intensity intermittent\ntraining protocols  In the COM training group, the resistance training\nprogram consisted 24 sessions of selected resistance\nexercises during eight weeks holding 3 sessions each\nweek. The subjects performed different exercises\nincluding, Bench press, Barbell curl, lying triceps press,\nlat pull down, leg press\u060c leg extension, lying leg curl,\nand standing calf raise ( 19 - 23 ). Each training session\nincluded a warming-up phase (5 minutes), a resistance\ntraining phase [3 sets, 50-70% of one maximum repetition\n(1 RM), 10-16 repetitions] and the cooling-down phase\n(5 minutes). The whole training session lasted 30 to 40\nminutes. Brzycki formula was applied to measure 1RM\nas follow:  1 RM=eq( 1 )   Table 1   Combined training program (endurance and strength training) in eight weeks           Training programs  Weeks of training      First  Second  Third  Fourth  Fifth  Sixth  Seventh  Eighth         Endurance training            Intensity (HRR), %  60  60  65  65  60  65  70  70    Duration (minutes)  25  30  35  30  35  40  35  40    Strength training            Intensity (1 RM), %  50  50  60  50  60  70  60  70    SET  2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3    Repetition  16  16  14  16  14  10  14  10    Rest (minutes)  1-3  1-3  1-3  1-3  1-3  1-3  1-3  1-3            HRR; Heart rate reserve and RM; Repetition maximum.     The duration and intensity of training program was\n30 minutes and 50% in the first week and reached to 40\nminutes and 70% in the eighth week ( Table 1 ). Immediately\nafter resistance training, the subjects were asked to perform\nendurance training which consisted 24 sessions of running\non treadmill with 60 to 70% of the target heart rate (THR),\nwhich was measured using the Carvonen formula as below:  Reserve heart rate=resting heart rate-maximum heart rate  Target heart rate=resting heart rate+(60-70% reserve\nheart rate)  A Beurer pulse digital monitoring were used for\nmonitoring subject\u2019s heart rate (made in Germany, model\nPM80) during training. The duration and intensity of training\nwas 25 minutes and 60% in the first week and reached to 40\nminutes and 70% in the eighth week ( Table 2 ).  The subjects in the control group were also enquired to\ndo only their normal daily routines and avoid doing any\nphysical activities throughout the training program ( 19 - 23 ).  The high-intensity interval training program included\nwarming up for each session (including 15 minutes of\nstandard warm-up), starting with a low-intensity run (50%\nof maximum aerobic speed) and then 3 repetitions of sprint\nrunning for 30 seconds followed by 30. Seconds of slow\nrunning and 5 minutes of dynamic stretching were performed.\nThe high-intensity interval training program for the first week\nincluded intermittent running for 30 seconds with intensity\nof 100% maximum aerobic speed (MAV),4\u00d730-seconds\nHIIT interspersed with 4\u00d730-seconds of active recovery with\n5 minutes of passive recovery between the repetitions. The\nnumber of sets and laps for HIIT program changed according\nto Table 2 for the following weeks.    Outcomes measurements  At baseline and the eight weeks, participants were\ntested for 1 RM to determine muscle strength in the\nCOM and control groups. In the COM training group, the\nresistance training was performed with (50-70% 1 RM)\nand aerobic training (running, 60-70% HRR) programs\nwere performed three times weekly for eight consecutive\nweeks.  Multi stage fitness test (MSFT) was carried out to\ndetermine aerobic power on the treadmill. The speed of\nthe subjects started from 8.5 km/h for one minute. In each\nstage the patients\u2019 speed increased by 0.5 km/h. Aerobic\npower was calculated applying the following formula:  VO 2max =6[measured speed (km/h)]-22.4  This speed was considered as maximum aerobic velocity\n(MAV). HIIT program included intermittent running with\n100% MAV and 50% MAV. The patients in the control\ngroup was asked not to do any exercises during the\nprogram and do only their normal activities ( 19 - 23 ).

Anthropometric quantities were weighed via a professional technician at the clinic at the\nstarting point and the end of the trial. Height was measured by automatic stadiometer\n(Aneascale, Iran). Weight, body fat percent (FP), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and body\nmass index (BMI) were determined by 3D body scanner (Anea 3D, Iran) ( 24 ). To measure the\nwaist to hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference and pelvic circumference (cm) were calculated\nfrom the lateral view.    Statistical analysis  The shapiro-wilk test was used to define the normality\nof data. Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests\nwere applied to compare the differences in each group.\nOne-way ANOVA test was used to assess treatment effects\n(pre-test and post-test in terms of Delta, \u2206 changes) on\nstudy outcomes and comparison among groups. Tukey\npost hoc tests were used to compare the pair differences. Calculations were performed by SPSS software version 23\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and the significance\nlevel of the tests was considered as P<0.05.    Ethical considerations  The current study has been approved by the Iranian\nwebsite of clinical trials registration with IRCT\nnumber: IRCT20130812014333N143. The protocol\nof this work was validated by the Ethics committee\nof Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences,\nKermanshah, Iran (IR.KUMS.REC.1398.1186).\nPaper-based illuminated consent was also attained\nfrom all participants.     Results  The general characteristics of patients have been\npresented in Table 3. As shown, there were no\nsignificant variances among the participants in terms\nof age (P=0.64), height (P=0.91), BMI (P=0.66) and\nweight (P=0.42) at baseline.

Discussion  This trial aimed to indicate a comparison between the\nefficacy of two various exercise training programs in the\ntreatment of PCOS. In this trial, we analyzed the effects of\ntwo different exercise protocols on anthropometrics and\nfitness variables including weight, BMI, FP, WHR, VAT,\nand VO 2max in women with PCOS. The findings revealed\nthat both training programs had beneficial effects on these\nvariables in the patients during eight weeks. There was no\nstatistically significant difference among COM and HIIT\ngroups in BMI, FP, WHR, and VAT, although HIIT was\nmore operative only in VO 2max compared to COM group.  In current study, it was reported that COM (resistant\nand endurance) training could get VO 2max significantly\nincreased. Two recent works on overweight and PCOS\nwomen reported significant decreased amounts of\nVO 2max than healthy controls. A study by patten et al.\n( 9 ), suggested that exercises can improve VO 2max in this\npopulation. In addition, recent evidence showed that the\nresistance training in young and elderly individuals led to\nan elevation in VO 2max ( 25 , 26 ).  Decreased VO 2max seems to be caused naturally by\nage; however, inactivity is its main reason. An elevation in VO 2max can improve oxygen consumption, leading to\na 15% reduction in the risk of CVD related mortality\n( 25 , 26 ) . Moreover, Low VO 2max has been related with\nelevated risk and mortality of chronic diseases. More\nconsequences of decreased VO 2max are impaired capability\nto exercise, impairment in daily activity and quality of\nlife. Sabag et al. ( 27 ) also proved an association between\ncardiopulmonary fitness (CRF) and cardiometabolic\nhealth indices in type 2 diabetic patient. Thus, enhancing\nVO 2max of patients may be beneficial for the treatment of\nPCOS.  We also found reductions in weight, FP, VAT, WHR\nand BMI in COM group, telling that resistant workout in\ncombination with aerobic training can lead to advantages\nin some anthropometric indices in women with PCOS.\nWAT is thought to be a superior free predictor of obesityassociated disorders than BMI ( 28 ). Indeed, central\nadiposity plays a main role in the progression IR and\nT2DM, even in the individuals with standard BMI. Similar\nto our work, Miranda-Furtado et al. ( 8 ), indicated that in\nPCOS patients, WHR decreased after 4 months of strength\ntraining. Moreover, Zhang et al. ( 29 ) investigation observed\nthat daily physical activities can improve weight and BMI\ndramatically in addition to metformin. In contrast, an\ninvestigation reported that resistance training (three times\nweekly for 1 month) did not change BMI or metabolic\nparameters, although it can ameliorate hyperandrogenism\nand reproduction in PCOS patients ( 30 ).  In a recent study ( 30 ) examined WAT as an operative\nsense for central adiposity, while Almenning et al. ( 31 )\nemployed FP to determine overall body fat quantity. As\nFP is the greatest assessment for total obesity, although\ncentral adiposity can estimate the risk for chronic disease\nmore efficiently, we measured both FP and WAT that were\nmeasured in the present study. Kogure et al. ( 30 ) reported\nthat visceral fat in overweight women with sedentary\nlife decreased after a resistance training intervention.\nThis point should be considered that resistance training\nprograms have been different in details such as repetition,\nadministration, and intensity leading to different results.\nHowever, each of these resistance training protocols has\nled to decreased amounts of body fat in women with\nPCOS basically owing to decreased abdominal adiposity.  Based on recent data, endurance training with moderate\nintensity diminishes the risk factors of cardio-metabolism\nin PCOS ( 7 ). In a recent work, endurance training\nimproved symptoms in PCOS women by decreasing\ntotal testosterone level and WAT. Aerobic training could\nreduce heart rate, the levels of total cholesterol and LDL,\nand WHR. Yilmaz et al. ( 6 ) indicated regular endurance\ntraining ameliorated anthropometric variables as well as\nhyperandrogenism in PCOS cases.  Literature evaluating the effects of combination of\nresistance and endurance trainings in PCOS women\nis very limited. A 20-week investigation evaluated the\nimpact of endurance and endurance-resistance training\nprograms joined with an energy-controlled high protein\ndiet on metabolic as well as reproductive parameters in\noverweight/obese women with PCOS. The findings from\nthis study reveal that weight and FP reduced in both\ngroups, but had no effect on cardiometabolic, hormonal,\nand reproductive factors compared to diet alone ( 32 ).  Aerobic training benefits some anthropometric indices\nand several cardiometabolic risk factors free of weight\nreduction in obese people ( 32 ). Resistance training is also\nefficacious for ameliorating insulin sensitivity and body\ncomposition as well as reserving lean tissue in energycontrolled diet, improving declines in resting metabolic\nrate after weight loss. Combining endurance and\nresistance exercise training programs has been observed\nto be more effective in insulin sensitivity reduction,\nglycemic management, and abdominal fat loss in obese\npopulation. Reduced BMI, and particularly abdominal fat\nin PCOS patients, has a key involvement in lowering risk\nfactors for infertility leading to amelioration of hormonal\nand clinical outcomes. Decreased body fat can also result\nin improved insulin sensitivity and total cholesterol in\nthese patients ( 33 ).  In current study, it was reported that eight-week\nintervention with HIIT led to an improvement in VO 2max in PCOS women which was greater than the effect of\nCOM intervention. Previous studies suggested significant\nimprovements in VO 2max following HIIT interventions in\nobesity, cardiometabolic disease and PCOS ( 34 ). Likewise,\na cross-over study evaluated the effect of HIIT along with\ngroup counselling periods on anthropometry and cardiorespiratory health in women with PCOS ( 35 ). The result\nshowed a decline in waist circumference and BMI as well\nas an elevation in VO 2max . Previously, Daussin et al. ( 35 )\nobserved elevated maximal stroke volume and cardiac\nvariables result from 2 months of interval training, but\nnot aerobic exercise, in low-active individuals. Moreover,\nPerry et al. ( 36 ), indicated the effect of HIIT training on fat\nand carbohydrate metabolism capacity. They showed that\nthese types of training resulted in an 18 to 29% increase\nin the content of several mitochondrial proteins and an\nincrease in fatty acid transporters. They resulted that HIIT\ntraining increased not only mitochondrial enzymes and\nfatty acid transporters in the short period but also lipid\noxidation also.  Decreased amounts of body fat percentage and visceral\nadipose index were observed after HIIT intervention for\neight weeks. Similar to our study, a recent trial found\na decrease in body FP after high intensity training.\nThis was similarly stated in other previous studies. For\nillustration, in a recent randomized controlled trial PCOS\nwomen were divided to take high intensity interval\ntraining, or strength training, for three times per week.\nThe results showed that HIIT for ten weeks enhanced\nbody FP and deprived weight loss in women with PCOS\n( 31 ). In consistent to our results, Hutchison et al. ( 37 )\nshowed decreased visceral fat after HIIT in obese\nwomen with PCOS. A meta-analysis study indicated\nthat HIIT was more productive in lowering total body adiposity, whereas lower intensities had a better impact\non abdominal and visceral fat bulk ( 38 ).  Recent evaluations demonstrated that HIIT is potential\nto elevate cardiopulmonary fitness and ameliorate insulin\nsensitivity. Moreover, multiple works have indicated\nno significant weight decline after HIIT compared with\ncontinuous exercises ( 39 , 40 ).  In a recent meta-analysis study seven trials with training\nintensity among 90% and 95% of the maximum heart\nrate, 3 times/week, no less than 10 weeks, were included.\nResults indicated that HIIT alone is beneficial for lowering\nweight and BMI in females with PCOS ( 39 ). In another\nhuman study, obese patients with PCOS received AHIIT+\nmetformin, or metformin (control group). The exercises\nwere performed in three sessions for 12 weeks. After 12\nweeks, no significant changes were seen in parameter of\nWHR, but BMI and fat mass remarkably lowered and\nclinical parameters were improved ( 40 ). Finally, the use\nof an expert instructor to design and monitor the training\nprogram and habitual physical activity changes in all\ntraining sessions and monitoring the dietary change of the\nsubjects are considered as the strengths of this research.\nIndirect meausres of VO 2max and non-gold standard\nmeasures of body composition are the limitations of the\nstudy that might have affected the results.    Conclusion  The findings from the clinical trial showed that both\nHIIT, COM aerobic and resistant training are successful\nin improving some anthropometric indices parameters\nincluding weight, BMI, WHR, FP, and VAT as well as\nVO 2max , as a cardiorespiratory element, in females with\nPCOS. Further investigations involving large clinical\ntrials are needed to further determine health benefits and\nestablish optimal therapeutic exercise dose in PCOS.\nFinally, if these two types of exercises are considered\nsuitable and advantageous as a treatment policy for women\nwith PCOS, additional trials with the aim of facilitating\nand removing the obstacles to exercise especial to women\nwith PCOS is pivotal.",
