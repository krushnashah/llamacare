Beyond its circadian rhythm regulation, melatonin possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties. Recent research suggests that melatonin may significantly impact various aspects of PCOS, including hormonal imbalances, oxidative stress, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders. This has sparked interest in exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of melatonin in managing PCOS [ 3 ].  This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of melatonin's multifaceted role in managing PCOS. We will examine the existing literature, encompassing preclinical and clinical studies, to elucidate the potential mechanisms through which melatonin may influence various aspects of PCOS. The review will explore melatonin's impact on hormonal balance, oxidative stress, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders in PCOS patients. By synthesizing the available evidence, we seek to shed light on the therapeutic applications of melatonin in PCOS and its implications for improving the quality of life for those affected. This review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare providers, and individuals seeking a better understanding of the potential benefits of melatonin in PCOS management.    Review  The role of melatonin in PCOS  Overview of Melatonin and Its Functions  Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone primarily produced by the pineal gland in the brain, although other tissues also produce smaller amounts. Its most well-known function is the regulation of the circadian rhythm, governing the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin levels typically rise in the evening, promoting sleep, and decline in the morning to encourage wakefulness. Beyond its role in sleep, melatonin has diverse functions in the human body [ 4 ]. These include antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties, immune system modulation, and potential effects on the endocrine system. Understanding these various roles is crucial in comprehending its potential impact on PCOS [ 5 ].  Mechanisms Underlying the Potential Benefits of Melatonin in PCOS  Regulation of circadian rhythms: As stated previously, melatonin plays a vital role in regulating circadian rhythms, which govern our sleep-wake cycles. In PCOS, where hormonal imbalances and irregular menstrual cycles are pervasive, melatonin's role in restoring regular sleep patterns is particularly significant. Disrupted sleep patterns in PCOS patients can further exacerbate hormonal imbalances. Melatonin's potential to influence the secretion of sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, may help reestablish a more balanced hormonal environment. This, in turn, can contribute to managing PCOS symptoms and improve overall hormonal balance [ 6 ].  Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects: PCOS is characterized by elevated levels of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which are central to its pathophysiology. Melatonin's remarkable antioxidant properties enable it to act as a potent free radical scavenger, reducing oxidative damage to cells and tissues. Additionally, melatonin's anti-inflammatory effects help mitigate the chronic inflammation often seen in PCOS. By lowering oxidative stress and inflammation, melatonin may reduce the risk of complications associated with PCOS and enhance metabolic parameters, offering a multifaceted approach to managing the condition [ 7 ].  Impact on insulin sensitivity: Insulin resistance is a common feature of PCOS, contributing to metabolic disturbances and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Research suggests that melatonin may enhance insulin sensitivity, making cells more responsive to insulin's actions. By improving insulin sensitivity, melatonin can help manage hyperinsulinemia, a common issue in PCOS, and ameliorate associated metabolic abnormalities. This effect on insulin sensitivity could have profound implications for PCOS management and reduce the long-term risk of diabetes in affected individuals [ 8 ].  Gonadotropin regulation: Melatonin receptors have been identified in the ovaries, suggesting a direct influence of melatonin on ovarian function. Melatonin may modulate the secretion of gonadotropins, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are critical in regulating the menstrual cycle and ovulation. The potential for melatonin to influence the delicate balance of these hormones could have implications for restoring normal reproductive function in PCOS. By supporting ovulatory cycles, melatonin may improve fertility, a central concern for many women with PCOS. Further research is required to fully elucidate the extent of melatonin's impact on gonadotropins and its potential therapeutic application in reproductive health for PCOS patients [ 9 ].

Melatonin's effects on hormonal imbalance in PCOS  Melatonin and Its Impact on Insulin Sensitivity  Insulin sensitizing effects: Melatonin's capacity to enhance insulin sensitivity is crucial in managing PCOS, where insulin resistance is a hallmark feature. Melatonin achieves this by potentially influencing insulin receptor signaling and improving glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. This effect holds significant clinical relevance in PCOS management, as it can help mitigate insulin resistance, which is a condition where cells do not effectively respond to insulin signals. Improved insulin sensitivity is pivotal, as it not only aids in glucose regulation but also addresses the metabolic complications often associated with PCOS, such as hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia. By enhancing insulin sensitivity, melatonin offers a comprehensive approach to managing the metabolic aspects of PCOS and potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes [ 16 ].  Reduction in hyperinsulinemia: Hyperinsulinemia, characterized by elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream, is a common and consequential feature of PCOS. Elevated insulin levels can exacerbate the hormonal imbalances seen in PCOS, particularly by stimulating increased androgen production by the ovaries. Melatonin's role in reducing hyperinsulinemia is significant in this context. Melatonin may help lower insulin levels in individuals with PCOS by enhancing insulin sensitivity. This, in turn, can contribute to reducing androgen production, which is crucial for managing symptoms like hirsutism and acne. By addressing hyperinsulinemia, melatonin offers promise in restoring hormonal balance and alleviating the clinical manifestations of PCOS related to androgen excess [ 17 ].  Regulation of Sex Hormones (Estrogen, Progesterone, and Testosterone)  Reduction of androgens: One of the critical therapeutic aspects of melatonin in PCOS is its potential to reduce androgen levels. Both animal studies and some clinical trials support this effect. Lowering androgen levels is a crucial therapeutic goal in PCOS management, as it directly addresses the androgen excess that contributes to symptoms such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and male-pattern hair loss. By reducing androgen levels, melatonin has the potential to alleviate these distressing androgen-related symptoms, significantly enhancing the quality of life for individuals with PCOS [ 18 ].  Influence on estrogen and progesterone: Melatonin's effects on estrogen and progesterone are multifaceted and context-dependent. While not directly acting as an estrogen or progesterone replacement, melatonin may help restore the balance between these hormones, which is particularly relevant for regulating the menstrual cycle and improving fertility in PCOS patients. Estrogen and progesterone imbalances can lead to irregular or absent menstrual cycles and difficulties in achieving pregnancy. Melatonin's role in influencing the delicate interplay between these hormones may contribute to more regular ovulatory cycles and enhanced fertility in individuals with PCOS. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the extent and specifics of melatonin's effects on estrogen and progesterone in PCOS [ 19 ].  Melatonin's Influence on Gonadotropins and Ovulation  Gonadotropin secretion: Melatonin's influence on gonadotropin secretion is a pivotal aspect of its potential role in PCOS management. Melatonin receptors have been identified in the pituitary gland, which plays a central role in regulating the secretion of LH and FSH. In PCOS, LH and FSH secretion imbalances often disrupt the normal ovulatory cycle. Melatonin may modulate the secretion of these crucial hormones, potentially restoring the regularity of the ovulatory cycle in PCOS patients. This effect holds promise for addressing one of the core issues in PCOS, as ovulatory dysfunction is a primary driver of infertility and menstrual irregularities in affected individuals [ 20 ].  Ovulation induction: Melatonin's potential to induce ovulation is particularly valuable for PCOS patients struggling with infertility due to anovulation (lack of ovulation). Some studies suggest that melatonin supplementation may contribute to improved ovulation rates in PCOS patients. This effect is of great significance, as it directly addresses one of the primary challenges faced by women with PCOS who desire to conceive. By facilitating ovulation, melatonin offers hope to those grappling with infertility, potentially increasing their chances of achieving a successful pregnancy.

Melatonin and oxidative stress in PCOS  The Relationship between Oxidative Stress and PCOS  Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production: Oxidative stress is a pivotal factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS. It is characterized by an imbalance between ROS production and the body's ability to neutralize them with antioxidants. In PCOS, ROS is a notable overproduction, including free radicals like superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. These excess ROS can cause damage to cellular structures, leading to oxidative damage and inflammation. Importantly, this excessive ROS production is intricately linked to several PCOS-related complications, including insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism (elevated levels of male hormones), and endothelial dysfunction. The connection between ROS and these complications underscores the significance of oxidative stress in PCOS pathophysiology [ 22 ].  Antioxidant defense mechanisms: An integral component of the oxidative stress imbalance in PCOS is the reduced activity of antioxidant defense mechanisms. PCOS patients often exhibit decreased levels and activity of endogenous antioxidants. This reduction in antioxidant capacity leaves the body less equipped to counteract the damaging effects of ROS. Consequently, the imbalance between ROS production and the body's capacity to neutralize them with antioxidants exacerbates oxidative stress in PCOS. Addressing this antioxidant deficit is a critical consideration in managing the condition, as it may help mitigate the complications associated with PCOS, such as insulin resistance and the hyperandrogenic state [ 23 ].  Melatonin's Role as an Antioxidant and Its Effects on Oxidative Stress  ROS scavenging: Melatonin can be a direct scavenger of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Melatonin effectively reduces oxidative damage to cells and tissues by neutralizing these harmful free radicals. This antioxidative property is paramount in PCOS, where an overproduction of ROS contributes to the condition's pathophysiology. By reducing the burden of oxidative stress, melatonin can help mitigate the damage associated with PCOS, potentially alleviating complications such as insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and endothelial dysfunction [ 24 ].  Enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses: Melatonin goes beyond ROS scavenging by supporting and enhancing the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). These enzymes play a pivotal role in the body's defense against oxidative stress, helping to neutralize free radicals and maintain cellular integrity. By strengthening the activity of these endogenous antioxidants, melatonin further bolsters the body's capacity to combat oxidative stress. This effect is of considerable importance in managing PCOS, as it addresses the deficit in antioxidant defenses often observed in affected individuals [ 25 ].  Anti-inflammatory effects: Inflammation and oxidative stress are closely intertwined processes, often exacerbating each other. Melatonin's anti-inflammatory properties are precious in PCOS, as the condition is associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By reducing the production of these inflammatory molecules, melatonin indirectly lowers oxidative stress. This interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is integral to the pathophysiology of PCOS, and by reducing inflammation, melatonin contributes to a comprehensive approach to mitigating the oxidative stress burden in PCOS. This, in turn, may help address the metabolic and reproductive complications associated with the condition [ 26 ].
