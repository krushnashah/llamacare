    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders, impacting approximately 5\u201320% of reproductive-aged women worldwide [ 1 ]. This condition is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, androgen excess, and polycystic ovaries and is usually accompanied by metabolic disorders such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance [ 2 ]. Its comorbidities are complicated and include an increased risk for metabolic abnormalities, infertility, obstetrical complications, psychological impairments, and even endometrial cancer [ 3 ]. PCOS is considered a polygenic complex genetic trait [ 4 ] because familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia has been observed in individuals with PCOS [ 5 ] and multiple susceptibility loci relevant to an increased risk of developing PCOS have been reported in genome-wide association studies [ 6 , 7 ]. However, environmental factors also play important roles in the etiologies of PCOS [ 1 , 4 ]. The gut microbiome is an important factor.  The gut microbiome is a complex symbiotic ecosystem that mediates the interaction of the host with the environment. Intestinal microbiome dysbiosis has been widely reported in a series of common chronic disorders and a range of metabolic disorders, including obesity, which suggests that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in human health [ 8 , 9 ]. The dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (DOGMA) theory of PCOS suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis activates the immune system, drives increased serum insulin levels, interferes with insulin receptor function, increases the level of androgens deprived from ovaries, and interferes with normal follicle development [ 10 ]. During the last decade the association between the gut microbiome and PCOS has been reported in some human and experimental studies [ 11 \u2013 15 ], and a discomposed gut microbiome is considered a key hallmark of PCOS [ 16 , 17 ]. Transplantation of Bacteroides vulgatus to antibiotic-pretreated mice leads to glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and ovarian dysfunction [ 14 ]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of dehydroepiandrosterone-induced PCOS rats to recipients triggers disturbances in gonadal steroid hormone imbalance and hepatic glucolipid metabolism [ 18 ].  FMT, the transfer of the gut microbiota from donors to donees for treatment purposes, has been used to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiome on the development of several diseases and has become a hotspot of biomedical research in recent years [ 19 , 20 ]. Although simulating germ-free (GF) conditions with antibiotic-treated recipients is a common experimental practice, the incomplete elimination of microbes may result in confusing outcomes due to off-target effects of the antibiotic instead of the direct effects of the gut microbiota [ 21 ]. Observations of enteritis in investigations of gut microbiota-dependent questions may result in opposing results in antibiotic-treated recipients compared with GF recipients [ 22 , 23 ]. GF animals, which typically have no microorganisms, effectively allow the transfer of the whole fecal microbiota or selective bacterial species and still seem to be the best and most irreplaceable experimental models for studying the interrelationships among bacterial strains and hosts [ 24 ]. The humanized gnotobiotic mouse model provides an innovative and powerful tool for exploring the gut physiology and pathology of the human microbial system.  To investigate the role of the human gut microbiome in PCOS in greater detail, we gavaged GF mice with stool from human patients with PCOS and healthy controls to explore the effects of the human gut microbial consortia on the development of PCOS. We characterized the microbiota and reproductive endocrine features of the recipient mice and evaluated the correlations between them. We demonstrated that the PCOS microbiota could induce lipid metabolic disorders and ovarian dysfunction in GF mice.    Materials and methods   Animal model   Progress of the animal experiment  To explore the relevance of the microbiome to PCOS, stools from PCOS patients ( n =\u200920) or healthy controls ( n =\u200920) were transferred to GF mice to test the effects on the mouse gut microbiomes in terms of PCOS features (Fig. 1 ). All participants were parts of our previous project recruited from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital [ 25 ]. PCOS diagnosis was based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria [ 26 ] with at least two of the following symptoms: (1) oligo-ovulation and/or anovulation; (2) androgen excess, either biochemical or clinical; and (3) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound assessment. Those with thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, androgen-producing tumors, Cushing syndrome, and nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia were excluded. None of the individuals with PCOS had been treated with PCOS-related therapy. The average age of the POCS patients was 28.33\u2009\u00b1\u20094.81 years. Age-matched healthy controls with normal ovarian morphology and regular menstrual cycles without signs of clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism were recruited from the general community. Those who were pregnant or breastfeeding within a year; who received an antibiotic, traditional Chinese medicine, or oral contraceptive within the past 3 months; who had abnormal thyroid or adrenal function; or who were underweight were excluded.   Fig. 1 Illustration of the study workflow. Flowchart of the data collection and methods implemented in this work    Female GF C3H mice (8 weeks of age, n =\u20096) were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. and bred in a gnotobiotic environment. The mice were housed under controlled humidity (40\u201370%), temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C to 23\u00a0\u00b0C) and lighting (12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle) conditions and were allowed free access to both food and water. The GF mice were randomly divided into 2 groups ( n =\u20096 per group). The mice in the \u201cTrans-PCOS\u201d group were given 100\u00a0\u00b5l of the fecal microbiota suspension from the PCOS patients, and the mice in the \u201cTrans-control\u201d group were given the same volume of the fecal microbiota suspension obtained from the healthy controls. The GF mice received oral FMT inoculations once a day during the first week. All the GF mice were subsequently bred regularly for another three weeks until sacrifice. In the fourth week, vaginal smears were taken daily at the same time for 5 days. The estrous cycle was determined on a glass slide for microscopic analysis to determine the dominant cell type following methylene blue staining. The proestrus was distinguished by round, nucleated epithelial cells; the estrus was distinguished by cornified squamous epithelial cells; the metestrus was distinguished by epithelial cells and leukocytes; and the diestrus was distinguished by nucleated epithelial cells and a dominance of leukocytes.  All animals were treated in a humane manner in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines, and anesthetics and sedatives were used to minimize animal distress and discomfort during the experimental process.     Microbiota suspension preparation  Fresh stool samples from 20 PCOS patients and 20 healthy controls were collected according to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) collection protocol [ 27 ]. To prepare the microbiota suspensions, the stools from each group were transferred to an anaerobic hood where they were pooled per group, homogenized 1:4 in saline with 20% sterile glycerol and then filtered through a 70-\u00b5m strainer to remove large particles before being aliquoted and frozen at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C until FMT. Before inoculation, the fecal samples were diluted and resuspended in sterile deionized water to a working concentration of 0.04\u00a0g/100 \u00b5l. All procedures were performed under anaerobic conditions and followed standard protocols as described in previous studies [ 28 , 29 ], despite toxicity studies on the fecal samples before FMT were not performed.    Laboratory examination  At the end of the experiment, before blood collection, the mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of 0.25% avertin to minimize animal distress and discomfort. Blood samples were collected from the orbital sinuses of the mice under anesthesia and then allowed to clot at room temperature for one and a half hours, followed by 15\u00a0min of centrifugation at 3,500\u00a0rpm to obtain the serum, which was stored at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C for hormone and biochemical tests. The levels of testosterone (ab116597; Abcam), insulin (90080; Crystal Chem), and TNF-\u03b1 (ab1793; Abcam) were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for mice.  The levels of fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined with an autoanalyzer (Toshiba, TBA-2000FR).    Morphology and immunohistochemistry  At the end of the experiment, the mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium solution before humane euthanasia to minimize distress to the mice. Adipose tissues (inguinal subcutaneous fat and parametrial fat) were collected and weighed. Ovaries and colon tissues were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dipped in 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin for further staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The ovaries were serially sectioned to a thickness of 5\u00a0\u03bcm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All the slides were placed under a light microscope (Axio Imager. D2; Zeiss) for histomorphological examination and the number of corpora lutea were counted.  Immunohistochemistry was performed on the colons with an occludin antibody (DF7504; Affinity Bioscience) for intestinal barrier assessment. The slides were incubated with the secondary antibody (PV-6001; Zhongshan) for 10 min after being washed with PBS. After 5 min of incubation with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine to change color, the slides were dehydrated and then sealed before observation. The average optical density was calculated with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).    16\u00a0S amplicon sequencing and analysis   DNA extraction and sequencing  DNA was extracted using a TIANamp stool DNA kit (DP328, TIANGEN BIOTECH). The concentrations of DNA were then measured with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After assessment of DNA quality and quantification with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers 341F (5\u2019- CCTACGGRRBGCASCAGKVRVGAAT-3\u2019) and 806R (5\u2019-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC-3\u2019). After the size and specificity of the PCR products were checked and the products were purified with agarose gel electrophoresis, the amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).    16\u00a0S amplicon analysis  Paired-end reads of each sample were split from the raw data generated by the sequencer through the barcode sequence. These paired-end reads were processed using QIIME2 (version 2023.07), and a series of plugins were embedded in QIIME2 [ 30 ]. The Cutadapt plugin was used to trim the PCR primers from the paired-end reads [ 31 ]. Both the profiles of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and representative sequences were obtained via the DADA2 plugin, which performed the steps of quality filtering, denoising, tag merging, chimera removal and dereplication [ 32 ]. The taxonomic classification of ASVs was assigned via the greengenes2 plugin in QIIME2 and the GreenGenes2 database [ 33 ].  The within-sample (\u03b1) diversity indices and distance matrices of \u03b2 diversity were calculated using the diversity plugin in QIIME2, and PCoA was performed and displayed on the basis of the calculated unweighted UniFrac distances with the stats package in R software (version 4.2.2). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate between-group differences in \u03b1 diversity indices. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was applied with the pairwiseAdonis package (version 0.4.1) in R to compare microbial composition differences between the two groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was performed to distinguish significantly different microorganisms between the two groups, with a cut-off of |LDA score| > 3. Correlations between genera and clinical indices were calculated with Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients with the stats package in R. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2, version 2.5.2) [ 34 ] was used to predict functional abundances on the basis of 16\u00a0S rRNA gene sequencing data. Differential abundance analysis of KEGG pathways was performed using the Maaslin2 method [ 35 ] in the R package ggpicrust2 (version 1.7.2) [ 36 ]. A P value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.     Statistical analysis  GraphPad Prism (version 9.0) was used for statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov normality test was used to determine the sample distribution. For normally distributed data, the evaluation of statistical significance between two groups was conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. For nonparametric distributions, the evaluation of statistical significance between two groups was conducted using a two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U test. The data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m., and P <\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   Fecal bacteria derived from PCOS patients induce gut microbiota dysbiosis in recipient mice  We collected fecal samples from the mice at two time points, Day 14 and Day 28 after the start of FMT, and 16\u00a0S rRNA sequencing was carried out to characterize the microbial community structure. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the transplanted bacteria successfully colonized the GF mice during week 2. Over time (from Day 14 to Day 28), we detected a decreased abundance of the genera Faecalibacterium and Parabacteroides in both groups of mice subjected to FMT from PCOS patients and healthy controls. Moreover, a decrease in the abundance of the genera Parabacteroides and Phocaeicola and an increase in the abundance of the genus Phascolarctobacterium were detected in mice transplanted with healthy controls. When comparing FMT from healthy controls and FMT from PCOS patients on Day 28, the relative abundances of Parabacteroides and Bacteroides were greater in FMT from healthy controls, whereas the genera Prevotella , Megamonas and Phocaeicola were present in higher relative abundances in FMT from PCOS patients. For alpha diversity, no significant differences among the four compartments in terms of Faith pd or observed ASVs were found (Fig. 2 B). We observed a clear difference in microbial structure between mice transplanted from healthy controls and mice transplanted from PCOS patients. Specifically, PCoA revealed a significant separation between the mice transplanted from healthy controls and the mice transplanted from PCOS patients on both Days 14 and 28 (PERMANOVA P <\u20090.05). Samples from the mice transplanted from healthy controls at Days 14 and 28 showed no differences, whereas a distinct deviation was observed between the samples from the mice transplanted from PCOS patients at Days 14 and 28 (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, LEfSe analysis was conducted to evaluate the differences in microbes between groups. As shown in Fig. 2 D and E, mice transplanted from healthy controls and mice transplanted from women with PCOS presented different bacterial profiles, driven by various taxa. On Day 14, the family Ruminococcaceae , order Oscillospiraceae and genera Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia were the top-ranking features evaluated using the LDA score in the LEfSe analysis; these features were elevated in the mice that received FMT from the PCOS patients. However, the microbial communities changed significantly over time. On Day 28, mice subjected to FMT from PCOS patients exhibited enrichment of Phocaeicola , Mediterraneibacter , Oscillospiraceae , Lawsonibacter and Rikenellaceae .

Individuals with PCOS had significantly greater body mass indices ( P =\u20090.005), body fat percentages ( P <\u20090.001), serum testosterone levels ( P <\u20090.001), fasting insulin levels ( P =\u20090.006), HOMA-IR values ( P =\u20090.017) and triglyceride levels ( P =\u20090.031) than did healthy controls (Table 1 ). Compared with healthy control mice, mice transplanted with fecal bacteria from PCOS patients displayed increased food and water intake, faster weight gain and greater fat accumulation not only subcutaneously but also in the parauterine zone (Fig. 3 A-E). The group treated with the fecal microbiota from PCOS patients exhibited insulin resistance as revealed by the fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR (Fig. 3 F-G), a tendency to lipid metabolic disturbance (Fig. 3 H-J).

Ovaries from recipient mice from healthy controls presented normal numbers of corpora lutea and follicles at different stages. In contrast, ovaries from recipient mice transplanted from patients with PCOS presented fewer corpora lutea, but no obvious cyst-like follicles were observed (Fig. 4 D-E). Notably, gut microbial dysbiosis is closely related to disruption of the gut barrier [ 37 ]. After oral gavage of microbiota from patients with PCOS, gut barrier damage to the colon tissue of the mice was observed (Fig. 4 F-G). However, TNF-\u03b1 levels in the serum were not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 4 H). Thus, transplantation from PCOS donors into GF mice can transfer PCOS-relevant phenotypes, suggesting that the gut microbiome might be a potential factor in the development of PCOS.

(* P <\u20090.05; ** P <\u20090.01)      Correlation analysis of gut microbiota dysbiosis and PCOS features  We next explored whether specific bacteria were negatively or positively correlated with PCOS-related clinical factors such as TC, LDL-C, TG, and testosterone levels, the subcutaneous fat weight/body weight ratio and the HOMA-IR of colonized GF mice. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that 27 genera were correlated with these clinical factors (Supplementary Material 1 and 2 ). The testosterone level was positively related to the relative abundances of Catenibacillus and Massiliimalia but negatively correlated with Clostridium , Parabacteroides , Negativibacillus and Fusobacterium . The HOMA-IR was positively related to Scatocola , Clostridium , Catenibacillus and Mediterraneibacter but negatively related to Hungatella , Klebsiella and Clostridium . The TG level was positively related to Bilophila , Phocaeicola , Butyricimonas , Alistipes , Extibacter , Dysosmobacter and Scatocola . The TC level was positively associated with Parasutterella but negatively associated with UBA3402 , Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio (Fig. 5 ). The associations of specific bacterial taxa were highly correlated with PCOS-related consequences, supporting the hypothesis that specific bacterial taxa may contribute to specific symptoms of PCOS.

FMT of PCOS fecal samples from GF mice can result in significant consequences of PCOS, such as an obese phenotype, lipo-metabolic disorders, insulin resistance and disrupted ovarian functions. In brief, disturbed microbial communities interfere with host glycemia metabolism, adipocyte function, and insulin resistance, resulting in pancreatic and ovarian dysfunction in PCOS patients. These PCOS features can be transmitted by the PCOS microbiota, and these findings suggest that modulation of the gut microbiota could be highly important for the long-term management of PCOS (Fig. 6 ).   Fig. 6 Schema summarizing key findings. A deteriorated gut microbial pattern in PCOS patients was associated with the PCOS phenotype. PCOS features can be transmitted by the PCOS microbiota. Animal experiments revealed that the gut microflora plays an important role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, ovarian function and gut barrier damage in individuals with PCOS. Created with Biorender.com      Discussion  The high prevalence and increased risk of metabolic complications in reproductive-aged women make PCOS a serious health concern worldwide, and the management of PCOS remains challenging and unsatisfactory, probably due to the lack of clarity concerning its etiology. The gut microbiome has emerged as an important regulator of the physics and pathogenesis of PCOS. The gut microbiome has been reported to be correlated with the PCOS phenotype [ 14 , 18 , 38 \u2013 40 ], although no consensus on PCOS-related microbial features has been reached. A study by Qi et al. provided strong evidence of an active role of the gut microbiome in PCOS pathogenesis [ 14 ]. However, evidence from Han et al. showed that androgens led to PCOS phenotypes independent of the gut microbiome [ 18 ]. Furthermore, the depletion of the microbiome by antibiotic treatment may contribute to alterations in metabolic homeostasis in mice [ 41 ], which implies that the microbiota-independent and direct effects of antibiotic treatment cannot be ignored.  One particular strength of our present study was that we used a GF model for microbial transplantation whose blank microbial background and immunological naivety prevent competition between the resident and newly transplanted microbes, offering an invaluable chance to explore the correlations as well as causal effects of the gut microbiome with the host. Through the manipulation of FMT to GF mice an obese-like phenotype, lipid metabolism disorder, insulin resistance and ovarian dysfunction were successfully induced. We report here that the colonization of mice with gut microbiota from patients with PCOS induces the pathophysiology of PCOS features.  Although GF animals have advantages in in vivo experiments on gut microbiota interactions [ 42 ], what is actually transferred is heterogenous [ 43 , 44 ]. Investigations with gnotobiotic approaches have shown that the gut microbial community in recipient animals substantially differs from that in human donors [ 45 \u2013 47 ].  The loss of microbial species may be attributed to cage and/or isolator effects, sample processing and host incompatibility (strong genetic effects), resulting, in mice, in some taxa failing to engraft while others thrive [ 43 , 44 , 48 \u2013 51 ]. Despite the similar general anatomy of mice and humans, the structure of the gastrointestinal tract remains considerably distinct. The proportionally larger colon, taller intestinal villi and cecum surface area in mice allow a subsequently larger microbial flora than in humans [ 52 \u2013 54 ]. Moreover, the effects of FMT are likely to occur via a pleiotropic mechanism, one feature of which is the alteration of microbe-associated metabolites [ 55 ]. These substances may already be present in the transplant or newly produced by colonization [ 44 ]. In addition, diet, as an important regulator of the gut microbiome, may alter the balance of gut microbial communities [ 56 ], and may exert a stronger influence on PCOS pathology than the gut microbiota [ 16 ].  Based on the present results, we can find only some microbial groups that are closely associated with PCOS. Although these data suggest that metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function may be regulated through gut dysbiosis, the molecular mechanism of specific bacterial species and their metabolites has not yet been confirmed. Studies have reported that both serum and gut metabolite disorders exist in the PCOS population [ 14 , 15 , 18 , 38 ] and that some metabolites may alleviate the PCOS phenotype [ 14 ]. Thus, certain metabolites need to be further identified and validated. Several studies have reported that individuals with PCOS have gut microbiota communities different from those of healthy controls [ 13 , 14 , 57 , 58 ]; however, we did not perform 16\u00a0S rRNA analysis on patient samples. Thus, the similarities and differences in microbiota profiles before and after transplantation could not be compared; however, we did find that FMT from PCOS patients induced increased disruption of ovarian functions, lipo-metabolic disturbance, insulin resistance and an obese-like phenotype in recipient mice. Metagenomic analysis has advantages in understanding the functional potential of microbial communities compared with 16\u00a0S rRNA analysis; however, we performed only 16\u00a0S rRNA analysis in this study, which is also a limitation of our study. Finally, as a key factor involved in the progression of diseases related to gut dysbiosis, immunohistochemistry, one of the most commonly used methods for evaluating gut barrier damage, was performed in this study, and still, future studies should explore this topic in greater depth.
