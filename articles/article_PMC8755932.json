    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multisystem and lifelong disease with\nreproductive and metabolic features. PCOS patients increasingly seek the guidance of\nan internist. Insulin resistance (IR) is common in PCOS and linked to increased\nadiposity and metabolic syndrome (MS) development.  1  IR is independent of body mass excess yet exacerbated by overweight and obesity.  2  Evidence indicates that MS is a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  3  Despite the high incidence of IR and MS in PCOS, neither IR nor MS is\nrecognized as a PCOS diagnostic criterion. According to the recent international\nguideline by Teede et al. ,  1  glucose metabolism should be assessed at baseline in all PCOS patients.\nGlycemic status should be evaluated every 1 to 3 years, depending on the presence of\ntype 2 diabetes (T2) risk factors.  1  In all PCOS women with body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2a7e\u200925\u2009kg/m 2 , a fasting\nlipid profile \u2013 including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride\n(TG) levels \u2013 should be evaluated at diagnosis and monitored depending on the\npresence of hyperlipidemia and the estimated global CVD risk. In all PCOS patients,\nblood pressure (BP) should be monitored annually or more frequently in cases of\npatients with elevated global CVD risk.  1  Guidelines recommend annual measurements of weight, height, BMI, and waist\ncircumference (WC), especially in high-risk ethnic groups. 1 , 4 However, to date, there are no\nstraightforward recommendations for MS screening in PCOS which would use specified,\nunified criteria or biomarkers.  Studies have shown that as much as 70% of PCOS women present with abnormal lipid profiles.  5  Lipid disturbances and increased body fat percentage are essential metabolic\nrisk factors in PCOS. The use of indirect metabolic risk parameters in a high-risk\npopulation such as PCOS women has been extensively studied.  6  BMI and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are simple anthropometric parameters\nwith the strongest associations with metabolic risk indicators.  7  Lipid ratios present a better predictive value than individual lipids in the\nCVD assessment.  8  LDL-C levels and other direct lipids could be optimal despite the elevation\nof other atherogenic lipoproteins and lipid indices in MS patients.  9  To this end, the ratio of TG to HDL-C (TG/HDL-C) and non-HDL-C are becoming\nwidely used.  8  The lipid accumulation product (LAP) introduced by Kahn et\nal.  10  is a novel index of central lipid accumulation based on WC and TG, and it is\npositively associated with cardiometabolic risk. The visceral adiposity index (VAI)\nconstitutes a powerful sex-specific mathematical model using WC, BMI, TG, and HDL-C\nlevels to assess the visceral adipose function and insulin sensitivity. 6 , 10  Most previous studies on the usefulness of body fat indices and lipid ratios in PCOS\npatients have been concerned with IR risk.  11  However, the predictive values or optimal cut-off values of LAP, VAI,\nnon-HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, BMI, and WHtR for MS assessment have not been thoroughly\ninvestigated in PCOS.    Methods  This study aimed to explore the usefulness of six lipid and body fat indices: BMI,\nWHtR, LAP, VAI, non-HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C, as markers of MS risk in PCOS patients of\nreproductive age. We aimed to determine the cut-off values of the above-mentioned\nparameters for assessing MS risk and indicate the superior parameter for predicting\nMS in PCOS.  We enrolled 404 PCOS women aged 18\u201340\u2009years, diagnosed according to the Rotterdam\ncriteria and the recent international guideline at the Department of Endocrinology\nof the Heliodor \u015awi\u0229cicki Clinical Hospital (Poznan, Poland) from September 2016 to\nMarch 2020. 1 , 12  PCOS was confirmed when at least two of the following features were confirmed: oligo-\nor anovulation, biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism (including acne and\nhirsutism assessed with the Ferriman\u2013Gallwey score), presence of at least 20\nfollicles in each ovary measuring 2\u20139\u2009mm in diameter, or an ovarian volume of\n\u2009>\u200910\u2009ml of either ovary. 1 , 12 Other causes of menstrual disorders were ruled out. A total of\n192 eumenorrheic, non-hirsute, middle-aged women with no reported chronic diseases\nwere recruited as controls (CON). Pregnant patients and those taking hormonal\ncontraception within 3 months before the study were excluded.  The incidence of MS was determined according to the International Diabetes Federation\n(IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n(IDF-AHA/NHLBI) criteria (2009) ( Table S1 ).  13  A general comparison of PCOS and CON is presented in Table S2 . After MS diagnostics, the study sample was finally split\ninto the following subgroups: PCOS with MS (MS-PCOS) ( n =\u200964), PCOS\nwith no MS (non-MS-PCOS) ( n =\u2009340), controls with MS (MS-CON)\n( n =\u200912), and controls with no MS (non-MS-CON)\n( n =\u2009180) groups, a comparison of which is presented in Table 1 .

Data shown as median\u2009\u00b1\u2009interquartile range (IQR) or percentage.     Participants\u2019 weight was measured with an accuracy of up to 0.1\u2009kg. Their height, WC,\nand hip circumference (HC) measurements were taken using stadiometers and\ncircumference measuring tapes accurately up to 0.5\u2009cm. WC measurement was taken\nhalfway between the last palpable rib and the iliac crest. Greater trochanters\nserved as the level for HC measurement. Selected anthropometric measurements were\nused for the calculation: BMI\u2009=\u2009body mass (kg)/[height (m)]  2  and WHtR\u2009=\u2009WC (cm)/height (cm).  BP was measured twice with a sphygmomanometer on the right arm, with a 5-min rest\nbetween measurements, and averaged to assess the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP\n(DBP). Patients were classified as smokers if they consumed any amount of\ntobacco.  Biochemical laboratory tests were conducted after an 8-h night fast. They included\nbaseline glucose, glucose at 120\u2009min post-load in the oral glucose tolerance test\n(OGTT) with 75 g of glucose, insulin, TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, thyroid-stimulating\nhormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total\ntestosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone\nsulfate (DHEAS), estradiol (E2), and Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH). Glucose\nconcentration was assessed by the hexokinase method (Cobas 6000; Roche Diagnostics).\nLevels of TSH, LH, FSH, T, SHBG, DHEAS, E2, insulin, and AMH were measured using the\nCobas 6000 Analyzer and dedicated ECLIA sets (Roche Diagnostics). Lower detection\nlimits for hormones assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) were\nadopted from the limits published previously.  14   TC, TG, and HDL-C concentrations were measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method\n(Cobas 6000; Roche Diagnostics). LDL-C levels were estimated using Friedewald\u2019s\nformula: LDL-C (mg/dl)\u2009=\u2009TC (mg/dl) \u2212 HDL-C (mg/dl) \u2013 TG (mg/dl)/5, unless TG\u2009\u2a7e\u2009400\u2009mg/dl.  15  Based on the obtained lipid profile results, lipid metabolism indices of\nTG/HDL-C and non-HDL-C were also calculated. TG/HDL-C was calculated by dividing TG\n(mg/dl) by HDL-C (mg/dl), and non-HDL-C was estimated by subtracting HDL-C from TC.\nThe LAP was calculated as follows: [WC (cm) \u2013 58]\u2009\u00d7\u2009TG (mmol/L).  16  VAI was evaluated using the following sex-specific formula:  17  VAI\u2009=\u2009[WC/36.58\u2009+\u2009(1.89\u2009\u00d7\u2009BMI)]\u2009\u00d7\u2009(TG/0.81)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(1.52/HDL-C) (where WC is\nexpressed in cm, BMI in kg/m 2 , TG in mmol/L, and HDL-C in mmol/L). The\nhomeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated\nas the product of the fasting plasma insulin level (U/L)\u2009\u00d7\u2009fasting plasma glucose\nlevel (mg/dl)/405.  18  Free testosterone index (FTI) was estimated using the following calculation:\nFTI\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(total testosterone/SHBG).   Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica v.13.1 statistical software\n(TIBCO Software Inc., 2017, http://statistica.io ). The\ndistribution of continuous variables was examined using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov\nnormality test. Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables were shown as\nthe median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences in measured parameters\nbetween the PCOS and CON groups were calculated using independent-samples t -test. Mann\u2013Whitney\u2019s U -test was used for\nsignificantly skewed data. Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficients were used\nto investigate the association between the lipid and obesity indices and other\nparameters. Two-tailed p -values of \u2009<\u20090.05 were considered\nstatistically significant for all analyses. Propensity score matching (PSM) was\napplied to evaluate the effect of age and BMI on the selected predictors of\nMS.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to determine\nthe clinical efficacy and optimal cut-off values for lipid ratios in predicting\nMS. The optimal cut-off value for a particular index was identified as the point\nat which the Youden index (sensitivity\u2009+\u2009specificity \u2013 1) was maximum.  Adjusted odds ratios [ORs; 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for MS were calculated\nby logistic regression analysis according to the presence/absence of high levels\nof VAI, LAP, WHtR, and TG/HDL-C after controlling for age and BMI.    Ethics  Informed, written consent was obtained from all participants. The study was\ncarried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki after obtaining\nacceptance from the Board of Bioethics of the Poznan University of Medical\nSciences (552/16; 986/17).     Results   General characteristics of PCOS and CON and comparison of subgroups  The general characteristics of the study sample are described in Table S2 . Results showed that PCOS women tend to have\nsignificantly higher AMH, weight, BMI, WHtR, insulin, HOMA-IR, LH, FSH,\nandrogens, and LAP and lower TSH, SHBG, E2, and HDL-C compared with those of\nCON. PCOS patients suffered from MS significantly more often than eumenorrheic\nCON (15.8% versus 6.2%, p =\u20090.002). Moreover,\nthe IR frequency (HOMA-IR\u2009\u2a7e\u20092.5) in PCOS was 45.0% \u2013 significantly higher than\nthat in CON (30.7%, p =\u20090.01).  IR prevalence was also higher in MS-PCOS compared to MS-CON (90.63% versus 75%, p <\u20090.001). MS-PCOS\npatients were characterized by higher BP, simple and central obesity parameters,\nFTI, DHEAS, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters (except HDL-C), LAP, VAI,\nTG/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C and lower AMH, SHBG, E2, and HDL-C versus non-MS-PCOS. MS-CON had significantly lower AMH,\nBMI, WHtR, LH, FSH, FTI, LAP, VAI, and TG/HDL-C and higher age, SHBG, and HDL-C versus MS-PCOS ( Table 1 ).    Correlation analysis  Linear correlation analysis between lipid ratios and obesity indices and\nbiochemical and hormonal parameters in all PCOS women is presented in Table 2 .

Predictive value of selected parameters  Results of ROC analysis are presented in Table 4 . All six parameters\ndemonstrated a high predictive value in identifying MS in PCOS and CON.\nStatistical significance assessment of differences between areas under the\ncurves (AUCs) in PCOS showed that the AUCs of LAP index (0.946), TG/HDL-C\n(0.941), VAI (0.937), and WHtR (0.908) were the greatest, followed by BMI\n(0.888) and non-HDL-C (0.797) ( Table S6 ). Optimal cut-off values (sensitivity, specificity) of\nLAP, TG/HDL-C, VAI, and WHtR for MS prediction were 30.75 (96.8%, 81.7%), 1.98\n(87.5%, 86%), 1.73 (82.5%, 88.9%), and 0.52 (93.7%, 75.7%), respectively ( Table 4 ).

In CON, all six parameters had a similar predictive value in MS prognosis when\nconsidering AUCs ( p >\u20090.05). AUCs to identify MS were 0.879\nfor LAP, 0.853 for TG/HDL-C, 0.841 for VAI and WHtR, 0.792 for BMI, and 0.750\nfor non-HDL-C. Sensitivity (specificity) of LAP, TG/HDL-C, VAI, WHtR, BMI, and\nnon-HDL-C was 100% (71.1%), 91.7% (71.1%), 80% (82.7%), 90% (76.7%), 91.7%\n(68.3%), and 83.3% (61.8%), respectively ( Table 4 ).  PCOS patients were characterized by a significantly higher BMI and a lower age\nthan CON ( p <\u20090.001, Table S2 ). Therefore, PSM was used to correct the assessment of\nthe MS effect on the level of obesity and lipid parameters by the effect of the\ninfluence of confounding variables (BMI and age). After PSM (model for VAI), all\nsix parameters showed outstanding discrimination of MS in PCOS (AUC\u2009\u2a7e\u20090.9)\n( Table 5 ). The\nAUC values of VAI, TG/HDL-C, LAP, and WHtR were significantly higher than those\nof the BMI and non-HDL-C ( p <\u20090.05) ( Table S7 ). After PSM, the corrected cut-off values of VAI,\nTG/HDL-C, LAP, and WHtR for predicting MS in PCOS were 0.75, 0.97, 32.75, and\n0.51, respectively. Analysis in CON did not give statistically significant\nmodels, so the results for this group were not presented.   Table 5.

Odds ratios for MS in PCOS  After adjusting for BMI and age, the odds ratio (OR; 95% CIs) for MS in PCOS,\nwith TG/HDL-C above the cut-off value, was 140.57 (55.00\u2013359.29) while that for\nLAP was 47.72 (21.72\u2013104.84). In PCOS with WHtR above the cut-off value, OR for\nMS was 37.93 (16.99\u201384.68), whereas in PCOS with VAI above the cut-off value, OR\nfor MS was 21.32 (10.14\u201344.85). Adjusted ORs, lower 95% CI (LCI), and upper 95%\nCI (UCI) for MS in individuals with high TG/HDL-C, LAP, WHtR, and VAI are shown\nin Figure 1 .   Figure 1.

Discussion  Dyslipidemia and obesity are inherent components of MS.  19  Lipid alterations are common in PCOS patients, regardless of BMI.  20  The current approach to MS risk evaluation in PCOS individuals remains\nsuboptimal, although MS and CVD risk are elevated.  21  Finding a single, affordable MS predictor would greatly facilitate CVD risk\nestimation in PCOS. Recent research has suggested that biomacromolecule and lipid\nstructure differences may be seen in early-stage PCOS.  22  Measurements of DHEAS or inflammatory markers such as serum IL-6 were also\nproposed as having prognostic importance in assessing metabolic disturbances in PCOS.  23  However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing and\ncomparing the usefulness and cut-off values of LAP, VAI, non-HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, BMI,\nand WHtR as predictors of MS in PCOS.  In line with previous research, we confirmed that MS is around 2.5 times more common\nin PCOS than in eumenorrheic women. 6 , 24 MS incidence in PCOS varies\nbetween 6.4% and 46% in previous studies, depending on patients\u2019 age, ethnicity, and\nPCOS and MS criteria used. 6 , 24 The comparatively moderate MS incidence we found could stem\nfrom the relatively young age of PCOS patients.  MS-PCOS women are more likely to present with hyperandrogenism, dyslipidemia, and\nother metabolic abnormalities. 5 , 25 Our observations revealed a\n1.5 times higher incidence of IR and worse metabolic and hormonal profiles in PCOS versus CON, as seen in other studies. 5 , 25 Higher obesity indices and\nlevels of LAP, VAI, and TG/HDL-C were also observed in MS-PCOS versus MS-CON. All lipid parameters, except HDL, were higher in\nMS-PCOS versus non-MS-PCOS. The role of MS in aggravating the\ncourse of PCOS needs to be considered in further studies.  Our study showed that selected obesity and lipid indices were significantly related\nto IR and individual MS components in CON and the total PCOS sample ( Tables 2 and S3 ). The increase in the number of MS components correlated with\nelevated LAP, VAI, TG/HDL-C, BMI, and WHtR ( Table S4 ), supporting previous research.  26   Based on the ROC analysis, all six selected parameters constitute representative\nmarkers to assess MS in PCOS and CON. According to Hosmer and Lemeshow\u2019s\nclassification for AUC, the LAP, TG/HDL-C, VAI, and WHtR were described as\npredictors of MS in PCOS with outstanding discrimination ability.  27  Therefore, LAP, VAI, TG/HDL-C, and WHtR seem to be better than BMI and\nnon-HDL-C for recognizing MS risk in both PCOS and CON.  The optimal cut-off values of LAP, TG/HDL-C, VAI, WHtR, non-HDL-C, and BMI for\npredicting MS in PCOS were higher than the corresponding cut-off values in CON\n( Table 4 ). Perhaps,\nsome compensatory or defense mechanisms in PCOS make only higher values of these\nindices alarming in terms of MS risk; however, this remains to be investigated.  28   PSM with well-documented properties for statistical inference was adopted to limit\nconfounding bias.  29  After PSM, all six parameters appeared useful in recognizing MS risk in PCOS.\nOur study found BMI and non-HDL-C to be acceptable for predicting MS in PCOS but\ninferior to LAP, VAI, TG/HDL-C, and WHtR ( Table 4 ). After PSM, the cut-off value of\n5 out of 6 predictors of MS (except LAP) in PCOS was lower than that before PSM\n( Table 5 ), which\ncould result from the lower median BMI and WHtR in PCOS after PSM.  Both VAI and LAP are reliable mathematical models that incorporate anthropometric and\nlipid parameters to predict MS. In line with previous research, our study found that\nLAP and VAI are powerful MS predictors in PCOS.  30  In prior studies, VAI was elevated in PCOS regardless of the phenotype or\nonly in patients with phenotype B.  31  However, VAI levels were comparable between PCOS and CON in our observations.\nDifferences in VAI thresholds could result from variations in participants\u2019\nethnicity, age, BMI, and dietary patterns among various studies.  32  Due to the small sample size of MS-PCOS in our study, PCOS women were not\nsubdivided phenotypically. De Medeiros et al.  33  demonstrated that VAI was the best predictor of MS in PCOS irrespective of\nobesity. According to Bronczyk-Puzon, the VAI cut-off of\u2009>\u20091.675 indicated\nmetabolically unhealthy PCOS women,  34  which is similar to the cut-off we established, possibly because both studies\ninvolved a Polish PCOS population. We demonstrated an increased OR (21.32) for MS in\nPCOS with VAI\u2009\u2a7e\u20091.73.  LAP is an even more easily accessible marker of MS than VAI. Our study confirmed that\nLAP levels are higher in PCOS than in CON. 10 , 30 LAP had the highest MS\ndiagnostic accuracy in all PCOS phenotypes in a study by Bozic-Antic et\nal.  30  It was also the strongest predictor of MS (AUC 0.83, cut-off\u2009=\u200935.63) and IR\n(AUC 0.781, cut-off\u2009=\u200939.73) in a study by Rashid et al.  35  and of MS in a research by Macut et al.  36  (cut-off\u2009=\u200925.9). The differences in LAP cut-off values could result from\nethnic, age, BMI, or WHtR differences. LAP and VAI values depend on the age of PCOS\nwomen. Higher VAI was observed in PCOS versus CON at an early\nreproductive age, whereas at a late reproductive age, higher LAP was found in a\nstudy by Echiburu et al.  37  However, Tola et al.  38  failed to find the predictive effect of LAP on CVD risk in PCOS patients\nafter adjusting for abdominal obesity. Our study adjusted the predictive effect of\nmetabolic markers for age and BMI but not for WHtR.  WHtR has been advocated as a simple, cost-effective and practical predictor\nidentifying individuals at risk of MS.  39  Its higher levels in PCOS versus CON in our study support\nthe literature. 14 , 40 , 41 Our study suggests that WHtR has a predictive power comparable\nto LAP and VAI and constitutes an outstanding discriminator of MS in PCOS. Costa et al.  40  suggested that WHtR and WC are more sensitive and specific MS-predictive\nparameters than WHR and conicity index (C index). Techatraisak et\nal.  41  noted that VAI was the best MS predictor, followed by BMI and WHtR. In line\nwith previous research, our results showed WHtR to be a better anthropometric\nindicator of MS in PCOS patients than the commonly used BMI and should therefore be\nused commonly in future studies. 14 , 39  PCOS women had higher BMI than eumenorrheic women, both in our research and in recent\nstudies. 14 , 42 We demonstrated that BMI could be a useful, inexpensive MS\npredictor, but its accuracy is lower than that of LAP, VAI, TG/HDL-C, or WHtR. BMI\nadvantages include its low cost and accessibility. However, as an indirect body\nadiposity indicator, BMI does not distinguish between fat and muscles.  43  Also, ethnicity influences BMI in PCOS women.  1  The BMI cut-off value we estimated (29.54) is similar to the widely known\ncut-off value for obesity diagnosis (30.0), which constitutes a universal risk\nindicator of common conditions related to excess body mass, including CVD and T2D.  44   The ratio of TG/HDL-C is a classic lipid index showing the balance between the\natherogenic and the anti-atherogenic lipoproteins. TG/HDL-C appears to be a useful\ncardiometabolic predictor in healthy women independent of their body weight status.  45  Contrary to previous observations in which TG/HDL-C was higher in PCOS versus CON, we did not find a significant difference in this\nratio between these two groups, which could result from ethnic differences among studies.  46  However, TG/HDL-C demonstrated an outstanding discriminatory power in the\ncontext of MS in the present study. In fact, the MS risk was the highest when\nTG/HDL-C was used [OR; 95% CIs: 140.57 (55.00\u2013359.29)]. As in our research, the\nTG/HDL-C, with a cut-off value of 3.3, showed a high predictive value of MS in\nKorean adolescents.  47  A similar TG/HDL-C cut-off value of 3.23 was suggestive of MS in another study.  48  A wide range of cut-off values for TG/HDL-C for MS prediction (from 0.61 to\n4.03) were proposed in previous studies, and these values were dependent on sex\n(higher in men) and age.  49  In our study, the cut-off value of TG/HDL-C calculated by the ROC analysis\nwas lower than those mentioned above, possibly due to the influence of age and\nethnicity. Several studies have shown non-HDL-C to be a useful indicator of MS.  50  In a recent study by Paredes et al. ,  8  as much as 25\u201331% of patients with MS had high non-HDL-C, despite having\nLDL-C levels below the cut-off. As Wild et al.  20  found, non-HDL-C levels were higher in PCOS women, regardless of BMI.\nHowever, non-HDL-C was not significantly higher in PCOS versus CON\nin our study. Ethnic differences in non-HDL-C levels were proven previously.  51  The discriminative power of non-HDL-C was lower than that of the other five\nindices in our study.  Our cross-sectional study did not assess the long-term risk of MS development and CVD\nas future outcomes in PCOS women. Thus, prospective follow-up studies are required\nto evaluate the role of lipid and obesity indices in estimating such risk. Our\nresults cannot be directly applied to other nationalities and races because only\nPolish women were evaluated in this study. Further research on the exact cut-off\npoints of all studied parameters should be undertaken to establish values for\nvarious ethnicities, races, and age groups. Moreover, the number of participants in\nsubgroups differed and was relatively low in MS-PCOS and MS-CON, limiting data\ninterpretation. Additional studies on larger PCOS groups with different phenotypes\nshould be conducted in the future to individualize PCOS assessment and treatment.\nFurther research should also consider the level of participants\u2019 physical activity\nas a factor affecting MS incidence and analyze the nutrient and fat intake to\nevaluate its impact on the lipid parameters.    Conclusion  PCOS women with high BMI, WHtR, LAP, VAI, TG/HDL-C, or non-HDL-C levels are at\nincreased risk for MS and should therefore be under the care of an internist. LAP,\nTG/HDL-C, VAI, and WHtR, when compared to BMI and non-HDL-C, were found to be the\nsuperior markers to identify MS in PCOS. These lipid and obesity indices should be\nwidely applied in MS assessment in PCOS during routine and screening examinations.\nBecause they appear to have a similar, outstanding value in MS prediction, they\ncould be used interchangeably to indicate PCOS individuals at risk of MS.\nParticularly, LAP and WHtR seem to be the inexpensive and accessible markers of\nmetabolic disturbances that may predict MS in PCOS women. Employing one of these\nreplaces the need to use multiple predictors, and it may identify women who require\nlifestyle changes or pharmacologic interventions to prevent or manage MS.
