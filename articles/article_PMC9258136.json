    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5\u201315% of women of childbearing age, and it presents with chronic anovulation as the main feature [ 1 , 2 ]. Before ovulation, granulosa cells (GCs) act on oocyte growth, differentiation, and meiosis [ 3 ]. GCs co-operate with neighboring immune cells in the physiological state to produce paracrine mediators, thus promoting ovulation [ 4 ]. Previous studies have indicated that PCOS presents with a chronic inflammatory status, and being the primary source of inflammatory cytokines, immune cells play a role in PCOS [ 5 , 6 ]. The impaired regulation of GCs and immune cells under the pathological state of PCOS may accelerate anovulation [ 7 ]. However, the combined regulatory mechanisms of GCs and immune cells in the progression of PCOS have not been fully elucidated.  Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), a sub-method of machine learning, offers an advantage in explaining the strength and direction of interactions between predictors and outcomes by RFE of non-linear kernels [ 8 ]. CIBERSORT, a gene expression-based deconvolution algorithm, assesses immune cell infiltration signatures [ 9 ]. However, to our knowledge, SVM-RFE and CIBERSORT algorithms have not been used to select potential biomarkers and predict differential infiltrating immune cells in PCOS.  In this study, we aimed to screen novel biomarkers in GCs related to PCOS using a machine learning strategy. Furthermore, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of immune regulation in PCOS, we evaluated immune cell infiltration using the CIBERSORT algorithm and analyzed the relationship of the biomarkers with the infiltrated immune cells in PCOS.    Materials and methods   Data selection and preprocessing  We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using the following keywords: (\u201cPCOS\u201d OR \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d OR \u201cStein-Leventhal syndrome\u201d OR \u201csclerocystic ovarian degeneration\u201d OR \u201csclerocystic ovaries\u201d OR \u201csclerocystic ovary syndrome\u201d) AND (\u201cgranulosa cells\u201d OR \u201cGC\u201d OR \u201ccumulus cells\u201d OR \u201cgranulosa cumulus cells\u201d) AND (\u201chuman\u201d OR \u201chomo sapiens\u201d). Searches within GEO were filtered by \u201cexpression profiling by array\u201d and \u201cexpression profiling by high-throughput sequencing.\u201d Seven datasets were retrieved from the search, and two datasets were excluded due to their lack of gene annotation. The remaining five datasets included three microarray datasets and two RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. Datasets of the same sequencing type were analyzed together. The three microarray datasets, including GSE137684 , GSE80432 , and GSE114419 , contained GC samples from 19 PCOS patients and 15 control subjects. The two RNA-seq datasets, including GSE138518 and GSE155489 , contained GC samples from seven PCOS patients and seven control subjects. The three microarray datasets were considered as the train datasets due to their larger sample sizes compared to those of the two RNA-seq datasets, and the two RNA-seq datasets were then used for test validation. The R package\u2019s \u201csave and standardization\u201d algorithms were used to preprocess batch effect removal on the train and test datasets.    Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)  The R package limma was used to analyze DEGs in GCs between PCOS patients and control subjects, and genes with a P -value of <0.05 and log fold change >1 were selected as DEGs. Heatmaps and volcano plots were made using the R packages pheatmap and ggplot2 to further visualize the up- and down-regulated DEGs, respectively.    Functional enrichment analyses  Gene ontology (GO) functional analyses of DEGs were performed to evaluate their biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) using the R package clusterProfiler . Moreover, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of DEGs were conducted using the same R package. Disease ontology (DO) enrichment analysis was performed through the R package DOSE . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA v4.1.0 to further assess the related function enrichments of DEGs. KEGG maps of biological functions associated with a P -value of <0.05 were determined to be significantly enriched, and the results of GSEA with a P -value of <0.05 were considered significant. In addition, the false discovery rate-adjusted P -value was defined as the Q -value, and the cutoff criteria for GO and DO analyses were set as a Q -value of <0.05.    A comprehensive strategy for screening candidate biomarkers  We used a comprehensive selection method based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model and SVM-RFE algorithm to analyze PCOS-related biomarkers. The LASSO logistic regression model selects biomarkers using LASSO in the R package glmnet [ 10 ]. SVM-RFE is an iterative approach combining linear support vector machines with feature selection and backward elimination, which is implemented with the R packages e1071 , kernlab , and caret [ 8 ]. To further assess the diagnostic ability of candidate biomarkers, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculations of its area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were performed using the R package pROC . P <\u20090.05 indicated significant differences.    Immune infiltration estimations via CIBERSORT  The CIBERSORT ( https://cibersort.stanford.edu/ ) calculation algorithm was used to predict the differential abundance of immune infiltrating cells between PCOS patients and control subjects. Correlation heatmaps and violin plots were prepared to visualize the results of CIBERSORT using the R packages corrplot and ggplot2 , respectively [ 9 ].    Interaction analysis of selected biomarkers  Spearman correlation coefficients calculated using the R statistical package evaluated the relationships between hub biomarkers and infiltrating immune cells. The interaction results were visualized through the R package ggplot2 .    Study subjects  In this study, we recruited 10 women who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) at the Reproductive Center of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, between August 2021 and October 2021. According to the Rotterdam criteria, five patients were diagnosed as having PCOS, and\u00a0five control women were either infertile due to fallopian tube obstruction or could not conceive due to their husband\u2019s subfertility. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic metabolic disease, or endometriosis. The Health Research Ethics Board of the Shengjing Hospital approved the study.    Sample acquisition  Individual subjects were administered recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, 150\u2013187.5\u2009IU; Gonal-f, Follitropin Alfa, Serono) and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for ovarian hyperstimulation. The subjects were given 250\u2009\u03bcg human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Profasi; Serono) if two follicles had a diameter of 18\u2009mm and the serum contents of E2 were 300\u2009pg/mL per predominant follicle. Then, 36\u2009h after hCG administration, follicular fluid (2\u2009mL) was extracted from the predominant follicles through a vaginal puncture under ultrasound echo guidance. The collected follicular fluid was immediately centrifuged at 700 g for 5\u2009min. The precipitates were suspended and gently layered onto 3\u2009mL of 50% lymphocyte separation medium (Biosharp, Anhui, China). After centrifugation at 700 g for 10\u2009min, GCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Biosharp), collected in TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until RNA extraction.    Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)  Total RNA in GC samples was extracted using the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the instructions of the PrimeScript\u2122 RT Reagent Kit and gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, China). The reaction was performed using a thermal cycler at 42\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 37\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min, and 85\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s. RNA transcript levels were quantified by RT-qPCR using the TaKaRa-SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II (TaKaRa, Japan) and specific primers (Supplementary Table 2 ) performed on the ABI ViiA 7 Real-time PCR Platform (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The qPCR reaction comprised 10-\u03bcL SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (2\u00d7), 0.8-\u03bcL PCR forward primer (10\u2009\u03bcM), 0.8-\u03bcL PCR reverse primer (10\u2009\u03bcM), 6.4-\u03bcL RNase-free ddH2O, and 2-\u03bcL cDNA (Takara, Japan). PCR amplification was performed as follows: predegeneration at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 40\u2009cycles of degeneration at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, and annealing at 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s. GAPDH served as an internal control, and 2- \u0394\u0394Ct was used for data analysis of relative gene expression.     Results   Identification of DEGs  Figure 1 shows the overall workflow of this study. DEGs were analyzed in the three train datasets GSE137684 , GSE80432 , and GSE114419 , including GC samples of 19 PCOS patients and 15 control subjects. A total of 1265 DEGs, comprising 387 upregulated genes and 878 downregulated genes, were screened in the PCOS group, compared with the control group. Heatmaps were subsequently drawn to display these DEGs (Fig. 2 ).

The heatmap presents the overall expression with P <\u20090.05 in the PCOS and control groups     Enrichment analysis  We performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on DEGs using the R package clusterProfiler . The top 10 BP, CC, and MF were identified according to the screening criteria of Q -value being\u2009<0.05, with the alcohol metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, and isomerase activity being the enriched functions in the GC samples of PCOS patients (Fig. 3 A). KEGG analysis results revealed several enriched pathways in PCOS, including autophagy, AMPK signaling pathway, biosynthesis of cofactors, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 B). The enriched related diseases of DEGs were obtained with a Q -value of <0.05 via DO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, GSEA analysis indicated close relationships of enriched gene sets with the activation of immune response, adaptive immune response, and alpha-beta T cell activation and differentiation in the PCOS group (Fig. 3 D, E).

As shown in a Venn diagram (Fig. 4 C), examination of these two gene sets helped us identify four characteristic PCOS-related biomarkers, namely A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5), apolipoprotein H (APOH), HD domain containing 3 (HDDC3), and syndecan 2 (SDC2).

Moreover, two datasets ( GSE138518 and GSE155489 ) were used to validate the expressions of these four potential biomarkers. Differential expression of two genes, namely HDDC3 and SDC2, was verified in the test group (Fig. 4 E). HDDC3 and SDC2 were expressed significantly lower in the GCs of PCOS patients than in those of control subjects. Moreover, ROC analyses of the test datasets indicated that HDDC3 and SDC2 had an AUC of 0.918 and 0.816, respectively (Fig. 4 F). Using ROC curves, we also detected the cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity of HDDC3, SDC2, and their combination for the prediction of PCOS (Supplementary Table 3 ). Notably, the combination of HDDC3 and SDC2 yielded an AUC of >0.9 in predicting PCOS in both train and test groups (Fig. 4 G). However, there was no difference in the expression of AKAP5 and APOH between PCOS patients and control subjects in the test group, and the ROC analysis results of AKAP5 and APOH in the test group were unsatisfactory (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Therefore, we obtained two hub biomarkers with PCOS-specific expression, namely HDDC3 and SDC2.    Validation of hub biomarkers in clinical samples  To verify the above bioinformatics analyses, we investigated the expression of the two hub biomarkers in GC samples from five PCOS patients and five control subjects (Fig. 4 H). Using RT-qPCR, we identified that HDDC3 and SDC2 were significantly downregulated in GCs of PCOS patients compared with those of control subjects, which was consistent with our bioinformatics results.    Immune cell infiltration analysis  The infiltration of immune cells around GCs was predicted using the CIBERSORT algorithm, as shown in Fig. 5 A and B. Compared with other immune cells, T cells CD4 memory resting and neutrophils dominated in both PCOS and control groups. A significant difference was detected in the infiltration of activated mast cells ( P =\u20090.033) and eosinophils ( P =\u20090.040) between groups, indicating the potential role of mast cells and eosinophils in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome     Relationship of biomarkers with infiltrating immune cells  Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationships of biomarkers with infiltrating immune cells. We identified that the hub biomarker HDDC3 was positively correlated with T regulatory cells ( R =\u20090.46, P =\u20090.0064), activated mast cells ( R =\u20090.42, P =\u20090.014), and monocytes ( R =\u20090.39, P =\u20090.024) but negatively correlated with activated memory CD4 T cells ( R =\u2009\u22120.41, P =\u20090.016; Fig. 6 ). Meanwhile, we identified that the hub biomarker SDC2 was positively correlated with activated mast cells ( R =\u20090.51, P =\u20090.0021), plasma cells ( R =\u20090.47, P =\u20090.0051), and M2 macrophages ( R =\u20090.36, P =\u20090.038) but negatively correlated with eosinophils ( R =\u2009\u22120.44, P =\u20090.01) and neutrophils ( R =\u2009\u22120.37, P =\u20090.031; Fig. 7 ).

SDC2, syndecan 2      Discussion  Recently, machine learning strategies have emerged as powerful tools to investigate the underlying relationships of high-dimensional data and select the best parameters for gene selection among all DEGs with biological significance [ 11 ]. Some studies have focused on exploring PCOS biomarkers via various machine learning algorithms [ 12 , 13 ]. For example, Xie et al . integrated artificial neural networks and random forest algorithms to explore diagnostic markers in PCOS [ 12 ]. We herein combined the LASSO logistic regression model and SVM-RFE algorithm to determine the potential biomarkers and further verified their expression in the test datasets. The hub biomarkers identified by us in this study seem to have higher AUCs, with an average AUC of >0.8 in both train and test datasets, indicating their potential predictive abilities in PCOS.  The two hub biomarkers identified by us are HDDC3 and SDC2. HDDC3 is a cytosolic NADPH phosphatase that regulates ferroptosis [ 14 ], and ferroptosis is reportedly involved in endocrine and metabolic diseases, including PCOS [ 15 ]. SDC2 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that promotes TGF\u03b2-induced immunosuppressive genes and facilitates T cell proliferation [ 16 ]. Furthermore, silencing of SDC2 inhibited macrophages\u2019 phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and consequently resulted in tissue injury [ 17 ]. This study predicted a positive relationship between SDC2 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, which is consistent with previous studies. Thus, we speculated that the downregulation of SDC2 in PCOS is associated with the immune dysregulation of PCOS. To our knowledge, HDDC3 and SDC2 have not been reported in PCOS-related studies yet; however, we considered their potential roles in the metabolic and immune processes of PCOS.  PCOS presents with chronic low-grade inflammation [ 5 , 6 ]. The inflammatory process activates locally infiltrating immune cells, thus leading to immune dysfunction [ 18 ]. In this study, KEGG and GSEA analyses indicated that most DEGs between PCOS and control groups were enriched in immune activation functions. CIBERSORT was used to evaluate immune infiltration in PCOS, which revealed a decreased infiltration of activated mast cells and an increased infiltration of eosinophils in PCOS. Eosinophils increase with mast cell activation [ 19 ], and it has been reported that the infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells commonly mirrors each other [ 20 ]. Our finding of opposite infiltrative patterns of mast cells and eosinophils and the potential roles of these two cells in PCOS need to be further clarified. Furthermore, the hub biomarkers HDDC3 and SDC2 were positively correlated with activated mast cells, and SDC2 was negatively correlated with eosinophils. Further experiments are necessary to define the intricate relationships of the hub biomarkers with immune infiltration in PCOS.  Recent attention has been given to the identification of diagnostic biomarkers for PCOS [ 21 , 22 ]. In this study, the decreased transcript levels of HDDC3 and SDC2 were validated in granulosa cells from women with PCOS. This finding indicated that HDDC3 and SDC2 might serve as candidate biomarkers for PCOS in clinical practice; however, the clinical significance of them still requires further systematic exploration. Moreover, considering the potential relationships of HDDC3 and SDC2 with immune cells in PCOS, future studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of HDDC3 and SDC2 in PCOS will be performed.  Nevertheless, several limitations of this study also need to be considered, including a lack of existing datasets with a large sample size, data heterogeneity, and platform differences. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether HDDC3 and SDC2 contribute to the pathogenesis of immune infiltration in PCOS or are only potential biomarkers of this process.    Conclusion  This study identified HDDC3 and SDC2 as candidate biomarkers of PCOS and evaluated their potential interactions with immune cells during the pathogenesis of PCOS. Additionally, immune cell infiltration, including the differential infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells, is involved in PCOS. Further research with a larger sample size and more predictive means of clinical applicability are needed to verify these results.
