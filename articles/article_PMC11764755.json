Global estimates suggest that the condition affects between 5\u00a0% and 20\u00a0% of women throughout their reproductive years. PCOS development is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and ethnic factors [ 2 ]. Women with PCOS have an impaired metabolite included hyperandrogenism, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and infertility due to unovulation [ 3 ]. There is increasing evidence that genetic and epigenetic factors are believed to play critical role in PCOS progression [ [4] , [5] , [6] ]. However, despite much research over the years, the exact underlying pathological mechanisms of PCOS remain uncertain.  VDR, a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, is responsible for vitamin D's effect [ 7 ]. Vitamin D regulates the female reproductive system through steroidogenesis and corresponding hormones: anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone in granulosa cells (GCs) and glucose hemostasis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells [ 8 ]. The VDR gene is located on chromosome 12q13.11 and encompasses 14 exons that encode a 427-amino-acid protein [ 9 ]. The VDR gene features five commonly reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), notably Apa I (rs7975232) located in intron 8, Bsm I (rs1544410) located in intron 8, Cdx2 (rs11568820) located in exon 1, Fok I (rs10735810) located in exon 2, and Taq I (rs731236) located in exon 9 [ 9 ].  Understanding the associations between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing PCOS and infertility is critical for improving the diagnosis, treatment, and management of this condition. The controversial evidence shows an association between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of PCOS and infertility [ 10 ]. However, the relationship between the VDR gene polymorphisms and PCOS remained unclear. Previous meta-analyses have identified several VDR gene polymorphisms that play a role in the development of PCOS, including Apa I, Bsm I, Fok I [ 11 ]. The current systematic review and meta-analysis's main objective was to evaluate the associations between VDR gene polymorphisms and PCOS risk. A total of 5618 participants, focusing on five key VDR gene polymorphisms: Apa I (rs7975232), Bsm I (rs1544410), Cdx2 (rs11568820), Fok I (rs22228570), and Taq I (rs731236), were selected to evaluate risk associations for PCOS development. An updated meta-analysis that included more population studies may address research gaps in VDR gene polymorphisms as well as the risk for PCOS. We hypothesize that VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of PCOS in women.    2  Methods  The current systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the recommendations established by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA 2020) [ 12 ]. This systematic review and meta-analysis were registered on the PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024564851. The review protocol for this study is accessible at ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ).   2.1  Eligibility criteria  Inclusion criteria included: (i) observational studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies; (ii) women diagnosed with PCOS; (iii) investigations to determine VDR gene polymorphisms Apa I (rs7975232), Bsm I (rs1544410), Cdx2 (rs11568820), Fok I (rs2228570), and Taq I (rs731236). (iv) Studies that have reported the frequencies of genotypes or alleles by comparing at least two groups, a group including PCOS or cases against non-PCOS or healthy or control groups; (v) Studies that report ORs and 95\u00a0% CIs. Exclusion criteria included: (i) studies without a clear diagnosis of PCOS; (ii) studies not reporting on VDR gene polymorphisms; (iii) all other types of studies, clinical trial studies, reviews, meta-analyses, cross-sectional studies, case reports, case series, commentaries, letters to the editor, and reports; (iv) case-control studies without reporting inclusion criteria; (v) repetitive and non-English language studies; (vi) studies without reporting ORs and 95\u00a0% CIs.    2.2  Methodology for searching and screening  We employed a number of worldwide databases, for instance, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, to perform the meta-analysis. These databases were searched for papers published up to July 2024, using specific search keywords and their synonyms: \"vitamin D receptor,\" or \"VDR,\" and \"polycystic ovary syndrome,\" or \"PCOS,\" and \"SNP,\" or \"polymorphism.\" In addition, we manually searched these databases, closely checking the references to pertinent research and scanning the published literature for any other related studies that might not have come up in the first database search. Two independent writers (R.H., M.P.) separately conducted the screening process (abstracts and full text using eligibility criteria) to guarantee correctness and thoroughness.    2.3  Data extraction and management  Data were obtained using a standardized form and were separately collected by two reviewers from the chosen studies. Corresponding authors were contacted as necessary to provide clarification or validate data. We investigate the association between VDR gene polymorphisms ( Apa I, Bsm I, Cdx2, Fok I, and Taq I) and the susceptibility to PCOS in women. This data covered a number of important variables, including the study's site, authors, year of publication, sample size, distinctive characteristics, population characteristics, age distribution, research site, participant ethnicity, and PCOS criteria. Details about the genotyping techniques utilized, the number of cases and controls related to the VDR gene polymorphisms, the outcome measured, and the published results are all included. It was considered that missing data would not be reported if the authors could not be reached for clarification.    2.4  Bias risk  The methodological quality and risk assessment of non-randomized studies in meta-analyses was conducted using the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale checklist. There are eight components total, broken down into three categories: ascertainment of exposure, comparability of cases and controls, and selection of cases and controls. An item may receive a maximum of one star for each of the first two categories and a maximum of two stars for comparability. There was a 0\u20139 point scoring system. A score of six or higher indicates the excellent quality of a study [ 13 ]. Two reviewers (R.H. and M.P.) independently conducted the risk of bias evaluation. In cases of inconsistency, a third author (H.A.B.) was consulted, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus. No automation tools were used during this process.    2.5  Statistical analysis  The Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was used to evaluate the control genotype distribution ( p <\u00a00.05 was deemed relevant). The influence on a forest plot and the intensity of the association between VDR polymorphisms and the risk of PCOS were estimated using the computation of ORs and 95\u00a0% CIs in six distinct genetic models. Apa I (rs7975232) allele contrast (A vs. a), recessive model (AA vs. Aa\u00a0+\u00a0aa), dominant model (AA\u00a0+\u00a0Aa vs. aa), over dominant model (Aa vs. AA\u00a0+\u00a0aa), AA vs. aa model, and AA vs. Aa model; Bsm I (rs1544410) allele contrast (B vs. b), recessive model (BB vs. Bb\u00a0+\u00a0bb), dominant model (BB\u00a0+\u00a0Bb vs. bb), over dominant model (Bb vs. BB\u00a0+\u00a0bb), BB vs. bb model, and BB vs. Bb model. Cdx2 (rs11568820) allele contrast (C vs. c), recessive model (CC vs. Cc +\u00a0cc), dominant model (CC\u00a0+ Cc vs. cc), over-dominant model ( Cc vs. CC\u00a0+\u00a0cc), CC vs. cc model, and CC vs. Cc model. Fok I (rs2228570) allele contrast (F vs. f), recessive model (FF vs. Ff\u00a0+\u00a0ff), dominant model (FF\u00a0+\u00a0Ff vs. ff), over-dominant model (Ff vs. FF\u00a0+\u00a0ff), FF vs. ff model, FF vs. Ff model, and Ff vs. ff model; Taq I (rs731236) allele contrast (T vs. t), recessive model (TT vs. Tt\u00a0+\u00a0tt), dominant model (TT\u00a0+\u00a0Tt vs. tt), over dominant model (Tt vs. TT\u00a0+\u00a0tt), TT vs. tt model, and TT vs. Tt model; Also, I 2 and Q Cochrane tests were used to evaluate the heterogeneity throughout the studies. Egger's test ( p <\u00a00.05) and funnel plots were utilized to test for publication biases. MetaGenyo, an online tool for doing a meta-analysis of genetic association research, was used for all statistical analyses [ 14 ].     3  Results   3.1  Characteristics of eligible studies  Fig. 1 illustrates the study selection method for this meta-analysis, which adhered to the PRISMA flow diagram. Initially, we conducted a comprehensive search of 1487 records from the aforementioned databases. We excluded a total of 874 records from the search results due to their duplication. After screening the remaining 613 records, we excluded 473 records because they were duplicates, unrelated to the VDR gene or PCOS, or consisted of reviews. 140 publications were sought to be retrieved, of which 72 records were not retrieved. The remaining 68 publications were downloaded, subjected to a meticulous, complete publishing evaluation and assessed for eligibility. We excluded 48 studies due to various types of studies, letters, RCTs, and meta-analyses, as well as their lack of a case-control design and inadequate data for calculating the ORs and 95\u00a0% CI. In conclusion, a total of 20 papers [ 9 , 10 , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] ] were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Notably, the objective criteria, including the PCOS diagnostic criteria, healthy control groups, mean or age of study group, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of nonrandomized studies, genotyping techniques that were employed, study sets, the ethnicity of the population that was included in the meta-analysis, and the total cases and controls for each study. The included studies provide the genotype and allele frequencies, in addition to other features ( Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 ).

Fig. 16     3.8  Subgroup analysis based on the ethnicity differences  A subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate the potential influence of patient BMI and ethnicity on the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and PCOS risk. The analysis of the Apa I (rs7975232) gene polymorphism in overweight and obese individuals revealed a significant association in the allele contrast (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20131.39, p =\u00a00.018), the recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.57, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.19\u20132.07, p =\u00a00.001), the dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.09, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87\u20131.36, p =\u00a00.414), the pairw1 (AA vs. aa) model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.52, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12\u20132.07, p =\u00a00.006), and the pairw2 (AA vs. Aa) model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.59, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.17\u20132.15, p =\u00a00.002).

Vitamin D controls the female reproductive system by supporting the production of steroids and related hormones, including AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone in GCs, and glucose hemostasis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells [ 8 ]. The VDR gene is found on chromosome 12q13.11 and is comprised of 14 exons that are responsible for encoding a protein that is 427 amino acids in length [ 9 ]. A total of five SNPs has been found to be present in the VDR gene. These SNPs include Apa I (rs7975232) situated in intron 8, Bsm I (rs1544410) located in intron 8, Cdx2 (rs11568820) located in exon 1, Fok I (rs10735810) located in exon 2, and Taq I (rs731236) placed in exon 9 [ 9 ]. It is essential to get an understanding of the relationships between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing PCOS and infertility in order to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and management of this disorder. There is a correlation between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of PCOS and infertility, according to the data that has been criticized [ 10 ]. On the other hand, the association between the VDR gene polymorphisms and PCOS remained unclear. Apa I, Bsm I, and Fok I are only a few of the VDR gene polymorphisms that have been identified as having a role in the development of PCOS by previous meta-analyses [ 11 ].  The present systematic review and meta-analysis focused on five important VDR gene polymorphisms, including Apa I (rs7975232), Bsm I (rs1544410), Cdx2 (rs11568820), Fok I (rs22228570), and Taq I (rs731236), as well as the risk for the development of PCOS. The total number of participants in the study was 5618. An updated meta-analysis that incorporated more population studies might address research gaps in VDR gene polymorphisms as well as the risk for PCOS and infertility. VDR gene polymorphisms were shown to be significantly related to an elevated risk of PCOS and infertility in females, according to the findings of our study.  Collectively, our results suggested a significant association between the existence of Apa I (rs7975232) polymorphism and an increased risk of developing PCOS and infertility. Supporting our findings, prior meta-analyses have shown a significant correlation between Apa I and heightened susceptibility to PCOS [ 11 , 33 ]. In Shi et al.'s meta-analysis, 2825 cases and controls were examined for a substantial association between the existence of Apa I (rs7975232) polymorphism and susceptibility to PCOS (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.19, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20131.34, p =\u00a00.004) [ 11 ]. According to a previous meta-analysis, 1027 case and control participants were included in the Shahmoradi et al. meta-analysis to investigate whether there was a significant association between the presence of the Apa I (rs7975232) polymorphism and PCOS susceptibility (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.466, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20131.97, p =\u00a00.01) [ 33 ]. Our meta-analysis was conducted on a relatively larger sample size consisting of 3650 cases and controls with a significant association between the Apa I polymorphism (rs7975232) in the allele contrast (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20131.30, p <\u00a00.01), the recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.53, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), the over dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.03, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u20131.19, p <\u00a00.01), and the AA vs. aa model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00\u20131.53, p <\u00a00.01); however, there was no significant association in the dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.21, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.39, p =\u00a00.17).  In addition, the findings of our study indicated a strong association between the presence of the Bsm I (rs1544410) polymorphism and a higher susceptibility to developing PCOS and infertility. Corroborating our results, previous studies have shown a substantial association between Bsm I and increased vulnerability to PCOS [ 11 , 34 ]. In Shi et al.'s meta-analysis, 2099 cases and controls were examined for a substantial association between the existence of the Bsm I (rs1544410) polymorphism and susceptibility to PCOS (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20131.53, p =\u00a00.011) [ 11 ]. In accordance with a previous meta-analysis, 1813 case and control participants were included in the Niu et al. meta-analysis to investigate whether there was a significant association between the presence of the Bsm I (rs1544410) polymorphism and PCOS susceptibility (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.62, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.24\u20132.11, p <\u00a00.01) [ 34 ]. The present meta-analysis was performed on a comparatively larger sample set, including 2796 participants, and reported a significant association between the Bsm I polymorphism (rs1544410), (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08\u20131.37, p <\u00a00.01, I 2 =\u00a071\u00a0%), the recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.29, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.60, p <\u00a00.01, I 2 =\u00a058\u00a0%), the dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.26, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.51, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, I 2 =\u00a063\u00a0%), the over dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86\u20131.20, p =\u00a00.04, I 2 =\u00a048\u00a0%), the BB vs. bb model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.44, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u20131.88, p <\u00a00.01, I 2 =\u00a062\u00a0%), and the BB vs. Bb model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.23, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.98\u20131.55, p <\u00a00.04, I 2 =\u00a047\u00a0%).  Furthermore, the results of our investigation revealed a significant correlation between the existence of the Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphism and an increased vulnerability to the development of PCOS and infertility. Consistent with our findings, prior research has shown a significant correlation between Cdx2 and heightened susceptibility to PCOS in the Egyptian population [ 9 ]. However, a case-control study in the Indian population revealed a protective relationship between the presence of the Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphism and PCOS [ 24 ]. Other studies on Pakistani women showed a non-significant association between Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphism and PCOS [ 21 ]. A larger sample size of 2041 individuals was used for our meta-analysis, which revealed a substantial association between the Cdx2 polymorphism (rs11568820) in the allele contrast (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.97\u20131.38, p <\u00a00.01), the recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.46, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.04\u20135.87, p <\u00a00.01), the dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.76\u20131.16, p <\u00a00.01), the over dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.69, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55\u20130.86, p <\u00a00.01), the CC vs. cc model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.69, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.55\u20130.86, p <\u00a00.01), and the CC vs. Cc model (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.01, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.34\u20136.86, p <\u00a00.01).  The results of the Cdx2 polymorphism show considerable discrepancies. Variations across groups may arise from disparities in genetic backgrounds, including allele frequencies, haplotype configurations, and linkage disequilibrium patterns. Furthermore, dietary habits, BMI, and other environmental variables may alter VDR activity and interact with Cdx2 polymorphism to influence PCOS risk. These factors may include vitamin D status, which is regulated by food consumption, supplementation, and sunshine exposure. These relationships underscore the intricate nature of PCOS as a complex condition. To rectify these discrepancies, further studies are needed for forthcoming investigations that include varied populations and extensive data on confounding variables to clarify the function of Cdx2 polymorphism in the etiology of PCOS.  Moreover, our study's findings demonstrated no significant association between the Fok I (rs22228570) polymorphism and an increased susceptibility to PCOS or infertility. Consistent with our results, a previous meta-analysis by Shi et al. that included 2086 case and control participants reported no link between the Fok I (rs22228570) polymorphism and risk for PCOS [ 10 ]. Similarly, case-control studies conducted in PCOS vs. non-PCOS women in Australia [ 31 ], Poland [ 25 ], India [ 24 ], and Korea [ 17 ] reported comparable results. In our meta-analysis, a total of 3705 participants were included. No significant associations were observed for the Fok I (rs22228570) polymorphism across various genetic models: allele contrast (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.91\u20131.112, p =\u00a00.12), recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.90, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.72\u20131.13, p =\u00a00.47), dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.06, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.92\u20131.22, p =\u00a00.29), over-dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.95\u20131.27, p =\u00a00.77), FF vs. ff model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.74\u20131.20, p =\u00a00.32), FF vs. Ff model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u20131.12, p =\u00a00.74).  Meanwhile, the results of our research revealed a substantial association between the Taq I (rs731236) polymorphism and a heightened vulnerability to PCOS or infertility. In contrast with our meta-analysis, previous meta-analyses included 3036 case and control participants and reported no associations between Taq I (rs731236) polymorphism and PCOS in women [ 11 ]. Thirteen case\u2013control studies involving 3538 participants reported a significant association between the Taq polymorphism (rs731236) in the allele contrast (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.25, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.13\u20131.39, p <\u00a00.01), the recessive model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.50, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.22\u20131.85, p <\u00a00.01), the dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.41, p <\u00a00.01) and the TT vs. tt model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.59, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26\u20132.00, P <\u00a00.01), however there was no significant association in the over dominant model (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.97, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.84\u20131.12, P =\u00a00.09) and the TT vs. Tt model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.43, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.14\u20131.79, p =\u00a00.14).  A subgroup analysis was also undertaken to investigate the possible significance of patient BMI and ethnicity on the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of PCOS. Significant associations were found for specific polymorphisms within certain subgroups, suggesting that both BMI and ethnicity may play a role in modifying these associations. For instance, the analysis of the Apa I (rs7975232) polymorphism in overweight and obese individuals revealed a significant association in the allele contrast model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20131.39, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Similarly, analysis of the Bsm I (rs1544410) polymorphism showed significant associations in Asians for the allele contrast model (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.49, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). This finding could be explained by genetic differences between ethnic groupings. Furthermore, due to the procedure of natural selection, functional variations in various groups may differ [ 35 ].  While Egger's tests generally indicated an absence of publication bias, some asymmetry was observed in the funnel plots for specific genetic models, suggesting potential publication bias. For instance, in the Bsm I (rs1544410) polymorphism, there is noticeable asymmetry in the allele contrast (B vs. b) and the recessive model (BB vs. Bb\u00a0+\u00a0bb). This suggests that studies with smaller sample sizes and less significant results might be underrepresented. However, it is crucial to recognize that funnel plot asymmetry does not definitively prove publication bias. Other factors, such as heterogeneity between studies or true differences in effect size across studies with varying sample sizes, could also contribute to the observed asymmetry. Further investigation and careful interpretation are necessary to determine the extent of publication bias in these cases.  The present systematic review and meta-analysis give important information regarding the association of VDR gene polymorphisms with PCOS. However, confounding factors, such as those not discussed broadly in the involved studies, may have an effect on the results. Important among the modulators of VDR activity that may interact with VDR gene polymorphisms to affect PCOS susceptibility include circulating vitamin D level, dietary habits, sun exposure, and body mass index. As an example, vitamin D status might impact immune and endocrine functions controlled by VDR [ 36 ]. Vitamin D executes its critical function in immune and endocrine modalities through its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)\u2082D\u2083), via the vitamin D receptor VDR [ 37 ]. This modulation has a vital role in the health of the immune system and a wide implication in diseases. VDR is highly expressed on numerous significant immune cells of the immune system, which include B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [ [37] , [38] , [39] ]. These cells can, amongst other functions, locally convert vitamin D into its active form, which may be of great importance for the modulation of immune responses [ 40 ]. Vitamin D strengthens innate immunity by enhancing the production of antimicrobial peptides and supports adaptive immunity by modulating T cell responses. Thus, it hinders inflammatory TH cells and enhances Treg cells, being important for the prevention of autoimmunity [ 37 , 39 ]. Anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D signaling via VDR include a decrease in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and induction of immune tolerance [ 37 , 40 ]. Being a nuclear receptor, VDR controls the expression of more than 900 genes, covering a wide range of physiological processes, including immune and endocrine functions [ 36 , 41 ]. Besides its well-documented role in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, vitamin D exerts an impact on other endocrine systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of health and prevention of diseases [ 38 ]. Vitamin D, via interaction with VDR, may play an important role in immune and endocrine functions [ 36 , 39 ]. It keeps the balance of immune homeostasis through a potent enhancement of antimicrobial defense and modulation of inflammatory responses and is involved in endocrine health [ 37 , 41 ]. A fair level of the vitamin is needed to prevent many diseases or for normal health conditions [ 41 ].  Several studies have found the influence of VDR polymorphisms on insulin resistance in the background of PCOS. Thus, for instance, the Cdx2 genotype is associated with better insulin sensitivity; 'AA' genotype carriers are characterized by decreased levels of fasting insulin and better indices of insulin sensitivity in the group of women with PCOS [ 42 , 43 ]. There is also a meaningful influence of Taq I polymorphism on insulin resistance in PCOS, particularly detected in some ethnic groups [ 43 , 44 ]. Insulin resistance in the background of PCOS partially depends on increased serine phosphorylation of an insulin receptor that influences insulin signaling pathways. Such a defect is probably dependent on the modulation of VDR polymorphism that may influence insulin receptor signaling pathways and contribute to the metabolic phenotype of PCOS [ 45 ]. Less evident is the direct link between VDR polymorphisms and disturbances in anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone regulation in PCOS. However, because VDR participates in more general regulation of steroidogenesis, the indirect impact should be considered. Thus, VDR polymorphisms have been associated with altered levels of testosterone, which might influence AMH production and ovarian function [ 42 ]. The effect of VDR polymorphisms on PCOS varies among ethnic groups, where some variants were found to be strongly associated in Asians and Caucasians. This variability likely hints at much-needed research in diverse populations to finally clarify the genetic mystery behind PCOS [ 43 ].  Although the present meta-analysis throws some light on the correlation between VDR gene polymorphisms and PCOS, several limitations must be pointed out. Most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were region-specific, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Most of the studies were conducted in countries like Egypt, Poland, Brazil, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, China, and Australia. More global representation will give an edge in terms of wider applicability. Moreover, confounding variables such as circulating levels of vitamin D, dietary habits, sun exposure, and body mass index, which are significant modifiers of VDR activity, have not been properly addressed in the subjects studied. We recommend that future studies consider these factors to provide a better mechanistic understanding of VDR polymorphisms in PCOS. Current results are from relatively small sample sizes, thus emphasizing the need for further, larger, and more diverse studies. We strongly recommend GWAS for the identification of other genetic markers and also to study the interplay between genetic and environmental factors involved in the manifestation of PCOS.    5  Conclusion  This systematic review and meta-analysis provide essential information on the association of VDR gene polymorphisms with PCOS in women. It was particularly noted that women with Apa I, Bsm I, Cdx2, and Taq I polymorphisms of the VDR gene may be more susceptible to developing PCOS. It should be noted that the Fok I polymorphism does not risk PCOS. Moreover, several limitations have been noted regarding region-specific studies, a lack of global representation, and a number of subjects in primary studies. Clearly, confounding factors like serum levels of vitamin D, dietary habits, exposure to sunlight, or body mass index may influence the activity of VDR significantly. Future study should acknowledge noted limitations, focusing on the interplay between genetics and environmental factors in the expression of PCOS. Consequently, more multicentric investigations with higher sample sizes are necessary to validate the observed associations, and genome-wide association investigations (GWAS) would significantly enhance the results.
