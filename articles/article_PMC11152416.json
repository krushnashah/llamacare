    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is a homodimeric glycoprotein from the\ntransforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily secreted by granulosa cells from\nprimary to large antral follicles ( Desforges-Bullet et al. , 2010 ; Mashiach et al. , 2010 ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ). It is suggested that AMH plays\nan important role in the regulation of early follicle growth, with an inhibiting\neffect on growing follicles ( Mashiach et\nal. , 2010 ), and suppressing the cyclical recruitment of\nprimordial follicles ( Tal et al. ,\n2014 ).  AMH serum levels peak around 24 years of age and decline progressively until\nmenopause ( Melado Vidales et al. ,\n2017a ). It is considered a reliable marker of ovarian reserve and a\npredictor of ovarian response to controlled stimulation ( Melado Vidales et al. , 2017a ; Tal et al. , 2014 ). Some\nauthors have suggested a positive correlation between AMH and oocyte quality,\nfertilization rates and embryo morphology ( Borges et al. , 2017 ; La\nMarca et al. , 2011 ; Morales et al. , 2022 ).  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine condition that affects 5-8% of women\nof reproductive age worldwide ( Desforges-Bullet et al. , 2010 ; Kaya et al. , 2010 ). It is the most common cause of\nanovulatory infertility, and it is associated with high levels of AMH, which is a\nconsequence, not only related to the higher number of preantral and small antral\nfollicles, but also to an increased production by individual follicles ( Kaya et al. , 2010 ; Tal et al. , 2014 ).  In PCOS patients, the selection of one follicle from the increased follicular pool\nand its posterior dominance is impaired. The mechanisms underlying this process are\nstill uncertain, but inhibition of the local effect of follicle-stimulating hormone\n(FSH) seems to play an important role. AMH inhibits the initiation of primordial\nfollicle growth by reducing the sensitivity of follicles to FSH, thus preventing the\nselection of multiple follicles ( Arabzadeh et\nal. , 2010 ). Thus, some studies have suggested that AMH plays\nan important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Serum AMH levels also appears to\nbe related to the severity of PCOS and ovarian dysfunction, correlating with de\ndegree of hyperandrogenism, ovulation disorder and polycystic ovary morphology\n( Tal et al. , 2014 ).  Although some studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between AMH levels and\nqualitative aspects of assisted reproduction treatment, it is known that PCOS\npatients may have worse maturation and fertilization rates compared to\nnormo-ovulatory women ( Fallat et\nal. , 1997 ; La Marca et\nal. , 2011 ; Mashiach et al. , 2010 ). The follicular microenvironment is\nalso likely to be related to the success or failure of developmental competence of\noocytes and embryos ( Mashiach et\nal. , 2010 ). Fallat et\nal . (1997) demonstrated that women with PCOS had higher\nfollicular fluid AMH levels, a higher percentage of immature oocytes, and lower\nfertilization rates when compared to women with endometriosis and pelvic\nadhesions.  It is still controversial whether high levels of both serum and follicular fluid AMH\nin PCOS patients can correlate well with in vitro fertilization\noutcomes such as oocyte quality, fertilization rates and pregnancy rates or if AMH\nlevels are restricted to the prediction of ovarian reserve in these patients. Thus,\nthe aim of the present study is to perform a literature review regarding the\nassociation between the high levels of AMH and IVF outcomes in this specific\npopulation.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  We ran a literature review according to the PRISMA guideline (Preferred Reporting\nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) to evaluate the study question. To\nidentify the relevant studies, we searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library\ndatabases, with the last search made in January 2023 and no restriction regarding\nlanguage or year of publication. Bibliographies of relevant studies identified by\nthe search strategy and relevant reviews/meta-analyses were also searched for\nidentification of additional studies. We retrieved the relevant articles using the\nsearch strategies described below:  MEDLINE: (((antimullerian hormone) AND (oocyte quality)) AND (embryo quality)) AND\n(polycystic ovary syndrome)  Cochrane Library: antimullerian hormone AND oocyte quality AND embryo quality AND\npolycystic ovary syndrome  The selection of manuscripts, as well as the evaluation of titles and abstracts, were\nconducted by two blinded researchers (L.C.D. and C.R.I) working independently. After\nthis initial screening, the remaining articles were further evaluated to be included\nor not in the review.    RESULTS  The search process to identify and select the studies is presented in Figure 1 . We found a total of 31 studies, of\nwhich 12 studies were included in the final review. Eighteen studies were excluded\nafter an initial screening based on the titles. Four other studies were excluded\nafter abstract reading for not individualizing patients with PCOS. Two other studies\nwere excluded after full text reading because they were written in Chinese and no\nEnglish text version could be retrieved. Five more studies were included after we\nsearched the References of the studies already included. Table 1 summarizes the studies included in the review.

AMH on hCG trigger day was correlated with top\nquality embryos.       Figure 1 Flowchart of the studies included.    Most of the studies were prospective, while only one was a retrospective cohort\nstudy. Eight of the twelve studies reported the follicular fluid levels of AMH (FF\nAMH). Seven of these eight studies compared PCOS patients with control\nnormo-ovulatory patients. Five of them reported higher FF AMH in PCOS patients,\nwhile one study found lower FF AMH in PCOS patients, and another study did not find\ndifferences in FF AMH ( Arabzadeh et\nal. , 2010 ; Chen et\nal ., 2017 ; Fallat et\nal. , 1997 ; Mashiach et al. , 2010 ; Melado\nVidales et al. , 2017b ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Yilmaz et al. , 2012 ).  Seven studies reported the number of oocytes retrieved ( Arabzadeh et al. , 2010 ; Chen et al. , 2017 ; Fallat et al. , 1997 ; Mashiach et al. , 2010 ; Melado Vidales et al. , 2017a ; Yilmaz et al. , 2012 , Xi et al. , 2012 ). Fallat et al. (1997) found a\nhigher number of immature oocytes in PCOS patients compared to patients with tubal\nfactor infertility and endometriosis. Overall, there is a positive correlation\nbetween AMH levels and the number of oocytes retrieved in all patients, but not\nnecessarily for the number of mature oocytes ( Fallat et al. , 1997 ). Mashiach et al . (2010) found no correlation between FF\nAMH and oocyte maturation in PCOS patients compared to controls. Arabzadeh et al. (2010) showed\nthat higher AMH levels were associated with higher oocyte yield, but a positive\nrelationship between serum AMH levels and mature oocytes was observed only in the\nnon-PCOS group. Chen et al. also reported a lower oocyte maturation\nrate in PCOS patients ( Chen et al. ,\n2017 ).  Eight studies analyzed fertilization rates (FR), five of them comparing PCOS patients\nto normo-ovulatory patients, while the remaining three studies addressed PCOS\npatients only ( Chen et al. ,\n2017 ; Fallat et al. ,\n1997 ; Kaya et al. ,\n2010 ; Mashiach et al. ,\n2010 ; Melado Vidales et\nal. , 2017b ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Yilmaz et al. , 2012 ; Xi et al. , 2012 ). Fallat et al. (1997) were the only authors that found\nsignificantly lower fertilization rates in PCOS patients compared to controls. Pabuccu et al. (2009) showed\nthat in PCOS patients the FR increased with higher FF AMH levels but did not\ncorrelate with serum AMH levels. Kaya et\nal. (2010) on the other hand, demonstrated a progressive\nincrease in FR with higher serum AMH concentrations.  Five studies addressed the embryo quality and only one of them found PCOS patients\nhad lower rates of high-quality embryos ( Chen et al. , 2017 ; Mashiach et al. , 2010 ; Melado Vidales et al. , 2017a ; 2017b; Xi et al. , 2012 ). Melado Vidales et al. (2017a) demonstrated serum AMH levels on hCG trigger day were correlated with the number of\ntop-quality embryos obtained in all the patients studied. The same authors, however,\nfound no significant between-group differences for AMH levels in FF nor for FR,\nnumber of TQE or implantation rates when comparing PCOS patients to patients with\nlow/normal ovarian reserve ( Melado Vidales et al. , 2017b ).  Six studies reported implantation rates (IR) and the results were discrepant ( Arabzadeh et al. , 2010 ; Chen et al. , 2017 ; Kaya et al. , 2010 ; Melado Vidales et al. , 2017b ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Xi et al. , 2012 ). The\ntwo studies that compared PCOS patients with normo-ovulatory controls did not find\nsignificant differences in IR between groups ( Chen et al. , 2017 ; Melado\nVidales et al. , 2017b ). Of the studies that addressed\nonly PCOS patients, Pabuccu et al .\n(2009) found IR were markedly increased with higher follicular-fluid AMH\nbut not among the different serum AMH concentration groups. On the other hand, Kaya et al. (2010) showed IR\nincreased progressively with the increase in day-3 AMH serum concentrations while Xi et al . (2012) found\nlower IR with higher serum AMH levels.  Clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) were reported in five of the twelve studies ( Chen et al. , 2017 ; Kaya et al. , 2010 ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Tal et al. , 2014 ; Xi et al. , 2012 ). Only one of\nthem compared PCOS patients with normo-ovulatory controls and found similar rates,\nalthough the FF AMH levels were markedly higher in PCOS patients ( Chen et al. , 2017 ). Xi et al. (2012) and Kaya et al. (2010) studied\nonly PCOS patients and showed conflicting data. While the first group of authors\nfound CPR were lower in patients with higher serum AMH levels, the former\ndemonstrated the opposite. Pabuccu et\nal. (2009) on the other hand, showed a positive correlation\nbetween CPR and FF AMH, but not serum AMH concentrations. A retrospective cohort\nstudy evaluated patients with serum AMH levels higher than 10 ng/mL and demonstrated\na 97% prevalence of PCOS in this population. Moreover, these patients had a\nsignificantly higher CPR compared with patients who have AMH levels between 5 and 10\nng/mL ( Tal et al. ,\n2014 ).    DISCUSSION  The present study consisted of a scoping review that evaluated the association\nbetween AMH levels and IVF outcomes in women with infertility and PCOS. Our study\nshowed that AMH levels in both serum and FF are higher in PCOS patients compared to\nwomen with other infertility factors. Regarding the laboratorial and pregnancy\noutcomes in IVF treatment, the studies analyzed were unanimous in concluding that\nPCOS women have a higher oocyte yield; however, whether this translates into better\nmaturation, fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancies, and live birth rates\nis still controversial.  AMH is a well-known marker of ovarian reserve and has been proven to be positively\nassociated with ovarian response in controlled stimulation and, therefore, oocyte\nyield ( Brodin et al. , 2013 ).\nIn PCOS the serum AMH levels are up to 5-fold higher than in normo-ovulatory women\n( Xi et al. , 2012 ),\nmainly due to an increased in AMH production by each individual follicle rather than\na higher number of follicles ( Fanchin et\nal. , 2005 ). In the past years, some studies have analyzed\nthe AMH levels in follicular fluid during oocyte pickup (OPU) after controlled\novarian stimulation. As expected, most of them showed higher levels in PCOS patients\n( Arabzadeh et al. , 2010 ; Chen et al. , 2017 ; Fallat et al. , 1997 ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Yilmaz et al. , 2012 ). Mashiach et al. (2010) found\nlower mean levels of AMH in FF of PCOS patients compared to normo-ovulatory\ncontrols; and Melado Vidales et al. (2017b) found no between-group differences when comparing PCOS women to\npatients with low and normal ovarian reserve. It is worth noting, though, that both\nstudies are limited by small sample sizes. The AMH production by granulosa cells\ndecreases during oocyte maturation, and the development of small antral follicles\ninto mature follicles during controlled ovarian stimulation is associated with a\ndramatic decrease in serum AMH levels. Fanchin et al. (2005) demonstrated that FF AMH levels were 3\ntimes higher in follicles 8-12mm than 16-20mm and these levels were positively\nassociated with AFC and oocyte yield.  PCOS patients have a higher number of oocytes collected after OPU, but this does not\nnecessarily translate into a higher number of mature oocytes. Fallat et al. (1997) demonstrated that immature\noocytes rate was higher in PCOS patients and Arabzadeh et al . (2010) found that, although the serum\nand FF AMH levels were higher in PCOS compared to normo-ovulatory controls, the\npositive correlation between AMH concentrations and mature oocytes was fund only in\nthe control group. A prospective study by Ebner et al. (2006) divided patients according to their\nAMH serum levels and found that serum AMH <1.66ng/mL and >4.52ng/mL were\nassociated with oocytes of lower quality. The study included patients undergoing\nICSI, most of them for male factor infertility and did not address PCOS patients\nspecifically. However, AMH levels higher than 5ng/mL are commonly associated with\nPCOS, so it is possible that part of the cohort of patients had the syndrome.  PCOS is characterized by an abnormal folliculogenesis and failure in selecting a\ndominant follicle, which is reflected by high levels of AMH ( Desforges-Bullet et al. , 2010 ). It is known\nthat AMH has an inhibitory effect on FSH-induced aromatase expression in granulosa\ncells ( Tal et al. , 2014 ; Xi et al. , 2012 ). This\nreduces the follicle sensibility to FSH, which could lead to impaired oocyte\nmaturation during controlled ovarian stimulation. Indeed, Desforges-Bullet et al. (2010) found lower FF\nFSH levels in PCOS patients compared to controls and, although the clinical\npregnancy rates were similar between the groups, FF AMH was lower in patients who\nwere pregnant. It is not clear whether the deleterious effect AMH has on FSH\nfunction could impact on fertilization rates. Chen et al. (2017) observed higher AMH levels on both\nserum and follicular fluid of PCOS patients compared to male and tubal factor\ninfertility, and found no differences in fertilization rates. However, the oocyte\nmaturation and top-quality embryo rates were significantly lower in PCOS patients\n( Chen et al. , 2017 ). Fallat et al. (1997) showed the percentage of immature oocytes retrieved in PCOS were significantly\nhigher, and the fertilization rates were significantly lower compared to patients\nwith tubal factor infertility and endometriosis. On the other hand, Kaya et al. (2010) analyzed\nonly PCOS patients and demonstrated a positive correlation between AMH levels and\nthe number of mature oocytes, fertilization, implantation, and clinical pregnancy\nrates. All studies are limited by a small sample size and do not consider the\ndifferent PCOS phenotypes.  One of the many factors limiting the clinical pregnancy rates after assisted\nreproductive treatments is the embryo quality. The disruption in folliculogenesis\nobserved in PCOS patients leads to lower fertilization and cleavage rates in this\npopulation, and could potentially impair embryo quality and, thus, pregnancy rates\n( Mashiach et al. , 2010 ).\nWhile Mashiach et al. (2010) found that in PCOS patients the FF AMH was related to lower top-quality embryos\ncompared to controls. Xi et al. (2012) did not report differences on embryo quality when separating PCOS\npatients by the serum AMH levels. Though the studies evaluated AMH concentrations in\ndifferent fluids, it is already known that both are elevated in women with PCOS\ncompared to normo-ovulatory women ( Mashiach et al. , 2010 ; Pabuccu et al. , 2009 ; Xi et al. , 2012 ). Chen et al . (2017) reported a smaller number of\ntop-quality embryos in PCOS patients when compared to patients with tubal and male\nfactor infertility, and higher levels of FF AMH. Despite the lower number of\ntop-quality embryos in PCOS patients, the implantation and pregnancy rates were\nsimilar in all groups. Notwithstanding, the authors did not disclose the number of\nembryos available for transfer in each group. It is possible that PCOS patients have\na higher number of embryos, and this could overcome the embryo quality problem.\nMoreover, all control patients received a fresh embryo transfer, while some of the\nPCOS patients had a frozen embryo transfer due to the high risk of ovarian\nhyperstimulation syndrome. Ciepiela et\nal. (2019) analyzed data from women with several infertility\nfactors undergoing ICSI treatment, and found that FF AMH was higher, and FF FSH was\nlower in follicles in which the oocyte developed into a top-embryo quality. Whether\nthis association remains true for exclusively PCOS patients remains elusive. As\nalready demonstrated by Melado Vidales et\nal. (2017a ; 2017b), serum AMH on hCG trigger day in PCOS\npatients was associated to embryo quality and not FF AMH. Notwithstanding, the\nstudies are limited by their small sample sizes ( Melado Vidales et al. , 2017a ; 2017b).  CPR and live birth rates are the most valuable outcomes for patients undergoing\nassisted reproductive treatment. La Marca et\nal. (2011) have already assessed the use of AMH in a model\nto predict live birth rates in women undergoing IVF treatment. They found\nstatistically significant lower odds of live birth for increasing age and decreasing\nAMH ( La Marca et al. , 2011 ).\nThe study participants were included regardless of infertility factor, and there was\nno subgroup analysis for PCOS women. Tal et\nal. (2014) analyzed infertile patients with serum AMH levels\nhigher than 5ng/mL and found that ultrahigh levels (> 10ng/mL) could predict PCOS\nwith 97% accuracy. Women with AMH >10 ng/mL had higher rates of ovarian\nhyperstimulation syndrome and CPR compared with women with AMH 5-10 ng/mL. Also,\nwomen with higher AMH levels have more frequency of oligomenorrhea and polycystic\novary morphology. Serum AMH correlated positively with LH, total testosterone, DHEAS\nlevels and showed strong predictive ability for the presence of amenorrhea ( Tal et al. , 2014 ). It is\npossible that the AMH concentrations reflect the severity of PCOS. As already\ndemonstrated, higher levels in serum and follicular fluid are associated with lower\noocyte maturity rates in some studies ( Arabzadeh et al. , 2010 ; Ebner et al. , 2006 ; Fallat et al. , 1997 ). This maturation impairment is not\nnecessarily associated with lower clinical pregnancy rates, as demonstrated by\nPabbucu et al. (2009) and Kaya et al. (2010) showing higher pregnancy rates as FF\nAMH and serum AMH increased, respectively. On the other hand, Xi et al . (2012) reported lower CPR in PCOS\npatients with serum AMH levels >8.82ng/mL. This difference, however, was only\nclose to statistical significance and the study sample size is small to draw any\ndefinitive conclusion ( Xi et al. ,\n2012 ). Chen et al. (2017) also found no differences in CPR when comparing PCOS patients with\ntubal and male factor infertility. The numbers of mature oocytes and top-quality\nembryos were, however, lower in PCOS patients, with a median serum and FF AMH\nhigher.  All studies that compared PCOS patients to normo-ovulatory controls unanimously\nconcluded that oocyte retrieval is higher in the first group. Although the oocyte\nmaturation and fertilization rates can differ between patients, leading to lower\ntop-quality embryos, CPR were not affected by laboratorial outcomes. One possible\nexplanation for the impaired oocyte maturation and embryo development is that the\nhigher AMH levels reflect more severe PCOS characteristics, such as worse metabolic\nfeatures and hyperandrogenism. Patients with higher AMH levels may also have higher\nLH levels, which can result in higher intrafollicular hyperandrogenism, leading to\nimpaired oocyte development and, therefore, affect embryo quality. The inhibitory\neffect AMH has on FSH-induced aromatase expression in granulosa cells may also be\nresponsible for lower follicular sensibility to FSH and worse ovarian stimulation\noutcomes.  It is widely known that in assisted reproduction, the more oocytes a patient has, the\nbetter odds of getting a pregnancy. The higher levels and both serum and follicular\nfluid AMH levels can have a deleterious impact on laboratorial features, but it is\npossible that the higher oocyte numbers are able to overcome these disadvantages.\nTherefore, although AMH concentrations can predict worse features of PCOS, it can\nalso be a marker of higher oocyte yield. Whether the different phenotypes and\nseverity of PCOS could have a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes after assisted\nreproduction is a matter for further studies.    CONCLUSION  This review summarized the available evidence on AMH levels and reproductive outcomes\nin PCOS infertile women. We concluded that women with PCOS have higher serum and\nfollicular fluid AMH levels, and it is a predictor of higher oocyte yield. However,\noocyte and embryo quality are usually worse in these patients. The pregnancy rates\nare not affected by laboratorial outcomes, which shows that higher oocyte number can\novercome the embryo quality problem. Moreover, AMH levels concentration can predict\nworse features of PCOS.",

Arabzadeh et al .,\n2010   Prospective  To compare the relationship between serum or\nintrafollicular AMH levels and IVF outcomes in women with and\nwithout PCOS.  26 women with PCOS and 42 normo-ovulatory\ncontrols  68  Median serum basal AMH and FF AMH levels were\nsignificantly higher in the PCOS group as compared to controls. In\nboth groups, serum basal AMH levels showed a positive correlation\nwith number of oocytes retrieved. In the control group, there was a\npositive relationship between serum basal AMH levels and percentage\nof matured oocytes and implantation rate.     Kaya et al .,\n2010   Prospective clinical trial  To determine the possible relationship between serum\nAMH concentrations on day 3 and controlled ovarian stimulation and\nreproductive outcomes in women with PCOS.  Patients with PCOS and infertility  60  The CPR, IR and FR increased progressively with the\nincrease in day-3 AMH serum concentrations.     Xi et al. ,\n2012   Prospective cohort  To investigate if day 3 serum AMH\nconcentrations day 3 could predict controlled ovarian\nstimulation and reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS.  PCOS patients undergoing their first IVF cycle  164  E2 levels on trigger day and oocytes retrieved\nsignificantly increased with increasing AMH levels. Implantation\nrate and clinical pregnancy rate were lower in the higher AMH group.\nFR and number of good quality embryos were comparable between\ngroups.     Yilmaz et al .,\n2012   Prospective sequential cross sectional study  To investigate the follicular fluid concentrations of\nAMH and its effect on assisted reproductive technology outcome in\nnon-obese, non-hyperandrogenomic PCOS patients  Primary infertile patients with PCOS (16), male\nfactor (19) and unexplained infertility (19)  54  FF AMH levels were higher in patients with PCOS but\ndid not reach statistical significance. FF AMH was positively\ncorrelated with oocyte, 2PN and embryo number. FF AMH levels weren\u2019t\ndifferent between the groups who were pregnant or not.    Tal et al. , 2014  Retrospective cohort study  Characterize a population of women with elevated AMH\n(>5ng/mL).  Women with serum AMH > 5ng/mL  134  Greater than 97% of women with ultrahigh AMH (>10\nng/mL) had PCOS and also greater prevalence of PCOM and\noligomenorrhea. Serum AMH correlated positively with LH, total\ntestosterone, DHEAS and showed strong predictive ability for the\npresence of amenorrhea. Women with AMH >10 ng/mL showed higher\nrates of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and clinical pregnancy\nrates compared with women with AMH 5-10 ng/mL.    Chen et al. , 2017  Prospective study  Evaluate associations between basal serum and FF AMH\nlevels and IVF outcomes in PCOS patients.  Infertile patients with PCOS (59), tubal and male\nfactor (120)  179  Median serum and FF AMH level was higher in PCOS\npatients than in controls. Oocyte maturation and high-quality embryo\nrates were lower in PCOS patients than in controls, but both groups\nhad similar fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and\nnewborn rates. Peak E2 and FF AMH levels were independent predictors\nof oocyte number.     Melado Vidales et\nal ., 2017b   Prospective observational cohort study  To assess the correlation between COH outcome\nparameters and AMH serum levels during IVF treatment in women with\nvarying ovarian reserve levels.  Infertile patients undergoing IVF with low\n(11)/normal (16) ovarian reserve and PCOS (19).  46  AMH was significant correlated with AFC, number of\nfollicles >11mm on hCG trigger day, number of oocytes retrieved\nand MII oocytes. AMH on hCG trigger day was correlated with top\nquality embryos."
