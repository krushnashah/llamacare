    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), initially described in 1935 by Stein and Leventhal,\nis the most common endocrine disorder among females, affecting approximately 5%-20%\nof women in their reproductive age, depending on the criteria used ( He et al ., 2015 ; Asemi et al ., 2015 ; Firouzabadi et al ., 2012 ). In\nIran, the prevalence of PCOS has been reported to be about 15% ( Mehrabian et al ., 2011 ). PCOS\nis a heterogeneous androgen excess disorder with different degrees of reproductive\nand metabolic dysfunctions ( He et\nal ., 2015 ), and it is characterized by hyperandrogenism,\nmenstrual disorder and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound ( Firouzabadi et al ., 2012 ). Increased serum\ninsulin levels, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia are common\namong patients with PCOS ( He et al .,\n2015 ).  A relatively higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (50% to 70%) is found among\nwomen with PCOS ( Legro et al .,\n2004 ) compared to a prevalence of 20%-48% among the general adult\npopulation ( He et al ., 2015 ; Forrest & Stuhldreher, 2011 ; Hovsepian et al ., 2011 ; Tangpricha et al ., 2002 ). New\nstudies have indicated a possible role for vitamin D in insulin secretion, as well\nas insulin resistance ( He et al .,\n2015 ; Krul-Poel et al .,\n2013 ). Vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the pathogenesis of\nmetabolic syndrome by increasing insulin synthesis and release, as well as insulin\nreceptor expression ( He et al .,\n2015 ; Ardabili et al .,\n2012 ). Insufficient vitamin D also disturbs extracellular and\nintracellular calcium balance, which may result in peripheral insulin resistance\n( Ardabili et al ., 2012 ; Pittas et al ., 2007 ; Jorde & Figenschau, 2009 ). Vitamin D\ndeficiency is also followed by increased renin-angiotensin II expression, which\nmight affect insulin resistance ( Rammos et\nal ., 2008 ).  Some previous studies have suggested that lower vitamin D levels might increase the\nrisk of insulin resistance and metabolic disorder in women with PCOS, but their\nresults are not conclusive ( He et\nal ., 2015 ; Verdoia et\nal ., 2014 ; Wehr et\nal ., 2009 ). Therefore, the objective of the present study\nwas to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance among\nIranian women with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  The present study was a non-controlled trial involving the pre and post treatment of\nwomen in the Taleghani Hospital Tehran, Iran from May 2015 to September 2015. Women\nbetween 20 and 40 years of age, with established PCOS based on the Rotterdam\ncriteria, who also had vitamin D deficiency, entered the study. The ethics committee\nof the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, approved the\nstudy and all participants gave their written consent before entering the study. The\npresent study complied with the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki. We also\nregistered our study in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the\nregistration number IRCT2014100619426N1. The exclusion criteria included Cushing's\nsyndrome, adrenal hyperplasia, alcoholism, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism,\nDiabetes Mellitus, androgen secreting tumors, pregnancy, lactation, and any systemic\ndisorder, which can influence vitamin D levels, including malabsorption syndrome as\nwell as liver and kidney diseases. Patients with a past of using drugs, which might\naffect the levels of vitamin D, such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation,\nantiepileptic drugs, oral hypoglycemic drugs and glucocorticoids, were excluded from\nthe study.  A questionnaire which included height, weight, body mass index, history of\ninfertility and menstrual status was filled for all participants before the start of\nthe study and also 2 months post treatment with vitamin D. Fasting glucose, fasting\ninsulin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels were measured in all patients\nusing a morning blood sample which was taken after a 12-hour overnight fast. We used\na chemiluminescence immunoassay system to determine the serum insulin levels\n(Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA) and 25 (OH) D (DiaSorin SpA, Saluggia, Italy). The\nserum glucose levels were measured using a spectrophotometric method. All\nparticipants were then given a single dose of vitamin D (300,000 units)\nintramuscular and all tests were repeated again two months post treatment in the\nsame manner. In addition, we calculated the glucose resistance index for all\nparticipants pretreatment and two months post-treatment. Insulin resistance was\nmeasured using the HOMA-IR method ( Ardabili et al ., 2012 ). The patients were advised to avoid\ntaking vitamin D or calcium supplements during the study. The body mass index was\ncalculated by weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters\n(kg/m 2 ).   Statistical Methods  The normality of the response variables (vitamin D, fasting blood sugar, insulin,\ninsulin resistance, insulin sensitivity index) was checked using the Kolmogorov\nSmirnov formula and the paired t-test was used to compare pre and post treatment\nreadings if normality was established. For adjusting the effects of possible\nconfounding parameters (age, Body Mass Index - BMI, initial vitamin D level) we\nrepeated the measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) if data had normal\ndistribution, and non-parametric tests, like the Wilcoxon test, were used if the\ndata did not have normal distribution. All statistical tests were performed\nusing the SPSS software version 24 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). p -values below 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.  Sample size calculation was performed using these parameters: given a type I\nerror of 0.05 and power of 80% with effect size of 1.5 points change in the\nHOMA-IR based on the study by Ardabili et\nal. (2012) a sample size of 38 was calculated. We\nentered 41 patients to cover for probable patients lost on follow up.     RESULTS  In total 41 patients with a mean age of 26.6\u00b14.1 entered the study. All\npatients completed the study and no patient was lost on follow up. The minimum age\nwas 20 and the maximum age was 36 years. The mean duration of infertility was\n4.1\u00b13.2 years and the mean weight and height were 67\u00b112 kilograms and\n161\u00b15 cm, respectively ( Table 1 ).  The mean BMI was 25.7\u00b14.4. Other demographic findings of participants\nincluding their place of residence, menstruation and hirsutism findings are\nsummarized in Table 2 .

The vitamin D serum level significantly raised from a\npretreatment mean of 5.07\u00b11.77ng/mL to a post-treatment mean of\n16.34\u00b18.99ng/mL ( p <0.001). The mean fasting blood glucose\nreading significantly decreased from 109.56\u00b114.59mg/dL pretreatment to\n103.71\u00b113.72mg/dL post treatment ( p =0.003). There was a\nsignificant decrease in the mean fasting serum insulin, from\n8.52\u00b15.48\u00b5U/mL pretreatment with vitamin D to 7.07\u00b15.03\n\u00b5U/mL post-treatment ( p =0.019). The mean HOMA-IR, as a sign\nof insulin resistance, significantly decreased from 2.37\u00b11.76 to\n1.87\u00b11.49, indicating lower insulin resistance\n( p =0.004).

There are several non-placebo controlled trials of vitamin D treatment on glucose\nmetabolism among women with PCOS, with inconsistent results. In the present study, 1\nintramuscular dose of cholecalciferol (300,000 IU) after 2 months caused significant\nreduction in insulin resistance, as per indicated by HOMA-IR among women with PCOS\nand vitamin D deficiency. Similar to our findings, a study by Selimoglu et\nal . on 11 insulin-resistant women with PCOS, reported that HOMA-IR\nsignificantly decreased three weeks after the administration of a single dose\n(300,000 IU) of cholecalciferol ( Selimoglu et al ., 2010 ). In our study the reduction in glucose\nand insulin levels were both statistically significant; however, Selimoglu et al. , reported a non-significant reduction of glucose and\ninsulin levels among their patients ( Selimoglu et al ., 2010 ). In another study by Wehr et\nal. , fifty-seven PCOS women received 20,000 IU of cholecalciferol\nweekly for 24 weeks ( Wehr et al .,\n2009 ). Anthropometric measures, oral glucose tolerance test, and blood\nanalyses of endocrine parameters were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks and\n24 weeks. They reported a significant decrease of fasting and stimulated glucose\n( p <0.05) and C-peptide levels ( p <0.001)\nafter vitamin D treatment ( Wehr et\nal ., 2009 ). Asemi et al . studied the\neffects of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipid\nconcentrations in overweight and obese vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS ( Asemi et al ., 2015 ). They found\nthat co-supplementation, led to decreased serum insulin levels\n( p =0.03), homeostasis model of assessment of the insulin-resistance\n(HOMA-IR) score ( p =0.04), and a significant rise in the\nquantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) ( p =0.001)\n( Asemi et al ., 2015 ).  In contrast in a study by Pal et al .\n(2012) , twelve overweight and vitamin D deficient women with PCOS\nunderwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing at baseline and following 3 month\nsupplementation with vitamin D (daily dose of 3533 IU, increased to 8533 IU after\nthe first 5 participants) and 530mg elemental Ca daily. They assessed plasma\nglucose, insulin, and insulin-resistance, and reported that the parameters of\nglucose homeostasis and insulin resistance remained unchanged\n( p >0.05). Also Kotsa et\nal . (2009) reported that treatment with alfacalcidol in\npatients with PCOS caused no statistically significant change in insulin\nsensitivity. In another study, Ardabili et al . evaluated the\neffects of vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance in women with PCOS and\nvitamin D deficiency ( Ardabili et\nal ., 2012 ). In their study, the patients received 3 oral\ntreatments consisting of 50,000 IU of vitamin D\u2083 (the case group) or a placebo (1\nevery 20 days) for 2 months. The fasting serum insulin and glucose levels and the\ninsulin sensitivity and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance did not\nshow a significant difference by the end of the study ( Ardabili et al ., 2012 ). Raja-Khan et al . (2014) studied the effects of\nhigh-dose vitamin D on insulin sensitivity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They\nreported that insulin sensitivity was unchanged with high-dose vitamin D, but there\nwas a trend toward decreased 2-hour insulin levels.  Our study had some limitations. We did not use the glucose clamp method ( Ardabili et al ., 2012 ), and we\nused the fasting level for evaluation of insulin sensitivity and secretion. Although\nwe had a relatively small sample size, the significant results found in our study\nshowed that the sample size seemed to be sufficient, and also we did not restrict\nour population to normal BMI, to avoid the confounding effect of weight loss after\ntreatment, but we did not have significant weight loss in our study. Considering the\ncontroversial results of different studies in reducing the insulin resistance among\nPCOS women after supplementation with vitamin D, further experimentation with\ndifferent doses of vitamin D and a longer intervention time are suggested in vitamin\nD-deficient women with PCOS to better support our findings.  In conclusion, it seems that a single injection of vitamin D significantly decreases\nserum insulin levels and insulin resistance among patients with polycystic ovary\nsyndrome.",
