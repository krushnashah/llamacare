    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the main cause of female infertility, affecting 6%\u201320% of women of reproductive age worldwide ( Dumesic et\u00a0al., 2015 ; March et\u00a0al., 2010 ). It is characterized by a wide range of clinical symptoms including hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation and, in many cases, metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes [T2D], hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) ( Boyle and Teede, 2016 ; Dokras et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Despite the detrimental effects on women\u2019s health, progress toward a cure for PCOS has been hindered by the absence of a clear mechanistic etiology, lack of prognostic markers and by the complexity of the disease.  PCOS has a strong heritable component ( Crisosto et\u00a0al., 2007 ; Gorsic et\u00a0al., 2017 , 2019 ), as witnessed by the fact that \u223c60%\u201370% of daughters born to women with PCOS will eventually manifest the disease ( Crisosto et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ). In line with that, daughters of mothers with PCOS have a 5-fold-increased risk of being diagnosed with PCOS later in life ( Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ). An altered in utero milieu, such as excessive androgen ( Abbott et\u00a0al., 2002 ; Franks and Berga, 2012 ; Padmanabhan and Veiga-Lopez, 2013 ; Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Walters et\u00a0al., 2018 ), or elevated levels of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) exposure ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ), may be in part responsible for the development of PCOS. Indeed, recent preclinical evidence demonstrated that PCOS may originate in the womb due to the \u201cprograming\u201d effect of excessive prenatal AMH exposure ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). This animal model, named PAMH, recapitulates all the diagnostic criteria for PCOS in women, including hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, altered fertility, together with increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, which exacerbate the hyperandrogenism in mice ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ) and humans ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Walters et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Preclinical PCOS models provide translatable organisms to investigate the mechanisms underlying the etiology of the disease ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Consistently, prenatally androgenized (PNA) mice derived from dams exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) during late pregnancy, display PCOS-like phenotypes ( Moore et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Roland et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Sullivan and Moenter, 2004 ), which are transmitted across three generations ( Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Environmental factors exert their effects via the induction of epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and these modifications can lead to increased disease susceptibility later in life. However, there are very few studies focusing on the epigenetic changes associated with PCOS development, with only a handful of genome-wide studies conducted so far ( Makrinou et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Shen et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Wang et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Xu et\u00a0al., 2010 , 2016 ; Yu et\u00a0al., 2015 ). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that PCOS neuroendocrine reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions are transmitted in PAMH mice for at least three generations. We employed genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) analysis to characterize methylated genes in ovaries from control and PAMH mice of the third generation, the first unexposed transgenerational offspring, together with transcriptome analysis in these tissues. We identified many genes with altered transcriptome expression in ovarian tissues of PCOS animals and we show that several key molecules associated to the PCOS phenotype are epigenetically regulated through DNA hypomethylation. We report that several differentially methylated signatures found in the ovaries of PCOS-like mice are also present in blood samples from women with PCOS and from daughters born to women with PCOS.  Finally, we provide evidence that treatment of PAMH F3 female offspring with a methylating pharmacological agent rescues the neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations of PCOS, thus highlighting a roadmap to new avenues for epigenetic therapies of the disease.    Results   Prenatal AMH treatment drives transgenerational transmission of reproductive and metabolic PCOS alterations across multiple generations  Given the strong heritability of PCOS and the well-documented transmission of the cardinal neuroendocrine and metabolic features observed in first degree relatives of PCOS women ( Sir-Petermann et\u00a0al., 2002 , 2012 ), we sought to test whether female PCOS-like offspring (F1) of gestating mice prenatally exposed to high AMH (F0) ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ) are susceptible to transfer PCOS-like traits to F2 (intergenerational) and to F3 (transgenerational) offspring.  We injected pregnant dams (F0) intraperitoneally with PBS (CNTR) or with AMH (AMH C , 0.12\u00a0mg/Kg/day; prenatal AMH-treated, PAMH) from embryonic day E16.5 to E18.5, to generate CNTR F1 and PAMH F1, respectively. PAMH F1 females mated with PAMH F1 unrelated males generated PAMH F2 offspring and F2 female offspring mated with another group of unrelated males generated F3 offspring ( Figure\u00a01 A). PAMH F1 female offspring manifest all the major criteria of PCOS diagnosis in\u00a0humans, including hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, increased LH levels, and fertility impairments ( Qi et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). We then assessed whether these neuroendocrine reproductive alterations were systematically present in PAMH F2 and F3 offspring. From postnatal day 30 (P30) to P60, F1, F2, and F3 female PAMH lineage exhibited longer anogenital distance than control offspring ( Figure\u00a01 B), indicating a higher androgenic impregnation in the PAMH lineage. Moreover, PAMH F1-F3 female offspring exhibited delayed vaginal opening and delayed puberty onset ( Figures S1 A and S1B). At P60, the PAMH lineage did not show any difference in body weight as compared with control females ( Figure\u00a0S1 C).

Data in (B)\u2013(E) and (H)\u2013(J) are represented as mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM. For statistical analysis, p values were calculated by Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test (B and G) or by one-way ANOVA followed Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test. \u2217 p\u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.005; \u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0005; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0001.   Subsequently, we uncovered a significant and persistent elevation in both circulating levels of testosterone and LH in adult PAMH F1-F3 females in comparison with the control group ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Ovarian histological analysis of PAMH animals pointed to comparable abnormalities at F1 and F3 consistent with their oligo-ovulatory phenotype, characterized by the presence of fewer post-ovulation corpora lutea as compared with control animals ( Figure\u00a01 E). We confirmed such ovulatory problems by monitoring the estrous cycles of these animals over 3\u00a0weeks and showing that F1, F2, and F3 offspring in the PAMH lineage displayed disrupted estrous cycles with prolonged time spent in metestrus and diestrus as compared with the control offspring ( Figures 1 F and 1G). PAMH lineage also showed diminished fertility and fecundity from F1 to F3, as indicated by fewer pups per litter produced over a 3-month period ( Figure\u00a01 H), by a significant delay in their first litter ( Figure\u00a01 I) and by fewer litters produced during the 90\u00a0days mating protocol ( Figure\u00a01 J). Similar ovulatory and fertility defects were detected when PAMH female offspring were mated with control naive males in a matriline breeding scheme ( Figures S2 A\u2013S2E).  We then checked whether PAMH F1-F3 female offspring presented PCOS-like metabolic alterations. At 6\u00a0months of postnatal life, PAMH F1-F3 animals had higher body weight and fat mass, compared with controls ( Figure\u00a02 A). The percentage of free body fluids was comparable between all groups ( Figure\u00a02 A). In addition, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were lower in 6-month-old PAMH F1 offspring compared with controls ( Figures 2 B and 2C).

Values are represented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM. For statistical analysis, p values were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test (A, body mass), by Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test (A, % fat mass, % lean mass; D) or by an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test (B and E). Statistical significance for all analyses were \u2217 p\u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.005; \u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0005; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0001.   We then measured fasting glucose levels, upon 12-h overnight fasting conditions, in control and PAMH F1 and F3 female offspring. Fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAMH F1 and PAMH F3 animals than in controls ( Figure\u00a02 D), supporting a hyperglycemic phenotype of these animals. In order to investigate whether PAMH mice displayed a T2D-like\u00a0phenotype, we first applied a tissue-clearing technique, iDISCO+ ( Renier et\u00a0al., 2014 ), and whole-organ 3D imaging to determine the 3D distribution of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells and glucagon-producing \u03b1 cells, across the whole pancreas in 6-month-old CNTR and PAMH F1 female mice ( Figure\u00a02 E). Whole-organ immunofluorescence revealed that pancreatic islets of Langerhans were hypertrophic in PCOS-like animals as compared with controls ( Figure\u00a02 E). To determine whether the islet hyperplasia, observed in PCOS-like animals, was associated with altered insulin secretion, we then measured fasting insulin levels in 6-month-old CNTR and PAMH F1 mice and demonstrated that they are significantly higher in PAMH F1 female offspring than in control animals ( Figure\u00a02 F).    Prenatal AMH exposure results in altered ovarian transcriptomic profiles in the third-generation offspring  To dissect the molecular mechanisms and the affected gene pathways underlying \u201cfetal reprogramming\u201d of PCOS, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in ovaries dissected from control diestrus offspring (CNTR) and from PAMH F3 diestrus and performed differential gene expression analysis ( Figures 3 A and S3 ; Data S1 ). We identified 102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 54 downregulated and 48 upregulated; adjusted p \u2264 0.05) in PAMH F3 ovaries compared with control ovaries ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Next, we generated heatmaps showing the expression patterns of the 102 DEGs in control and PAMH F3 offspring ( Figure\u00a0S4 ). Several differentially downregulated genes are involved in regulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and uptake by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) as shown in the STRING protein interaction network ( Figure\u00a03 D). Figure\u00a03 RNA-seq analysis of ovarian tissue in control and F3 PCOS animals points to altered gene expression linked to ovarian and metabolic functions and to inflammatory response (A) Schematic illustration of the experimental design. (B) MA plot of gene expression changes in the PAMH F3 ovaries (n\u00a0= 4) versus control (prenatally PBS-treated; CNTR, n\u00a0= 3) for all experimental conditions. Ovaries were dissected from CNTR or PAMH F3 adult females (P60) at diestrus. The MA plot represents the estimated log 2 fold change as a function of the mean of normalized counts. Significant genes were selected when adjusted p value lower than 0.05. For significant genes, a selection of first gene names according to the adjusted p value is displayed in red for the upregulated genes and blue for the downregulated genes. (C) Pie chart refers to the number of genes upregulated and downregulated when comparing PAMH F3 with CNTR ovaries (p adj \u2264 0.05). (D) STRING protein network analysis of the downregulated genes revealed strong interaction between genes involved in regulating IGF transport and uptake by IGFBPs. (E\u2013H) Functional annotation charts using DAVID performed on the differentially regulated genes either decreased in PAMH F3 versus CNTR (blue, E and F) or increased in PAMH F3 versus CNTR (red, G and H). Significance is indicated as \u2212log10\u00a0p value. (I\u2013L) Histograms significantly show enrichment in the PAMH F3 ovaries versus CNTR of genes involved in the negative regulation of insulin secretion (I), follistatin ( Fst ; J), lipid metabolism (K), and inflammatory response (L). \u2217 p adj < 0.05; \u2217\u2217 p adj < 0.005; \u2217\u2217\u2217 p adj < 0.0005.   To further gain insight into gene function, we performed a gene enrichment analysis with the DEGs using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) functional annotation tool (p \u2264 0.05; Figures 3 E and 3G). The downregulated-genes-associated biological processes in PAMH F3 offspring are involved in DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, negative regulation of phosphorylation, and negative regulation of cell proliferation ( Figure\u00a03 E). We used pathway analyses to identify the significant pathways associated with the DEGs according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ( Figure\u00a03 F). Our analysis revealed that the most affected pathway is the FoxO signaling pathway, which is related to the regulation of cell cycle and control of quiescence of primordial follicles, steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells, apoptosis, and insulin signaling ( Dupont and Scaramuzzi, 2016 ; Richards and Pangas, 2010 ). The upregulated genes in the PAMH lineage are involved in axon guidance, fatty acid biosynthetic process, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) production, and metabolic processes ( Figure\u00a03 G). KEGG pathway analysis showed that the most affected pathway among the upregulated genes is the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, which is involved in folliculogenesis, ovarian\u00a0function, inflammation, glucose, and energy homeostasis ( Dupont and Scaramuzzi, 2016 ; Richards and Pangas, 2010 ) ( Figure\u00a03 H).  Notably, among the upregulated genes, we found some significant enrichment in PAMH F3 offspring of genes involved in the negative regulation of insulin secretion and in the control of folliculogenesis and ovarian steroidogenesis ( Findlay, 1993 ; Poulsen et\u00a0al., 2020 ), such as inhibin b ( Inhbb ) and insulin degrading enzyme ( Ide ) ( Figure\u00a03 I), as well as follistatin ( Fst ; Figure\u00a03 J). Moreover, we identified a significant enrichment in the ovaries of PAMH F3 mice of genes involved in lipid metabolism ( Figure\u00a03 K) and inflammatory response ( Figure\u00a03 L).  The top 20 significant upregulated and downregulated genes by fold-change in PAMH F3 ovaries versus control ovaries are presented in Figure\u00a0S5 . The top upregulated genes in third-generation PCOS-like ovaries are mainly related to ovarian function, insulin metabolic process, inflammation, angiogenesis, cell-cycle progression, and axon guidance ( Figure\u00a0S5 A). The top 20 downregulated genes are mainly linked to epigenetic modifications, such as histone acetylation or methylation, apoptotic process, cell proliferation, and regulation of cell-cycle progression ( Figure\u00a0S5 B). Notably, the expression of 7 genes among the top 20 upregulated ones ( Figure\u00a0S5 A, asterisks) and 1 gene, among the top 20 downregulated ones ( Figure\u00a0S5 B, asterisks), were previously reported to be altered in women with PCOS ( Table S1 ), strengthening the validity of our animal model.  We then validated the RNA-seq results performing qRT-PCR analyses of 6 upregulated genes and 6 downregulated genes related to ovarian function, metabolism, inflammation, axon guidance, and cell migration ( Figures S5 C and S5D), and we found that the expression of those transcripts is in accordance with the RNA-seq data ( Figure\u00a0S4 ; Data S1 ).    Alterations of DNA methylation patterns in ovaries of PAMH mice  Since ancestral prenatal AMH exposure leads to alterations in\u00a0ovarian gene expression in the third generation, we next investigated whether it could modulate the epigenome in PAMH F3\u00a0offspring. We used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (anti-5\u2019methyl-cytosine, 5mC) combined with deep sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to profile the methylomic landscape in control diestrus ovaries (CNTR, prenatally PBS-treated) versus PAMH F3 diestrus ovaries ( Figure\u00a04 A). Figure\u00a04 Preponderance of hypomethylations in the ovarian tissue of F3 PCOS animals compared with controls and biological process of hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes (A) Schematic illustration of the experimental design. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was performed in control ovaries (CNTR n\u00a0= 3, independent samples at diestrus, P60) and PAMH F3 ovaries (n\u00a0= 3, independent samples at diestrus, P60). (B) MA plot of MeDIP-seq reads. The MA plot represents the log 2 fold change as a function of the mean of normalized counts. Log 2 fold change corresponds to shrunk fold change as calculated with the method proposed in Love et\u00a0al. (2014) . Red dots correspond to significantly different hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions in the ovaries of PAMH F3 animals as compared with controls, adjusted p \u2264 0.05. (C) Total number of methylated regions detected as hyper- or hypomethylated after comparing MeDIP-seq data of the two groups (PAMH3 F3 versus CNTR). (D) Functional annotation plot showing the proportion of methylated regions falling into several genomic features. Upstream refers to upstream regulatory regions. These are regions located \u221220/\u22121 kb away from the TSS. Promoter-TSS refers to regions located \u22121 kb/+100\u00a0bp around the TSS and TTS refers to regions located \u2212100\u00a0bp/+1 kb around the TTS. Plots are shown for hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions.

It details the methylation status, the gene expression changes, and gene ontology related either to ovarian function or PCOS and references when it applies. (G and H) Functional enrichment analysis performed by DAVID on the genes associated with hypomethylated regions when comparing PAMH F3 versus CNTR. GO biological processes (top 20 most significant processes) and KEGG pathway are shown. Significance is indicated as \u2212log10\u00a0p value. (I) STRING protein network prediction interaction of proteins associated with glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, insulin response, and insulin receptor binding. (J and K) Functional enrichment analysis performed by DAVID on the genes associated with hypermethylated regions when comparing PAMH F3 versus CNTR. GO biological processes and KEGG pathway are shown. Significance is indicated as \u2212log10\u00a0p value.   We assessed MeDIP efficiency using spike-in controls for unmethylated and methylated DNA regions from Arabidopsis thaliana ( Figure\u00a0S6 A). Principal component analysis, particularly the PC2, indicates an evident separation of CNTR and PAMH F3 groups ( Figure\u00a0S6 B).  We then calculated the differentially methylated windows between the two groups. Applying an adjusted p value \u2264 0.05 returned 185 significant hypermethylated regions and 887 hypomethylated regions in the ovaries of PAMH F3 offspring as compared with control offspring ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Data S2 ), corresponding to 173 exclusively hypermethylated genes and 858 hypomethylated genes.  We defined feature sets spanning sub-typed by location (exon, intergenic, intron, promoter-transcription start site [TSS], and transcription termination site [TTS]) of the hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions ( Figure\u00a04 D). We also observed that the hypermethylated regions are mostly localized in intronic and intergenic regions, whereas hypomethylated regions are mostly found into upstream-promoters and TSS, thereby most likely affecting gene expression.  To determine whether DNA methylation changes might associate with gene expression variations, we looked for overlap between differentially methylated genes with DEGs of PAMH F3 ovaries ( Figure\u00a04 E). We identified four common genes between MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq: roundabout homolog 1 ( Robo-1 ), sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2 ( Sorbs2 ), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( Cdkn1a ), and histidine decarboxylase ( Hdc ) ( Figures 4 E and 4F). They are respectively implicated in Slit/Robo pathway, Notch signaling, inhibition of cell proliferation, and inflammation ( Figure\u00a04 F).  We next performed GO-term enrichment analysis and revealed distinct functional categories for the PAMH-associated gene lists (p \u2264 0.05; Figures 4 G\u20134K). Within the category of biological processes for the hypomethylated genes, chromatin remodeling and chromatin modification, cell cycle, cell differentiation, lipid metabolism, and insulin response are listed in the top related functions (top 20 most significant processes; Figure\u00a04 G). Regarding the KEGG pathways, the hypomethylated genes are enriched with metabolic pathways and T2D ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Genes associated with insulin regulation (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and T2D) are represented in a STRING protein network predicting interactions of those proteins associated with glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, insulin response, and insulin receptor binding ( Figure\u00a04 I). Within the category of GO biological processes for the hypermethylated genes, nervous system development, axons guidance, heart development, transcription, and methylation pathways are listed in the top related functions ( Figure\u00a04 J). KEGG analysis revealed that GABAergic synapse pathway is significantly enriched in the hypermethylated genes ( Figure\u00a04 K). In accordance with these changes, preclinical investigations in PCOS animal models have reported an ovarian hyperinnervation and a potential contribution of the peripheral sympathetic system in the initiation and/or perpetuation of PCOS has been proposed ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2005 ).  Depicting the differentially methylated genes along the chromosomes in a Manhattan plot confirmed a preponderance of hypomethylation in the PAMH F3 samples and indicated that epigenetic changes occur quite homogenously across all chromosomes ( Figure\u00a05 A). Further, we identified significant changes in DNA methylation in the loci of key genes involved in demethylase activities such as ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 ( Tet1 ) and factors responsible for DNA methylation maintenance, such as ubiquitin-like, containing PHD- and RING-finger domains, 1 ( Uhrf1 ), in PAMH F3 ovaries compared with control ovaries ( Figure\u00a05 B). Both the Tet1 and Uhrf1 loci are significantly hypomethylated in the third-generation PCOS-like ovaries compared with controls ( Figure\u00a05 B). Consistent with these findings, we found a higher expression of Tet1 gene in our RNA-seq analysis of PAMH F3 ovaries versus control ovaries (p\u00a0= 0.009; Data S1 ), even though the adjusted p value did not reach statistical significance (p adj = 0.36; Data S1 ). Overall, these experiments identified many genes and pathways associated with the PCOS reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, with altered DNA methylation profile in ovaries of the third generation of PAMH offspring.

(C) Genomic DNA was isolated from hypothalami dissected from CNTR (n\u00a0= 6\u20137) and PAMH F3 offspring (n\u00a0= 4\u20135) and MeDIP-PCR experiments performed in the two groups of animals.

(D) qRT-PCR analyses using primers against the genes listed were performed in hypothalamic tissues of CNTR (n\u00a0= 6\u20138) and PAMH F3 offspring (n\u00a0= 4\u20135). Unpaired one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, \u2217 p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.005; n.s. not significant. Data in (C) and (D) are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM.   To assess whether changes in DNA methylation detected in ovaries of PAMH F3 animals may also occur in other tissues, we performed MeDIP-PCR experiments in the hypothalamus, as it is the central regulator of both reproductive and metabolic functions, and in the liver, which is responsible for controlling the internal supply of glucose, in CNTR and PAMH F3 animals ( Figure\u00a05 C). We assessed MeDIP efficiency using primers directed against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ), as a negative control, and the testicular gene testis-specific histone H2B ( TSH2B ), as a positive control. We found a strong hypomethylation of GAPDH and a hypermethylation of TSH2B , confirming the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation ( Figures S6 C and S6D). We screened by MeDIP-PCR the methylation levels of Tet1 , Uhrf1 , and of the four common genes between MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq of ovarian tissue: Hdc , Cdkn1a , Sorbs2 , and Robo-1 ( Figure\u00a05 C). Similar to the methylation changes observed in the ovaries of PCOS-like animals, we found a trend for a hypomethylation in the locus of Tet1 (p\u00a0= 0.07; Mann-Whitney test) and a significant hypomethylation in the locus of Hdc (p\u00a0= 0.02; Mann-Whitney test) in the hypothalami of PAMH F3 animals as compared with controls ( Figure\u00a05 C), whereas we did not detect any methylation changes in the other three genes of CNTR and PCOS animals ( Figure\u00a05 C). qRT-PCR validation experiments revealed that among those six genes, three ( Hdc , Cdkn1a , and Robo1 ) were significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus of PAMH F3 mice compared with CNTR ( Figure\u00a05 D). We did not detect any differences in methylation levels in the loci of all the above-mentioned genes in the liver of either animal group ( Figure\u00a0S6 F).    Methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine treatment of PAMH F3 mice normalizes their neuroendocrine reproductive and metabolic phenotypes  Since our MeDIP-seq analyses pointed to a preponderance of hypomethylation in ovarian tissues of PCOS-like animals compared with control animals, we then examined the therapeutic potential of using the universal methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in an epigenetic preclinical investigation ( Figure\u00a06 A). SAM is an important and naturally occurring biomolecule found ubiquitously in all living cells and functions as the primary methyl donor for all transmethylation reactions ( Bottiglieri, 2002 ) and can thereby be used to promote methylation of otherwise hypomethylated tissues ( Figure\u00a06 A). We first analyzed estrous cyclicity of adult control (CNTR; 6-month-old group 1) and PAMH F3 offspring (6\u00a0months old) for 25 and 10\u00a0days, respectively, to confirm the oligo-anovulatory phenotype of PCOS-like animals ( Figure\u00a06 B). Thereafter, we monitored for additional 15\u00a0days vaginal cytology of PAMH F3 animals treated either with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of PBS (group 2) or with 50\u00a0mg/kg daily injections of SAM (group 3). We collected tail-blood samples for LH and T measurements at diestrus (day 10), before the beginning of\u00a0the treatment, and we harvested trunk blood and ovaries at day 25 (diestrus) at the moment of the sacrifice, corresponding to the end of the treatment period ( Figure\u00a06 B). PAMH F3 animals of group 2 displayed prolonged time in metestrus and diestrus, as compared with control offspring, whereas SAM treatment restored normal ovulation of PCOS animals of group 3 ( Figure\u00a06 C). In addition, SAM treatment restored the aberrant LH and T concentrations of PAMH F3 offspring ( Figures 6 D and 6E), as well as their body weight and their body mass composition to control conditions ( Figure\u00a06 F). Similar to the PAMH F1 animals, the third generation of PCOS-like females were also hyperglycemic ( Figure\u00a06 G), suggesting that hyperglycemia was transgenerationally passed from F1 to F3 PAMH offspring. The methylating agent lowered total glucose levels of PAMH F3 animals close to control conditions. However, no statistical significance was reached upon 15\u00a0days of SAM treatment ( Figure\u00a06 G). Furthermore, we observed that the pancreatic islet hyperplasia detected in PAMH F1 animals ( Figure\u00a02 E) was still present in the third generation ( Figure\u00a06 H) and that it was normalized upon SAM administration ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Figure\u00a06 Epigenetic therapy restores PCOS neuroendocrine, reproductive, and metabolic traits in PAMH F3 adult females (A) Schematic of experimental design whereby adult (6\u00a0months old) PAMH F3 females have been treated or not with i.p. injections of SAM. SAM functions as the primary methyl donor for transmethylation reactions and acts by adding 5\u2032 methylcytosine groups to the otherwise hypomethylated DNA. (B) Representative estrous cyclicity and experimental design. Prenatally PBS-treated, group 1 (n\u00a0= 5, 6\u00a0months old); PAMH F3 animals, group 2 (n\u00a0= 5, 6\u00a0months old); and SAM-treated, group 3 (n\u00a0= 5, 6\u00a0months old). The y axis refers to the different stages of the estrous cycle: metestrus/diestrus (M/D), estrus (E), and proestrus (P). The x axis represents the time course of the experiments (days). Tail-blood samples were collected for LH and T measurements at day 10 (diestrus), before the beginning of the treatment, and trunk blood was collected at day 25 (diestrus) at the moment of the sacrifice, corresponding to the end of the treatment period. (C) Scatterplot representing the percentage (%) of time spent in each estrous cycle in the three groups of animals, respectively. The horizontal line in each scatter plot corresponds to the median value. The vertical line represents the 25th\u201375th percentile range. (D) Mean LH levels were measured in diestrus CNTR mice (n\u00a0= 10) and in group 2 (n\u00a0= 5) and group 3 (n\u00a0= 5) before the treatment (day 10) and after the treatment (day 25). (E) Mean T levels measured in diestrus in CNTR mice (n\u00a0= 10) and in group 2 (n\u00a0= 5) and group 3 (n\u00a0= 5) before the treatment (day 10) and after the treatment (day 25).

Scale bar, 50\u00a0\u03bcm. (I) Quantitative analysis of the mean area of the islets in CNTR (n\u00a0= 4), PAMH F3 (n\u00a0= 5), and PAMH F3 after SAM treatment (n\u00a0= 5). Values in (D)\u2013(G) and (I) are represented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM. For statistical analysis, p values were calculated by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test (C), by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test (D, E, G, and I), or by Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test (F). Statistical significance for all analyses was \u2217 p\u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.005; \u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0005; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0001; n.s. not significant.   To further explore the effect of SAM on gene expression levels, we harvested the ovaries from CNTR, PAMH F3, and PAMH F3-SAM animals at the end of the treatment period and performed qRT-PCR experiments ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). While Tet1 transcript levels were comparable in the three animal groups, Uhrf1 was significantly higher in PAMH F3 ovaries ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). Notably, SAM treatment restored Uhrf1 expression in PAMH F3 mice to normal conditions ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). We then selected three genes involved in ovarian function and insulin transport that we found both differentially expressed and/or methylated in PAMH F3 offspring versus controls; namely Sorbs2 , Grem1 , and Igfbp6 . Our qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the RNA-seq data and showed a significant downregulation of Sorbs2 in the ovaries of PCOS animals, while its expression remained unaltered after the SAM treatment ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). In agreement with our RNA-seq data, Grem1 and Igfbp6 transcripts were higher and lower, respectively, in PAMH F3 mice as compared with controls ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). The methylating agent did not affect expression levels of those genes neither ( Figure\u00a0S7 A).  As evidence suggests that several metabolic disturbances, including obesity and T2D, are related to the generation of low-grade, chronic inflammation ( Reilly and Saltiel, 2017 ), we next wondered whether a pro-inflammatory state could underlie the metabolic derangements of PAMH F3 mice. We investigated the expression changes in the ovaries of these animals of three genes involved in inflammation and immune response ( Hdc , Ptgs2 , and Rela ). Consistent with our RNA-seq analysis, we identified a 2-fold increase in Hdc and Ptgs2 transcript levels in PAMH F3 ovaries as compared with control animals, which was normalized by the methylating agent ( Figure\u00a0S7 A). Similarly, Rela ( alias NF-\u03baB ) was upregulated in PCOS-like animals and restored to normal levels upon SAM treatment ( Figure\u00a0S7 A).  A positive energy balance is known to initiate an inflammatory response in adipocytes and in hypothalamic centers regulating energy homeostasis ( Jais and Br\u00fcning, 2017 ; Reilly and Saltiel, 2017 ). Thus, we next investigated gene expression changes in visceral fat and hypothalamus of CNTR, PAMH F3, and PAMH F3-SAM animals. We found that Uhrf1 was significantly overexpressed in PAMH F3 visceral fat compared with CNTR ( Figure\u00a0S7 B) and completely restored by the SAM treatment ( Figure\u00a0S7 B). Similar to the ovaries of PAMH animals, we found in the visceral fat of PAMH F3 mice a significantly higher transcript expression of inflammatory genes ( Hdc and Rela ) and pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Il1b and Il6 ) as compared with controls ( Figure\u00a0S7 B). Among those genes, the epigenetic treatment restored only Rela expression levels ( Figure\u00a0S7 B). Finally, we found a significant overexpression of Hdc , Ptgs2 , Il1b , Il6 , and Tnfa in the hypothalamus of PAMH F3 animals ( Figure\u00a0S7 C). The methylating agent normalized the expression of all the inflammatory pathways, except for Il1b ( Figure\u00a0S7 C).  To determine whether the rescue of LH and T levels observed in PAMH F3 females upon SAM treatment ( Figures 6 D and 6E) was associated with a central neuroendocrine effect of the methylation agent, we next investigated the expression of two genes regulating proper hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) functions, Gnrh1 and Kiss1 , in the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) dissected from the three groups of animals ( Figure\u00a0S7 D). We found a significant upregulation of both transcripts in the POA of PAMH F3 mice compared with CNTR ( Figure\u00a0S7 D). However, the methylating agent was not able to restore Gnrh1 or Kiss1 levels of PCOS animals to control conditions ( Figure\u00a0S7 D).    Common epigenetic signatures in ovarian tissue of PAMH lineage and blood of women with PCOS  To investigate how our findings in mice might relate to human PCOS, we searched by MeDIP-PCR for common epigenetic signatures in blood samples of women with PCOS and control women (CNTR), as well as in post-pubertal daughters born to mothers with or without PCOS (PCOS-D and CNTR-D; Figure\u00a07 A; Tables S2 and S3 ). We assessed MeDIP efficiency using primers directed against GAPDH and TSH2B ( Figure\u00a0S6 E). Taking into account the hypomethylation of two key DNA methylation related genes in PAMH F3 ovaries, Tet1 and Uhrf1 , that could contribute to the preponderance of global DNA hypomethylation identified in PCOS-like mice, we first assessed the methylation levels of TET1 and UHRF1 in blood samples of women with PCOS and in healthy women. Interestingly, TET1 was significantly hypomethylated in PCOS women as compared with controls, whereas methylation levels of UHRF1 were comparable in the two groups ( Figure\u00a07 B). Figure\u00a07 Common epigenetic signatures in human blood samples from women with PCOS (A) Schematic illustration of the experimental design. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of a case-control study comprising two cohorts of women. Group 1: women with and without PCOS (CNTR). Group 2: post-pubertal control daughters born to mothers without PCOS (CNTR-D) and daughters with PCOS born to mothers with PCOS (PCOS-D). Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation using antibody against anti-5mC, followed by PCR (MeDIP-PCR) using specific primers against the genes listed in (B) and (C) was performed in the two groups. (B) MeDIP-PCR analyses in CNTR women (n\u00a0= 15) and women with PCOS (n\u00a0= 32). (C) MeDIP-PCR analyses in daughters from the control group (CNTR-D, n\u00a0= 3) and daughters with PCOS of women with PCOS (PCOS-D, n\u00a0= 5). Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM. Unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. \u2217 p\u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.005; n.s. not significant.   We next selected the four ovarian genes that were differentially expressed and methylated in the PAMH F3 offspring versus controls and investigated the expression of the human equivalent of those genes, ROBO-1 , SORBS2 , CDKN1A , and HDC as well as IGFBPL1 (encoding for insulin-like growth factor binding protein like 1) and IRS4 (encoding for insulin receptor substrate 4), which may be related to defects in insulin signaling in PCOS. We identified five ( ROBO-1 , CDKN1A , HDC , IGFBPL1 , and IRS4 ) out of the six genes selected from the genome-wide methylation profile of the PAMH lineage as being also differentially methylated in blood samples of women with PCOS as compared with healthy women ( Figure\u00a07 B). Notably, all changes identified were located in the promoter regions of these genes.  ROBO-1 , HDC , and IGFBPL1 were also hypomethylated in blood samples of post-pubertal daughters, diagnosed with PCOS, and born to mothers with PCOS as compared with control daughters ( Figure\u00a07 C). Daughters with PCOS also showed a trend to lower methylation levels of TET1 as compared with controls (p\u00a0= 0.07; Figure\u00a07 C).     Discussion  Familial clustering and twin studies point to PCOS as a pathology with a strong heritable component ( McAllister et\u00a0al., 2015 ). However, the human PCOS loci identified by genome-wide association studies account for less than 10% of heritability ( Azziz, 2016 ), suggesting that environmental and epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the etiology of this disease.  Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that altered levels of androgens or AMH during pregnancy may be responsible for the fetal programing of PCOS ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Hence, PNA and PAMH animals are excellent preclinical models to mimic a key maternal PCOS condition in which to investigate whether exposed lineages have increased susceptibility to develop PCOS-like traits in F1\u2013F3 offspring ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2020 ). A recent study highlights transgenerational transmission of PCOS-like phenotypes in PNA mice exposed or not to maternal high-fat diet ( Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ). That investigation also identifies several genes with altered expression in mouse oocytes from F1\u2013F3 offspring and in the serum of daughters of women with PCOS ( Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ). However, the mechanisms underlying the inheritance and transmission of PCOS traits to subsequent generations have not been elucidated. To dissect the cascade of molecular events leading to increased disease susceptibility, we used the PAMH mouse model, which recapitulates the major neuroendocrine reproductive traits of PCOS ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Compared with the PNA mouse model, in which litter size, estrous cyclicity, and androgen levels of the offspring are unaffected in the second and third generation ( Risal et\u00a0al., 2019 ), the transmission of PCOS-typical reproductive defects is more severe in the PAMH lineage, which pass on to subsequent generations all the major diagnostic features of PCOS: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunctions, and altered fertility. This is most likely the result of the different prenatal hormonal exposure protocols used to generate the two mouse models. The PNA model relies on the prenatal non-aromatizable DHT exposure during late gestation while the latter model is derived from exposing the dams to AMH during the same gestational window as the PNA mice ( Stener-Victorin et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Such treatment drives a 3-fold rise in aromatizable T levels in the dams with subsequent changes in the HPG axis and hormone levels of both the dams and the progeny ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). In this study, we also report the appearance of the major metabolic derangements of the human PCOS condition in PAMH mice at six months of postnatal life, including typical traits of T2D and a \u03b2 cell hyperplasia in the pancreas of PAMH animals of the first and third generation. Islet cell hyperplasia is associated with T2D in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse, which has been extensively studied as a model for this disease for decades ( Bock et\u00a0al., 2003 ). Our preclinical data are in line with the observation that up to 30%\u201340% of women with PCOS have impaired glucose tolerance, and as many as 10% of those women develop T2D by the age of 40 ( Diamanti-Kandarakis and Dunaif, 2012 ; Wild et\u00a0al., 2010 ). Consistently, our RNA-seq analysis reveals a significant enrichment in the ovaries of PAMH F3 mice of genes involved in the negative regulation of insulin secretion, including Inhbb , Ide , Fst , and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, which also regulate folliculogenesis and ovarian steroidogenesis ( Findlay, 1993 ; Liu et\u00a0al., 2016 ) and which are affected in human PCOS ovarian tissues ( Liu et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Pan et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Dysfunction of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in PCOS may be generalized in different organs. Indeed, Dumesic and colleagues ( Dumesic et\u00a0al., 2019 ) report TGF-\u03b2 signaling as the \u201cmaster upstream regulatory gene\u201d in subcutaneous adipose stem cells from women with PCOS in contrast to non-PCOS women. In addition, in PCOS-like, prenatally androgenized female rhesus monkeys, similar disruption of TGF-\u03b2 signaling accompanies altered DNA methylation patterns of visceral fat, implying an androgen-related developmental origin in PCOS for abdominal fat accumulation ( Xu et\u00a0al., 2011 ).  Our MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq data show that many affected genes in the ovarian tissue of PCOS animals are correlated with inflammatory and metabolic pathways, typical of the human PCOS condition ( Boyle and Teede, 2016 ; Dumesic et\u00a0al., 2015 ; V\u00e1zquez-Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Interestingly, alterations in ovarian gene expression patterns, detected in 2-month-old PCOS-like animals, precede the appearance of phenotypic metabolic manifestations in these animals, occurring only few months later, at 6\u00a0months. Our preclinical data are also in agreement with several clinical studies reporting DNA methylation changes related to inflammation, hormone-related processes, and glucose and lipid metabolism in various tissues of women with PCOS ( Makrinou et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Shen et\u00a0al., 2013 ; V\u00e1zquez-Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Genetic and epigenetic modifications are implicated in the transgenerational inheritance of prenatally programed diseases ( Cavalli and Heard, 2019 ; Gapp et\u00a0al., 2014 ) and in recent years, epigenetic factors gained considerable attention in the study of PCOS ( Escobar-Morreale, 2018 ; Makrinou et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Patel, 2018 ; V\u00e1zquez-Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Here, we identify many differentially methylated genes in PAMH F3 ovaries associated with the PCOS phenotype, with a preponderance of hypomethylation detected in these animals. Interestingly, we find that some of the epigenetic signatures and associated gene expression changes detected in the ovaries of PAMH F3 animals are also present in other metabolic tissues, such as the hypothalamus and the visceral fat. These results suggest that altered methylation landscape and transcriptional changes, transgenerationally inherited in PCOS animals, span across multiple tissues involved in the control of ovarian function and metabolism. Such DNA methylation differences are not just general hypomethylation events, but they occur in specific genes and pathways associated with reproductive and metabolic traits associated with PCOS. As we find that all hormonal, reproductive, and metabolic alterations of PAMH F1 offspring are maintained in the third generation, we cannot exclude that AMH fetal-determined changes in epigenetic marks, in combination with the recurring high testosterone levels and perhaps with the metabolic disturbances of the PAMH lineage may be the programing agents responsible for the acquisition and transmission of PCOS-like traits through modifications of DNA methylation landscapes. Also, we cannot exclude a mechanism involving de-methylation and re-methylation that occurred during development in primordial germ cells. Indeed, the maternal genome undergoes passive demethylation before subsequent re-methylation at specific loci to ensure epigenetic inheritance, in which Uhrf1 is a key component ( Zeng and Chen, 2019 ). Our data showing overexpression of Uhrf1 in PAMH F3 ovary and visceral fat, that is rescued by SAM treatment, support the notion that maintenance of the methylation machinery is a crucial event in the inheritance of PCOS.  We speculate that a global loss of DNA methylation, particularly in promoter-TSS and upstream-promoters, could be responsible for genomic instability in the disease condition. Consistently, a genome-wide DNA methylation study on umbilical cord blood reports a prevalence of hypomethylation in women with PCOS compared with unaffected women ( Lambertini et\u00a0al., 2017 ). As genomic instability is highly correlated with DNA damage, excessive DNA demethylation could be thus associated with impaired DNA damage repair. This is in line with many reports describing a strong association between PCOS and malignancies, such as ovarian and endometrial cancer ( Escobar-Morreale, 2018 ), and suggest that a higher predisposition to cancer detected in women with PCOS could be due to altered DNA methylation landscapes.  Mechanistically, we identify a significant hypomethylation in the locus of two key genes involved in DNA demethylation ( Tet1 ) and DNA methylation maintenance ( Uhrf1 ) in PAMH F3 ovaries compared with control ovaries of which our RNA-seq data show increased Tet1 expression with a significant p value. Consistently, we find TET1 significantly hypomethylated in blood samples of women with PCOS as compared with control women and a trend to a hypomethylation of this gene is also present in daughters with PCOS. As TET1 is one of the family members of 5mC dioxygenases, which initiate demethylation, it is possible that the decreased levels of TET1 methylation observed in women with PCOS could contribute to the preponderance of global DNA hypomethylation characterizing the disease.  In this study, we report that only 4 genes showed concordance between RNA-seq and methylation analyses in ovarian tissues of PCOS animals ( Robo-1 , Sorbs2 , Cdkn1a , and Hdc ). However, a far more complex relationship exists between DNA methylation and transcriptional processes, which can be regulated by other epigenetic mechanisms. Indeed, the methylation of the first exon is negatively correlated to gene expression in a more pronounced way than methylations of the promoter regions ( Brenet et\u00a0al., 2011 ). Moreover, previous studies suggest a permissive state of gene expression linked with low methylation, but not a linear inhibitory link with high methylation ( Anastasiadi et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Based on the canonical view of 5mC being a repressor of transcription ( Deaton and Bird, 2011 ), our results indicate a mismatch between the methylation state and the level of gene expression for Robo-1 and Cdkn1a . Considering that the most hypomethylated genes emerging from our analysis are related to chromatin remodeling and chromatin modification, it is likely that, besides DNA methylation, other epigenetic events, such as histone acetylation/methylation are modulated altering gene expression, which could in part explain the weak correlation that we observe between MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq. In line with these findings, histone acetylation alterations are present in various tissues of women with the disease ( Qu et\u00a0al., 2012 ; V\u00e1zquez-Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Remarkably, we report that several of the differentially methylated genes identified in ovarian tissues of PCOS mice of the third generation are also altered in blood samples from women with PCOS and from daughters of women with PCOS compared with healthy women. Six genes associated with DNA demethylation ( TET1 ), axon guidance ( ROBO-1 ), inhibition of cell proliferation ( CDKN1A ), inflammation ( HDC ), and insulin signaling ( IGFBPL1 , IRS4 ) are hypomethylated in women with PCOS as compared with controls, and three genes ( ROBO-1 , HDC , and IGFBPL1 ) are also hypomethylated in daughters diagnosed with PCOS. As the BMI of women with PCOS included in this investigation is not significantly different compared with controls, both in unrelated women and in CNTR-D and PCOS-D ( Tables S2 and S3 ), and because several metabolic parameters (fasting insulin, fasting glycemia, and triglycerides) are within the normal range in the PCOS groups, we can exclude a priori the contribution of metabolic alterations on the differential methylation landscape of women with PCOS versus control women. We should also note that control women recruited in this study are significantly older than women with PCOS ( Table S2 ), raising the possibility of the existence of an age-dependent epigenetic effect. However, the observation that hypomethylation occurs in daughters with PCOS age-matched with control daughters ( Table S3 ; age CNTR-D: 24\u00a0\u00b1 4.4, PCOS-D: 26\u00a0\u00b1 2.0), in the same genes as those detected in blood samples of women with PCOS suggests that DNA methylation changes are mostly associated with the PCOS status rather than being influenced by age.  As DNA methylation epigenetic changes can precede phenotypic manifestation and display more stability than gene expression alterations ( Kelly et\u00a0al., 2010 ), the differentially methylated genes offer the opportunity to develop valuable diagnostic indicators for PCOS risk or prognostic indicators for the disease progression. Even more importantly, the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications makes them more \u201cdruggable\u201d than attempts to target or correct defects in gene expression itself. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation are involved in several disease conditions ( Kelly et\u00a0al., 2010 ). Several inhibitors of DNA methylation are currently approved for many pathologies by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been in clinical use for many years ( Kelly et\u00a0al., 2010 ). However, at present, there are no FDA-approved therapeutic modalities that target hypomethylation. Here, we examined the therapeutic potential of SAM, a known natural agent causing methylation of several genes ( Chik et\u00a0al., 2014 ). To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for the potential therapeutic effect of SAM in a preclinical model of PCOS. Our investigation showed that SAM treatment can rescue the major PCOS reproductive neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations of PAMH F3 mice, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of methylating agents as promising epigenetic therapies aimed at treating women with PCOS. We provide evidence that the methylating agent restores the aberrant expression of most inflammatory genes investigated in the ovaries as well as in metabolic tissues of PAMH F3 adult mice. Numerous studies show a causal link between low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases, including T2D ( Reilly and Saltiel, 2017 ). Moreover, the degree of inflammation correlates well with the severity of insulin resistance, T2D, and hyperandrogenism related to PCOS ( Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al., 2006 ; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2015 ). However, the precise triggers of PCOS-associated inflammation are poorly understood. Based on our findings we can speculate that the trigger for tissue inflammations could emanate from altered DNA methylation landscapes, which can be corrected by the SAM.  Taken together, this study points to AMH excess during gestation as a detrimental factor leading to the transgenerational transmission of PCOS cardinal neuroendocrine, reproductive, and metabolic alterations and shed lights into the epigenetic modifications underlying the susceptibility of the disease while pointing to novel diagnostic tools and epigenetic-based therapeutic avenues to treat the disease.   Limitations of study  In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of epigenetic changes at the ovarian level as drivers of the susceptibility of PCOS across generations. However, we have not performed genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA-seq profiling of the hypothalamic tissue of control and PCOS animals. Hence, we cannot rule out that gene expression modifications and\u00a0DNA methylation changes possibly affecting the hypothalamus of PCOS-like animals may also play a role in this phenomenon. Moreover, we have not fully assessed if SAM treatment can also normalize the reproductive deficits of PAMH animals.  Future studies, using genome-wide DNA methylation approaches, in combination with preclinical phenotypic investigations, are also necessary to determine whether re-methylation after the epigenetic treatment could potentially drive adverse secondary phenotypic effects at long term. Finally, our clinical investigation identifies methylome markers in the blood of women with PCOS as possible diagnostic landmarks and candidates for epigenetic-based therapies. However, these markers need to be confirmed in larger cohorts of patients, segregating endocrine and metabolic characteristics related to risk and severity of PCOS, to suggest their use as an effective personalized screening and treatment intervention.

Materials availability  This study did not generate new unique reagents.    Data and code availability  The accession number for the RNA-seq and MeDIPseq data from mouse ovaries from CNTR and PAMH F3 females reported in this paper is GEO: GSE148839 . All the other data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary information files and from the lead contact author upon request.     Experimental model and subject details   Human studies  Blood samples have been collected prospectively, from 2003 to 2008, to perform genetic studies, in the Reproductive Medicine Department of Jeanne de Flandre in Lille University Hospital, France. Biological and clinical data about patients were collected at the same time. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lille University Hospital (DRC BT/JR/DS/N\u00b0 0231 PROM 02-563 CP 03/11). Written informed consent was obtained for all patients. Patients were initially referred to our department for hyperandrogenism (HA) and/or oligo-anovulation and/or infertility. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the presence of at least 2 out of the 3 following Rotterdam criteria ( Rotterdam, 2004 ), i.e.,: \u22121) HA (clinical or biological). Clinical HA was defined by the presence of hirsutism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey score over 7 and/or acne located in more than two areas). Hyperandrogenism was defined as a serum TT level > 0,39\u00a0ng/ml and/or a serum androstenedione level (A) >2,2\u00a0ng/ml, as previously reported ( Dewailly et\u00a0al., 2011 ) \u22122) oligo-anovulation, (i.e. oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea); \u22123) presence of Polycystic Ovarian Morphology (PCOM) at ultrasound (U/S), with an ovarian area \u2265 5.5\u00a0cm 2 and/or a follicle number per ovary \u2265 12, unilaterally or bilaterally. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome, androgen secreting tumor or hyperprolactinemia were excluded. Women with PCOS were asked about familial history and the genetic study was also proposed to their mothers and sisters. The latter were asked about their personal clinical history (age, body mass index, age of first menstruations, cycle length, presence of hirsutism or acne). For sisters who didn\u2019t have any contraceptive treatment, hormonal assays were also performed in the follicular phase. Based on this information, they were classified as women with PCOS or control, if possible.  Biochemical and hormonal measurement tests were performed in the central biochemistry department of Lille and included: estradiol, LH and FSH, total testosterone, delta4 androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, SDHEA, SBP, prolactinemia, fasting glucose, insulinemia and lipid profile. Estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, LH and FSH were measured by immunoassays as previously described ( Dewailly et\u00a0al., 2011 ; Pigny et\u00a0al., 1997 ). Fasting serum insulin levels were measured in duplicate by an immunoradiometric assay (Bi-Insulin IRMA Pasteur, Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette, France) that uses two monoclonal anti-insulin antibodies. Intra and interassay coefficient of variation were <3,8 and <7,5% respectively. Results are expressed as milli international units per liter.  47 blood samples have been recently analyzed from 32 women with PCOS (18-65 years old) and 15 women without PCOS (22-66 years old). Among the 32 PCOS women, five were born from PCOS mothers (23-30 years old) and among the 15 control women, 3\u00a0were confirmed to be born from control mothers (22-36 years old).  All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2008.    Mouse models  All C57BL/6J (B6) mice (Charles River, USA) were group-housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-controlled room (21-22\u00b0C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. Standard diet (9.5\u00a0mm Pelleted RM3, Special Diets Services, France) was given to all mice during breeding, lactation and growth of young stock. Nutritional profile of the standard diet RM3 is the following: Protein 22.45%, Fat 4.2%, Fiber 4.42%, Ash 8%, Moisture 10%, Nitrogen free extract 50.4%; Calories: 3.6\u00a0kcal/gr. F0 C57BL/6J mice were used directly after arrival into the animal facility and after an acclimatization period of at least 2\u00a0weeks.  Mice were randomly assigned to groups at the time of purchase or weaning to minimize any potential bias. No data sets were excluded from analyses. The animals were daily for health issues by qualified personnel; health status was normal for all animals.  Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of Care and Use of Experimental Animals of the University of Lille (France; Ethical protocol number: APAFIS#2617-2015110517317420 v5 and APAFIS#13387-2017122712209790 v9). All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal use specified by the European Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU). The sample size, sex and age of the animals used is specified in the text and/or figure legends.     Method details   Prenatal anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (PAMH) treatment  PAMH animals have been generated as previously described ( Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Timed-pregnant adult (3-4\u00a0months) C57BL6/J (B6) dams were injected daily intraperitoneally (i.p.) from embryonic day (E) 16.5 to 18.5 with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of a solution containing respectively: 1) 0.01\u00a0M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, prenatal control-treated, CNTR), 2) PBS with 0.12\u00a0mgKg -1 /d human anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) (AMH C , R&D Systems, rhMIS 1737-MS-10, prenatal AMH (PAMH)-treated).    Mouse breeding scheme and feeding paradigm to generate F1\u2013F3 offspring  PAMH female offspring (F1) were mated with F1 PAMH unrelated males to generate PAMH F2 offspring, and a subset of PAMH F2 female offspring were mated with PAMH F2 unrelated males to generate PAMH F3 offspring. The remaining F1, F2 and F3 female offspring were subjected to phenotypic testing as described below. Control male or female offspring (CNTR) used in this study were generated by prenatally treating gestating mice with PBS from E16.5 to E18.5 as described above.  The exact number of mice used for each procedure and their sex and age are given in the figure legends and/or text. Details of the number of mice used for (1) phenotypic testing and (2) breeding to generate F1, F2 and F3 offspring in each group are specified in in the figure legends and/or text. To ensure variability within each group, offspring in each generation were randomly allocated for phenotypic testing or breeding.    Assessment of phenotype, estrous cycle, and fertility  Control F1 and PAMH F1-F3 female offspring were weaned at post-natal day P21 and checked for vaginal opening (VO) and time of first estrus. Anogenital distance (AGD) and body mass (grams, g) were measured at different ages during post-natal development (P30, 35, 40, 50 and 60). At VO and in adulthood (P60), vaginal smears were performed daily for 16 consecutive days (4-cycles) for analysis of age of first estrus and estrous cyclicity. Vaginal cytology was analyzed under an inverted microscope to identify the specific stage of the estrous cycle. The reproductive competency of these animals was determined by pairing the following mice: CNTR F1 females mated with CNTR F1 males, CNTR F1 males mated with PAMH F1-F3 females, PAMH F1-F3 females mated with PAMH F1-F3 males, for a period of 3\u00a0months. Unexperienced males and primiparous females, selected from at least three different litters, were used for the 90-days mating protocol test. Number of pups/litter (number of pups), fertility index (number of litters per females over 3\u00a0months), and time to first litter (number of days to first litter after pairing) were quantified per treatment and pairing.    Ovarian histology  Ovaries were collected from 3-month-old diestrus mice, immersion-fixed in 4% PFA solution and stored at 4\u00b0C. Paraffin-embedded ovaries were sectioned at a thickness of 5\u00a0\u03bcm (histology facility, University of Lille 2, France) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Sigma Aldrich, Cat # GHS132, HT1103128). Sections were examined throughout the ovary. Total numbers of corpora lutea (CL) were classified and quantified as previously reported ( Caldwell et\u00a0al., 2017 ). To avoid repetitive counting, each follicle was only counted in the section where the oocyte\u2019s nucleolus was visible. To avoid repetitive counting, CL were counted every 100\u00a0\u03bcm by comparing the section with the preceding and following sections. CL were characterized by a still present central cavity, filled with blood and follicular fluid remnants or by prominent polyhedral to round luteal cells.    LH and T ELISA assays  LH levels were determined by a sandwich ELISA, using a well-established ELISA method ( Steyn et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). A mouse LH-RP reference was provided by Albert F. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Torrance, California, USA). The assay sensitivity of the LH ELISA was 0.04\u00a0ng/ml and intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4.3%. Plasma T levels were analyzed using a commercial ELISA (Demeditec Diagnostics, GmnH, DEV9911) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions as previously validated in other studies ( Moore et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Tata et\u00a0al., 2018 ). The assay sensitivity is 0.066\u00a0ng/ml at the 2 standard deviation confidence limit. Intra-assay coefficient of variation for testosterone was 7 % and inter-assay coefficient of variation was 11.0%. 20\u00a0\u03bcl of plasma was used for the testosterone assay, run in duplicate samples.  As T and LH levels can vary significantly due to handling, sampling techniques and depending on the time of the day, female adult mice were habituated with daily handling for 3\u00a0weeks. Blood samples were taken from trunk blood, for T measurements, and from the tail, for LH measurements, between 10h00 and 12h00 during diestrus.    Body weight and composition  Whole body fat, fluids, and lean tissue mass were determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. (MiniSpec mq 7.5, RMN Analyser, Bruker) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.    Measurement of fasting blood glucose and insulin level  Fasting blood glucose levels were assessed after animals were fasted for 12\u00a0h (starting from 8:00 PM). Blood glucose levels were determined in blood samples from the tail vein at 8:00 AM using an automatic glucometer (OneTouch Verio, Life scan). Fasting Insulin levels were determined in plasma samples after sacrifice, by a sandwich Insulin ELISA (Mercodia, Cat #10-1247-01) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions.    Glucose and insulin tolerance tests  For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), animals were subjected to an overnight fasting (14\u00a0h food withdrawal). For intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT), mice were fasted for 4 h. Either glucose (2 g/kg body weight) or human normal insulin (0.75\u00a0U/kg body weight) were injected intraperitoneally at 0 (prior to glucose or insulin administration) and blood was collected from the tail vein at different time points (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 150). Plasma glucose was measured using an automatic glucometer (OneTouch Verio, Life scan).    Optical clearing of mouse pancreas  Whole-organ staining and clearing were performed using iDISCO+ ( Renier et\u00a0al., 2014 ). Pancreata were dissected from perfused animals and processed as described below. Samples were dehydrated [20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% methanol at room temperature (RT)], delipidated [100% dichloromethane (DCM; Sigma-Aldrich)], and bleached in 5% H2O2 (overnight, 4\u00b0C). Pancreata were rehydrated (80, 60, 40, and 20% methanol) and permeabilized [PBS/0.2% TritonX-100 (twice for 1h)] before proceeding to the staining procedures. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C on an adjustable rotator in 10\u00a0ml of a blocking solution (PBSGNaT) of 1X PBS containing 0.2% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% NaAzide for 3 nights. Samples were transferred to 10\u00a0ml of PBSGNaT containing primary antibodies (FLEX polyclonal guinea pig anti-insulin ready-to-use, DAKO IR00261-2, 1:2; monoclonal rabbit anti-glucagon antibody [EP3070], Abcam ab92517, 1:500) and placed at 37\u00b0C in rotation for 7\u00a0days. This was followed by six washes of 30\u00a0min in PBSGT at RT and a final wash in PBSGT overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next, samples were incubated in secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, 1:500), goat anti-Guinea Pig Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, 1:500), diluted in 10\u00a0ml PBSGNaT for 5\u00a0days at 37\u00b0C in a rotating tube. After six 30-min washes in PBS at room temperature, the samples were stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C in the dark until clearing. Samples were washed with PBSGNaT (five times, RT) and PBS (five times, RT), dehydrated with a methanol gradient, then washed in 100% methanol (three times, 1\u00a0hr each) and incubated overnight with 66% DCM/33% Methanol and then in 100% DCM until the sample sank (15\u00a0min to 45\u00a0min). The clearing step was performed in 100% Benzyl ether (DBE; Sigma-Aldrich).    Light-sheet imaging  3D imaging was performed as previously described ( Belle et\u00a0al., 2014 ). An ultramicroscope (LaVision BioTec) using ImspectorPro software (LaVision BioTec) was used to perform imaging. The light sheet was generated by a laser (wavelength 488 or 561\u00a0nm, Coherent Sapphire Laser, LaVision BioTec) and two cylindrical lenses. A binocular stereomicroscope (MXV10, Olympus) with a 2\u00d7 objective (MVPLAPO, Olympus) was used at different magnifications (1.6\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7, and 6.3\u00d7). Samples were placed in an imaging reservoir made of 100% quartz (LaVision BioTec) filled with DBE and illuminated from the side by the laser light. A PCO Edge SCMOS CCD camera (2560\u00a0\u00d7 2160 pixel size, LaVision BioTec) was used to acquire images. The step size between each image was fixed at 2\u00a0\u03bcm.  Images, 3D volume, and movies were generated using Imaris x64 software (version 7.6.1, Bitplane). Stack images were first converted to imaris file (.ims) using ImarisFileConverter and 3D recontruction was performed using \u201cvolume rendering\u201d. Optical slices of samples were obtained using the \u201corthoslicer\u201d tools. The surface of the samples was created using the \u201csurface\u201d tool by creating a mask around each volume. 3D pictures were generated using the \u201csnapshot\u201d tool. Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to process, adjust and merge the photomontages. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CC.    Immunohistochemistry on pancreatic sections  Pancreata from control ( n = 4), PAMH F3 ( n = 5) and PAMHF3\u00a0+ SAM ( n = 5) animals were collected and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 hours. Pancreata were then rinsed in PBS, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, and the blocks were sectioned on a microtome at 8\u00a0\u03bcm thickness.  Before immunofluorescence experiments, the sections underwent deparaffinization: incubation in xylene 2 times x 5\u00a0min, then rinsed with 100% ethanol (2 times x 5\u00a0minutes), and rehydrated in a decreasing gradient of Ethanol/H 2 0 (100%, 90%, 75%, 5\u00a0minutes each) and finally transferred to PBS.  Antigen retrieval was performed as follows: the slides were incubated for 30\u00a0minutes in 10\u00a0mM citrate buffer heated to 95\u00b0C. They were brought back to room temperature and rinsed with PBS. The sections were blocked for 30\u00a0minutes in blocking buffer (PBS\u00a0+ 7% NGS\u00a0+ 0.3% triton X100), then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 48 hours at 4\u00b0C. After three rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated for 1h at RT with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Finally, the sections were rinsed three times in PBS before nuclear staining with DAPI (1:5000 in PBS) and mounting with Mowiol. The slides were allowed to dry before imaging. Primary antibodies used were: FLEX polyclonal guinea pig anti-insulin ready-to-use (DAKO IR00261-2, 1:2), recombinant monoclonal rabbit anti-glucagon antibody [EP3070] (Abcam ab92517, 1:500). Secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, 1:500), goat anti-Guinea Pig Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antibody (Life Technologies, 1:500).    Image acquisition and analysis  Single-plane acquisitions of pancreatic sections from control ( n = 4), PAMH F3 ( n = 5) and PAMHF3\u00a0+ SAM ( n = 5) animals were performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with a 20X/0.8 objective. Insulin staining was used to measure the area of the pancreatic islets. For each animal, 3 to 4 random regions of the pancreas were imaged, and all pictures were processed in the same manner using Fiji: pictures were first converted to 8bits, and the insulin staining was segmented by manual thresholding with constant parameters (set to 20-255). The area of the segmented signal was then quantified using the measurement tool.    RNA extraction and RT-qPCR  Ovaries, perigonadal fat and hypothalami were harvest from control F1 and PAMH F3 (treated or not with SAM) female mice and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were homogenized using 1\u00a0ml of Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #15596026) with a tissue homogenizer and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen; Cat # 74804) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For gene expression analyses, cDNA was synthetized from 1000ng of total RNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Cat #4387406) using the manufacturer\u2019s recommended cycling conditions. Real-time PCR was carried out\u00a0on Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system using exon-boundary-specific TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (TermoFisher Scientific). Data were analyzed by using the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) and normalized to housekeeping genes Beta-actin ( ActB ) levels. Values are expressed relative to control values, as appropriate, set at 1.    RNA libraries and sequencing  RNA-Seq libraries were generated from 600\u00a0ng of total RNA using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit and TruSeq RNA Single Indexes kits A and B (Illumina, San Diego, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, following purification with poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads, the mRNA was fragmented using divalent cations at 94\u00b0C for 2\u00a0minutes. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Strand specificity was achieved by replacing dTTP with dUTP during second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Following addition of a single 'A' base and subsequent ligation of the adapter on double stranded cDNA fragments, the products were purified and enriched with PCR (30 sec at 98\u00b0C; [10 sec at 98\u00b0C, 30 sec at 60\u00b0C, 30 sec at 72\u00b0C] x 12 cycles; 5\u00a0min at 72\u00b0C) to create the cDNA library. Surplus PCR primers were further removed by purification using AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter, Villepinte, France) and the final cDNA libraries were checked for quality and quantified using capillary electrophoresis. Libraries were then single-read sequenced with a length of 50 pb, with 8 samples per lane on an Illumina Hiseq4000 sequencer. Image analysis and base calling were carried out using RTA v.2.7.3 and bcl2fastq v.2.17.1.14. Reads were mapped onto the mm10 assembly of Mus musculus genome using STAR ( Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013 ) v.2.5.3a. Gene expression was quantified from uniquely aligned reads using HTSeq-count ( Anders et\u00a0al., 2015 ) v.0.6.1p1 with annotations from Ensembl release and union mode. Data quality was evaluated with RSeQC ( Wang et\u00a0al., 2012 ). Comparisons of read counts were performed using R 3.5.1 with DESeq2 ( Love et\u00a0al., 2014 ) v1.22.1 Bioconductor package. More precisely, counts were normalized from the estimated size factors using the median ratio method and a Wald test was used for the statistical test. Unwanted variation was identified with sva ( Leek, 2014 ) and considered in the statistical model. To reduce false positive, p-values were adjusted by IHW method ( Ignatiadis et\u00a0al., 2016 ).    MeDIP  MeDIP was performed using MagMeDIP kit (Diagenode) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, frozen mouse ovaries (dissected at dioestrus) were chopped and lysed in 1mL GenDNA digestion buffer and DNA was extracted using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA extraction of the liver and hypothalamic tissues were performed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was quantified using the QubitTM DNA BR Assay kit. 1.1\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA was sheared by sonication for six cycles with 30\u2009s ON and 30\u2009s OFF at 4\u2009\u00b0C using the Bioruptor Plus sonicator (Diagenode). Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-5\u2032-methylcytosine mouse monoclonal antibody (Diagenode; Cat nr: C15200081; Lot nr: RD004; 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/immunoprecipitation) or a mouse IgG as a negative control (Diagenode; Cat nr: C15400001; Lot nr: MIG002S; 0.2 ug/immunoprecipitation) and magnetic beads, following MagMeDIP kit settings. One-tenth of the DNA sample was set aside at 4\u2009\u00b0C for input. To check the efficiency of the MeDIP experiment, spike-in controls including unmethylated (unDNA) and in\u00a0vitro methylated DNA (meDNA) from A. thaliana were used. After magnetic beads washes, methylated DNA was isolated using the DNA Isolation Buffer protocol according to the MagMeDIP kit recommendations. DNA concentration was measured using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Efficiency of the immunoprecipitation was assessed by performing qPCR using meDNA and unDNA primers.  MeDIP experiments from human blood were carried using the MagMeDIP protocol as described above with some modifications. DNA was extracted from 200\u00a0\u03bcL of frozen blood using the QIamp DNA blood Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNase A was added prior to cell lysis. DNA was eluted in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of water. Efficiency of the immunoprecipitation of the liver, hypothalamus and human blood samples were assessed by performing qPCR for the mouse/human TSH2B (methylated region) and GAPDH (unmethylated region) (primers provided in the MagMeDIP kit). Methylation quantification was calculated from qPCR data and reported as the recovery of starting material: % (meDNA-IP/Total input)\u2009=\u20092\u02c6[(Ct(10%input)-3.32)\u2009\u2212\u2009Ct(meDNA-IP)]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%.    MeDIP-seq - libraries construction and sequencing  Libraries were prepared using the SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer as single-end 50\u00a0bp reads following Illumina's instructions. Image analysis and base calling were performed using RTA 2.7.3 and bcl2fastq 2.17.1.14. Adapter dimer reads were removed using Dimer Remover. Data were preprocessed with Cutadapt v1.13 ( Martin, 2011 ) to remove the first 9 nucleotides and to remove sequences with a trailing polyT of at least 10 Ts. Cutadapt was used with the following parameters \u2018-u 9 -a T(10) --discard-trimmed\u2019. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using Bowtie v1.0.0 ( Langmead et\u00a0al., 2009 ) with default parameters except for \u201c-p 3 \u2013m 1 --strata --best\u201d. Methylated regions were detected using MACS v1.4.2 ( Zhang et\u00a0al., 2008 ) with default parameters except for \u201c-g mm -p 1e-3\u201d. Regions were then annotated with the closest genes with Homer v4.9.1 annotatePeaks.pl ( Heinz et\u00a0al., 2010 ) with Ensembl v90 annotations.  All regions found in at least 2 replicates of the same condition were retained for the detection of differentially methylated regions. They were then combined to get the union of all peaks using the tool Bedtools merge v2.26.0 ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 ). Read counts were normalized across libraries using the method proposed by ( Anders and Huber, 2010 ). Statistical comparisons of interest were performed using the method proposed by Love et\u00a0al. (2014) implemented in the DESeq2 v1.22.2 Bioconductor library. p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) method. MA plot and Manhattan plots are been generated using custom R scripts.    Methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) treatment  Vaginal cytology was analyzed under an inverted microscope to record the specific stage of the estrous cycle. PAMH F3 offspring were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 15\u00a0days with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of a solution containing 0.01M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) or with SAM (50\u00a0mg/Kg/day; New England Biolegends, Cat. B9003S). This concentration was chosen based on previous in\u00a0vivo pharmacological studies using the same drug ( Li et\u00a0al., 2012 ). Estrous cyclicity was analyzed in adult CNTR offspring (prenatally PBS-treated; Group 1, n = 5, 6\u00a0month-old) for 25\u00a0days and in PAMH F3 animals during 10\u00a0days before treatment. One group of PAMH F3 animals (Group 2; n = 5) was then injected daily with PBS and another group of animals (Group 3; n = 5) was injected with SAM for 15\u00a0days.  Tail-blood samples were collected for LH and T measurements at diestrus before the beginning of the treatments, at day 10, and at the end of the treatment, at day 25.     Quantification and statistical analysis  All analyses were performed using Prism 8 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) and assessed for normality (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and/or D'Agostino & Pearson test) and variance before subsequent analyses by several statistical tests. Sample sizes were chosen according to standard practice in the field. The investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during the experiments. However, analyses were performed by two independent investigators in a blinded fashion. For each experiment, replicates are described in the figure legends. All comparisons between groups, whose distribution was not normal, were performed using Mann-Whitney U test (comparison between two experimental groups) or Kruskal-Wallis test (comparison between three or more experimental groups) followed by a Dunn\u2019s post hoc analysis. For analyses of populations normally distributed, data were compared using an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test or a one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test. The number of biologically independent experiments, sample size, p values, age and sex of the animals are all indicated in the main text or figure legends. All experimental data are indicated as mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM or as the 25 th \u201375 th percentile, line at median. The significance level was set at p\u00a0< 0.05.",
