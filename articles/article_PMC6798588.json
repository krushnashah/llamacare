    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder that affects 15-20% of women of\nreproductive age. The characterization of PCOS may require ultrasound examination\nand the observation of other signs such as irregular menstrual cycles,\nhyperandrogenism leading to acne, alopecia, hirsutism, insulin resistance,\ndyslipidemias, android obesity, early pregnancy loss, and infertility ( Raja-Khan et al ., 2011 ; Stener-Victorin et al ., 2013 ; Marshall & Dunaif, 2012 ).  Despite the relevance and prevalence of PCOS, there is no consensus on how the\ncondition should be treated and managed. Different results have been reported from\ntreatment protocols using metformin and statins. Treatments with myo-inositol and\nN-acetylcysteine have been recently described. Several methods have been used to\ntreat women with PCOS, but there is no agreement on which is the most effective.\nThese points stress the need for more research and studies on the matter ( Banaszewska et al ., 2009 ; 2011 ; Kumar et al ., 2016 ; Salehpour et al ., 2012 ; Yang et al ., 2016 ; Unfer et al ., 2012 ; Aquino & Nori, 2014 ; Artini et al ., 2013 ).  Conventional treatments for PCOS, which include management of symptoms and clinical\nsigns, have little effect on long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease\nand hyperinsulinemia. In recent years, complementary therapies including lifestyle\nchanges, yoga, acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, weight loss, medicinal herbs,\nand vitamins have been used ( Genazzani et\nal ., 2004 ; Aquino & Nori,\n2014 ; Ratnakumari et\nal ., 2018 ; Baillargeon &\nNestler, 2006 ).  Several studies have described an association between PCOS and insulin resistance.\nCentral obesity has been described in 30-40% of women with PCOS, while\nhyperinsulinemia affects more than 80% of them. Insulin resistance increases\nsignificantly with obesity, which may disturb ovulation and increase androgen\nlevels. Some treatments of PCOS with metformin, pioglitazone, and troglitazone have\ndescribed improved ovarian function by managing hyperinsulinemia and insulin\nresistance. Increased sensitivity to gonadotropins due to increased insulin\nsensitivity may lead to spontaneous ovulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, treatments\nthat decrease insulin resistance - such as protocols with metformin - may increase\nthe fertility rates of women with PCOS ( Genazzani et al ., 2004 ; 2007; Motta, 2012 ; Naderpoor et\nal ., 2015 ; De Leo et\nal ., 2003 ; Steiber et al ., 2004 ; Suvarna et al ., 2016 ; Ou et al., 2017 ; Vanella et al ., 2000 ; Pillich et al ., 2005 ).  Carnitine is a quaternary amine synthesized in the body from amino acids lysine and\nmethionine. In living cells, this chemical agent can transfer fatty acids from the\ncytosol to the mitochondria to produce energy from fatty acids. Carnitine is often\nused as a micronutrient and is divided into two types: L-carnitine (active form) and\nD-carnitine (inactive form). L-carnitine plays an important role in glucose\nmetabolism and oxidative stress. L-carnitine can also stabilize the mitochondrial\nmembranes and prevent cell apoptosis ( Ringseis et al ., 2012 ; Ismail et al ., 2014 ; Fenkci et al ., 2008 ). Some authors have looked into the\nrole of carnitine in the treatment of insulin resistance and in the accumulation of\nacetyl coenzyme A. Insulin resistance has been linked to the occurrence of carnitine\ndeficiency during chronic metabolic stress conditions such as diabetes mellitus type\n2 and obesity. Recent studies have reported decreased levels of L-carnitine in\npatients with PCOS and apparently significant correlations between lower levels of\nL-carnitine and greater chances of individuals with PCOS developing hyperinsulinemia\n( Bacurau et al ., 2003 ; W\u00e4chter et al .,\n2002 ; Karlic & Lohninger,\n2004 ; Jamilian et al .,\n2017 ).  This study aimed to assess the effects of L-carnitine on the clinical and laboratory\nparameters and metabolic profiles of individuals with PCOS.    MATERIALS AND METHODS  Eighty women of reproductive age diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria\n( Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus\nWorkshop Group, 2004a , b ) were\nenrolled in the study at the gynecology clinic of the Taleghani Hospital between\n2017 and 2018. All participants gave written consent before joining the study. The\nEthics Committee of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU)\napproved the study. Patients with adrenal deficiency or other endocrine conditions\nand individuals on hormone therapy in the six months prior to the study were\nexcluded.  The women included in the study received L-carnitine 3 g daily (Pursinapharma, Iran)\nfor three months. The patients were not instructed to follow a specific diet or\nintroduce lifestyle changes. Blood samples were taken after overnight fasting at\nbaseline and three months into the study to assess the levels of fasting glucose,\ninsulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein\n(LDL), free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and the insulin resistance\nindex (HOMA-IR). The patients were weighed before and after treatment and had their\nbody mass index (BMI) calculated. The HOMA index was calculated as [baseline\nglucose] x [baseline insulin]/22.5. Menstrual cycles and manifestations of hirsutism\nwere also assessed.  Sample size was determined after consideration for type 1 statistical error <5%\nand type 2 statistical error <20%. Results were shown as mean values plus or\nminus SD (Standard Deviation). Statistical analysis was performed using statistical\nsoftware package SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value\nof 0.05 was considered significant.    RESULTS  Eighty patients with PCOS who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.\nSix participants were lost during the study.  Data are shown as mean values \u00b1 SD. Table\n1 provides a summary of baseline characteristics and results after three\nmonths of treatment. There were significant decreases in the levels of fasting\nglucose, insulin, triglycerides, LDL, and in the BMI and HOMA index. There was a\nsignificant increase in the level of HDL. Regular menstrual cycles were reported by\n48.6% and 61.1% of the patients before and after treatment, respectively. No\nrelevant side effects were reported during and after the treatment.

The management of PCOS may be\nchallenging on account of the comorbidities associated with the disease. Recent\nstudies have focused on the long-term complications of PCOS. Hormonal\ncontraceptives, insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin, thiazolidinediones,\nmyo-inositol, statins, orlistat, and N-acetylcysteine have been prescribed to women\nwith PCOS, but their usage is limited due to side effects.  L-carnitine supplementation has been recently used in obese patients to enhance the\nmetabolic cascade. In the body, L-carnitine is produced in the liver and kidneys and\nstored in the musculoskeletal system, heart, brain, and sperm. L-carnitine\nsupplementation is used to increase energy consumption and reduce lipids and weight\n( Vanella et al ., 2000 ; Pillich et al ., 2005 ; Ringseis et al ., 2012 ; Ismail et al ., 2014 ; Fenkci et al., 2008 ).\nL-carnitine plays an important role in glucose metabolism and oxidative stress.\nAccording to the literature, low serum levels of L-carnitine, even in non-obese\nwomen, may be associated with insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism ( Salehpour et al ., 2016 ; Celik et al ., 2017; Samimi et al ., 2016 ; Ismail et al ., 2014 ).  This study looked into the effects of L-carnitine on the clinical and laboratory\nparameters of women with PCOS. The results showed a significant reduction in the BMI\nand serum levels of TG, LDL, FBS, and insulin, in addition to increased serum HDL\nlevels. Improvement in menstrual cycle regularity was reported without drug-related\nside effects. According to the results, it appears that treatment with L-carnitine\nmay have improved the hormonal and metabolic parameters of women with PCOS.  Ismail et al . (2014) reported\nthat prescribing L-carnitine to clomiphene-resistant patients with PCOS improved the\nquality of ovulation, pregnancy rates, lipid profiles, and the BMI. It has been\nestablished that L-carnitine is safe and may be used to eliminate the long-term\ncomplications of PCOS. The long-term effects of L-carnitine for women with PCOS\nshould be further evaluated. Studies with longer treatment cycles should be\nconducted to confirm the value of this therapy for women with PCOS at risk of\nmetabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disorders.    CONCLUSION  It appears that treatment with L-carnitine may decrease the risk of cardiovascular\nevents by normalizing metabolic profiles and the BMI.  Acronyms:     1. FBS: Fasting blood sugar    2.
