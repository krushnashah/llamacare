    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common gynecological endocrine disorders with a complex pathogenesis ( 1 ). It is characterized by dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, infertility, hairiness, and obesity, all of which seriously affect the physical and mental health of women of childbearing age. PCOS also increases the risk of endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Approximately 5%\u201310% of women of childbearing age are affected by PCOS. Patients with PCOS account for 15%\u201320% of infertility cases ( 2 , 3 ). Studies have shown that abnormal follicular development in patients with PCOS is not only regulated by sex hormones but is also closely related to disorders in the follicular development microenvironment caused by ovarian autocrine/paracrine dysfunction. Recent studies suggested that insulin resistance may initiate PCOS development ( 4 ).  Apelin and chemerin are newly identified adipokines. Apelin is an APJ receptor ligand, is widely expressed in different organs, and plays an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism ( 5 ). Recent studies found that serum apelin levels are significantly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity ( 6 , 7 ). Chemerin, also called TIG2 or RARRES2, is secreted as an 18 kDa precursor protein (chem163s), which can be transformed into a 16 kDa active molecule only after C-terminal cleavage ( 8 ). The precursor protein has multiple restriction sites, which can produce a variety of subtypes upon treatment with different proteases. Chemerin also contributes to adipogenesis, glucose homeostasis, food intake, and body weight and is associated with elevated levels of obesity, diabetes, and cancer ( 9 \u2013 11 ).  Studies have found that serum apelin and chemerin levels in patients with PCOS are significantly increased ( 12 \u2013 15 ), and are potential targets for the treatment of PCOS ( 16 , 17 ). However, other studies showed that the serum apelin and chemerin levels of PCOS patients are lower than those of healthy individuals ( 18 , 19 ). Therefore, the relationship between these adipokines and PCOS remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to statistically evaluate apelin and chemerin levels in patients with PCOS.    Methods   Search design  We searched the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases for potential studies. \u201cPolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d or \u201cPCOS\u201d in combination with the terms \u201capelin\u201d or \u201cchemerin\u201d were used as keywords search titles or abstracts. The full electronic search strategy is provided in the  Supplementary Data Sheet 1  . The publication period examined was between 1990 and 2021. Concurrently, manual retrieval of relevant literature was performed and the references included in clinical trials were consulted to uncover relevant studies that might have been omitted. This review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and following the PRISMA statement. The PRISMA list is provided in the  Supplementary Data Sheet 2  and the PROSPERO registration number is CRD42020218316.    Inclusion criteria  The studies included in this meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) case-controlled or prospective design; (2) detailed data on circulating apelin or chemerin levels in patients with PCOS and healthy controls; and (3) written in English. All the patients with PCOS included in the studies had no medical history or evidence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Patients taking drugs such as insulin-sensitizing drugs, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, anti-androgens, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists within 3 months were also excluded from the study.    Data extraction and risk of bias  Two independent evaluators screened the studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. First, the evaluators read the topic and abstract and eliminated duplicate studies and those who did not meet the inclusion criteria. Next, they read the full text of the documents marked for inclusion and cross-checked the results. Finally, the two reviewers discussed and came to consensus on any publications with objections. If they still could not reach an agreement, a third researcher was invited for further evaluation. For documents with questions or missing data, we contacted the author or corresponding author to obtain as much confirmation or supplemental data as possible. The extracted content of the original publication data included the first author, publication year, study period, region, study design, and details of cases and controls.  The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used as the standard to evaluate the quality of the included literature. The NOS is applicable to the evaluation of cohort and case-controlled studies. It consists of three parts: selection of exposure and control populations, comparability, and evaluation of exposure or outcome. It has eight entries. NOS uses the semi-quantitative principle of a star scale to evaluate the quality of literature with a maximum of nine stars ( 20 , 21 ).    Statistical analysis  Standardized mean differences (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined as the results of the meta-analysis. Cochran\u2019s Q test and I 2 statistics were used to test the heterogeneity among the studies. When I 2 \u2264 50%, there was no heterogeneity and a fixed effects model was used for combined analysis. When I 2 > 50%, there was significant heterogeneity and the random effects model was used for combined analysis. The stability of the meta-analysis results was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis. Low-quality literature was excluded and the impact of a single study on the overall research results was excluded for each study. Begg\u2019s test was used to analyze publication bias. The significance level was set at P < 0.05. Stata 12.0 (College Station, TX, USA) was used for analysis.     Results  A total of 148 articles were initially retrieved, and 18 qualified articles were finally obtained through preliminary screening and quality evaluation ( 5 \u2013 25 ). The publications together contain 1,265 cases and 894 controls ( 12 \u2013 15 , 18 , 19 , 22 \u2013 33 ). The literature retrieval process is shown in  Figure\u00a01  and the baseline data and quality evaluation of the included case-controlled studies are shown in  Table\u00a01  .

Discussion  This systematic review is the first to evaluate circulating apelin and chemerin levels in patients with PCOS. Although most studies have shown that circulating apelin and chemerin levels in patients with PCOS are higher than those in healthy controls, some found that they are lower. In this meta-analysis, 18 independent studies were included and analyzed. We concluded that the circulating chemerin levels in patients with PCOS were significantly higher than those in the healthy controls (SMD: 0.79, 95% CI [0.36, 1.23]), whereas there was no significant association between circulating apelin and PCOS (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI [-0.21, 1.35]).  A 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced rat model was used to simulate the reproductive and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS. These animal experiments showed that recombinant chemerin inhibits basal estradiol secretion in DHT-induced rat granulosa cells. In vitro , chemerin suppressed follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone and estradiol secretion in cultured preantral follicles and granulosa cells ( 34 ). Chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1), an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, is specifically expressed by monocyte-derived dendritic cells, macrophages, and circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Chemerin is a chemoattractant ligand for CMKLR1. CMKLR1 gene deletion attenuates the effects of chronic DHT treatment on ovarian function in mouse models of DHT-induced PCOS, likely via BMP4 signaling ( 35 ). Chemerin also reduces IGF-1-induced steroidogenesis and cell proliferation by decreasing the activation of the IGF-1R signaling pathway in primary human granulosa cells ( 36 ). Additionally, metformin treatment has been shown to significantly reduce serum chemerin levels in PCOS patients ( 32 , 37 ). Chemerin treatment in vitro stimulates the process of angiogenesis ( 38 ). Therefore, Anusha et\u00a0al. hypothesized that the increased expression of ovarian chemerin protein in PCOS subjects may cause derangements in ovarian steroidogenesis or angiogenesis that may trigger the development and progression of metabolism related reproductive disorder ( 39 ). In addition, murine model of polycystic ovaries when treated with pioglitazone and metformin showed improved insulin resistance and abnormal steroid production by attenuating the ovarian chemerin gene expression ( 40 ). These findings suggest that chemerin is a novel negative regulator that may contribute to PCOS pathogenesis. However, further investigation is necessary to understand the effects of chemerin on PCOS.  Although circulating apelin levels are significantly associated with diabetes, in our meta-analysis, there was no significant association between circulating apelin levels and PCOS. Apelin is expressed in granulosa cells, follicles, and follicular fluid and participates in the normal development of follicles, selection of dominant follicles, and proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells ( 41 , 42 ). However, the influence of apelin on PCOS pathogenesis seems to be more complicated, as indicated by controversial data regarding the association between apelin levels, HOMA-IR, and body mass index (BMI) ( 12 , 18 , 22 , 27 ). More high-quality studies are needed to better support the association between apelin and PCOS.  This meta-analysis aimed to statistically evaluate circulating apelin and chemerin levels in PCOS patients. However, this study had some limitations. Due to the lack of large sample case-controlled studies, most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were small. Additionally, some studies did not use BMI-matched healthy controls. Different detection methods for apelin and chemerin were used in these studies. All these factors may have affected the results; therefore, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted cautiously, as further research is needed.    Conclusion  This meta-analysis is the first to evaluate circulating apelin and chemerin levels in PCOS patients. Our findings suggest that circulating chemerin levels in PCOS patients are significantly higher than those in healthy controls. More high-quality studies are needed to better support the association between serum apelin levels and PCOS.
