    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that occurs in women of reproductive age. Anovulation caused by abnormal follicular development is still the main characteristic of PCOS patients with infertile. Granulosa cell (GC) is an important part of the follicular microenvironment, the dysfunction of which can affect follicular development. Increasing evidence indicates that exosomal miRNAs derived from the follicular fluid (FF) of patients play critical roles during PCOS. However, which follicular fluid-derived exosomal miRNAs play a pivotal role in controlling granulosa cell function and consequently follicular development remain largely unknown, as does the underlying mechanism. Herein, we showed that miR-143-3p is highly expressed in the follicular fluid exosomes of patients with PCOS and can be delivered into granulosa cells. Furthermore, functional experiments showed that translocated miR-143-3p promoted granulosa cell apoptosis, which is important in follicle development. Mechanistically, BMPR1A was identified as a direct target of miR-143-3p. Overexpression of BMPR1A reversed the effects of exosomal miR-143-3p on GC apoptosis and proliferation by activating the Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that miR-143-3p-containing exosomes derived from PCOS follicular fluid promoted granulosa cell apoptosis by targeting BMPR1A and blocking the Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. Our findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the roles of exosomal-miRNAs in the follicular fluid of PCOS patients and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for PCOS.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by chronic anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperandrogenism 1 , 2 . The etiology is complex, and the pathogenesis remains unclear. However, previous studies revealed that PCOS patients exhibit abnormal follicular development, which is the main cause of anovulatory infertility 3 .  The follicular microenvironment is essential for follicular development, oocyte maturation and quality 4 . It has been reported that the oocyte and surrounding granulosa cells (GCs) display an interdependent relationship in the stage of follicle development via direct gap junctions. It was also found that there was nutrient exchange and biological signal transmission between GCs and oocytes in the follicular fluid microenvironment through paracrine or autocrine manners, which regulated the growth, development and maturation of follicles 5 , 6 . Thus, the dysregulation of GCs affects the ovarian follicular microenvironment, which might impair folliculogenesis and subsequently lead to poor reproductive outcome in patients with PCOS. Therefore, exploring the function of GCs can explain the abnormal follicular development of patients with PCOS. Previous studies have reported that GC apoptosis affects follicle development, oocyte growth and maturation and triggers follicular atresia during the early phase of follicular development 7 . Increasing evidence indicates that the apoptosis of GCs in PCOS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls 8 , 9 . However, the underlying mechanism of abnormal apoptosis of GCs involved in the process of abnormal follicular development in PCOS remains unclear.  Follicular fluid is the critical microenvironment for follicular development and contains a wide variety of biologically active molecules, including exosomes that have a lipid bilayer membrane structure with a diameter of 30\u2013150 nm 10 . Exosomes contain cell-specific proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that act as carriers passes biological information into target cells 11 . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (21\u201324 nucleotides), single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules that can regulate target gene expression by binding to the 3\u2019 untranslated regions (3\u2019 UTRs) of target gene mRNAs to silence these genes at post transcriptional level 12 . A growing number of studies report that follicular fluid and exosomes derived from the follicular fluid of PCOS patients (PCOS-FF exosomes) have many differentially expressed nucleic acids, especially miRNAs 13 \u2013 15 . However, the effect of FF-exosomal miRNAs on follicular development in patients with PCOS remains unclear.  In the present study, we mainly focused on exosomal-miR-143-3p and explored the effect of PCOS-FF derived exosomal-miR-143-3p on the apoptosis and proliferation of ovarian GCs and then analysed the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in follicular dysplasia in PCOS. Our findings will hopefully provide perspectives to understand the progression of PCOS.    Results   Comparison of clinical general information, laboratory data and apoptosis related indexes of granulosa cells between PCOS and normal controls  A total of 146 patients were enrolled in this study, including 80 healthy controls and 66 PCOS patients. As shown in Table 1 , there were no substantial differences in patient age, infertility years, basal levels of E2 or prolactin (PRL) or days of stimulation between the two groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Body mass index (BMI), basal levels of LH and testosterone (T) and antral follicle count (AFC) in the PCOS group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, the basal levels of FSH and the Gn dosage (IU) were significantly lower in the PCOS group than in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Laboratory data analysis indicated that the number of retrieved oocytes increased significantly, while the MII oocyte rate, 2PN fertilization rate and high-quality embryo rate in the PCOS group decreased significantly compared with those in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Consistently, we found that the pro-apoptotic gene Bax mRNA levels were significantly increased, and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in primary GCs in the PCOS group compared with the healthy control group (Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

Isolation and characterization of follicular fluid-derived exosomes  Exosomes derived from the FF of healthy control group and patients with PCOS were isolated and characterized. TEM analysis revealed that exosomes derived from the FF of patients with PCOS were round membrane-bound vesicles with a diameter of 30\u2013150\u00a0nm, which was consistent with exosomes from controls (Fig. 1 A). Western blotting showed that the exosome marker proteins TSG101 and HSP70 were enriched in these exosomes, as expected (Fig. 1 B). To further confirm whether FF-exosomes can be taken up by primary GCs or KGN cells, we labeled the FF-exosomes with PKH67 fluorescent dye and then coincubated them with primary GCs or KGN cells for 12\u00a0h. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the PKH67-labeled exosomes were efficiently absorbed by primary GCs or KGN cells and transferred to the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 1 C,D). Overall, these results indicate that FF-exosomes can be successfully isolated and internalized by primary GCs or KGN cells. Figure 1 Isolation and identification of exosomes derived from human follicular fluids.

(C) Detection of FF-exosome uptake by primary GCs or KGN cells in vitro. Granulosa cells were incubated with PKH67-labeled exosomes for 12\u00a0h (PKH67 is shown in green, nuclei were stained with DAPI).     PCOS-FF derived exosomes promote granulosa cell apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in vitro  To determine the functional role of PCOS-FF derived exosomes on GC apoptosis and proliferation, we cultured primary granulosa cells and KGN cells with normal-FF derived exosomes and PCOS-FF derived exosomes for 48\u00a0h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 A,B, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the pro-apoptosis gene Bax were upregulated in GCs exposed to PCOS-FF derived exosomes, while the mRNA and protein expression levels of the anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2 were downregulated in GCs exposed to PCOS-FF derived exosomes. As expected, the apoptotic rates of primary GCs and KGN cells were significantly enhanced in the PCOS-FF derived exosome- treated group, as determined by PE Annexin V assay (Fig. 2 C,D). We further evaluated the effects of PCOS-FF derived exosomes on granulosa cell proliferation in vitro via a CCK8 assay. PCOS-FF derived exosome treatment significantly inhibited the growth capacity of primary GCs and KGN cells compared with PBS and normal-FF derived exosome treatment (Fig. 2 E,F). Taken together, our findings show that PCOS-FF derived exosomes promote apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of granulosa cells.

Thus, we hypothesized that PCOS-FF-exosomes might enhance apoptosis of granulosa cells by transferring specific miRNAs. Hence, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs in follicular fluid derived exosomes between the normal population and patients with PCOS according to the GRA001999 database of the National Genomics Data Center and found that miR-143-3p was enriched in exosomes of PCOS-FF, and the result was confirmed by the expression levels of miR-143-3p in normal-FF-exosomes and PCOS-FF-exosomes as detected by qRT\u2013PCR analysis (Fig. 3 A,B). In addition, miR-143-3p levels were significantly increased in primary granulosa cells and KGN cells treated with PCOS-FF- exosomes compared with PBS and normal-FF- exosomes (Fig. 3 C,D). Thus, our results suggest that miR-143-3p is enriched in PCOS-FF derived exosomes. Figure 3 miR-143-3p is enriched in PCOS-FF derived exosomes but not in normal-FF derived exosomes.

Exosomal-miR-143-3p promotes granulosa cell apoptosis and suppresses proliferation in vitro  To further clarify the biological roles of miR-143-3p in granulosa cell apoptosis and proliferation, miR-143-3p mimic or inhibitor were transfected into KGN cells. As expected, miR-143-3p mimic significantly increased miR-143-3p expression, while miR-143-3p inhibitor decreased its expression in KGN cells (Fig. 4 A). Western blotting results revealed that the protein levels of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax were significantly increased by miR-143-3p mimic transfection and decreased by miR-143-3p inhibitor transfection. However, the protein levels of the anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2 were significantly decreased by miR-143-3p mimic transfection and increased by miR-143-3p inhibitor transfection. (Fig. 4 B). Cell apoptosis assays showed that miR-143-3p overexpression significantly promoted cell apoptosis, whereas miR-143-3p inhibition showed an anti-apoptotic phenotype (Fig. 4 C,D). Additionally, the CCK8 assay showed that miR-143-3p overexpression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, while miR-143-3p inhibition enhanced cell proliferation (Fig. 4 E,F). These results reveal that PCOS-FF derived exosomal miR-143-3p plays a crucial role in enhancing granulosa cell apoptosis and reducing proliferation.

BMPR1A is a direct target gene of miR-143-3p  To further elucidate the mechanism underlying miR-143-3p affecting granulosa cell function, we searched for miR-143-3p target genes using online bioinformatics prediction software (TargetScan Human7.2). The results demonstrated that a binding sequence of miR-143-3p was found in the 3\u2019UTR of BMPR1A (Fig. 5 A). BMPR1A is a bone morphogenetic protein receptor activin-like kinase and a key signaling molecule in the BMP signaling pathway that plays a key role in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and other cell processes 20 , 21 . Thus, we speculated that BMPR1A may be a direct target gene of miR-143-3p. We detected the mRNA expression of BMPR1A in GCs between control and PCOS patients, the result showed that the mRNA expression of BMPR1A in primary GCs of patients with PCOS were lower than in controls (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Subsequently, a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to verify their interaction. PGL-3-BMPR1A-wt plasmids and PGL-3-BMPR1A-mut plasmids were constructed and cotransfected with miR-143-3p mimic into KGN cells. The results showed that luciferase activity was reduced in KGN cells cotransfected with miR-143-3p mimic and wild-type BMPR1A 3\u2019UTR reporter, while no luciferase activity change was found in KGN cells cotransfected with miR-143-3p mimic and mutant BMPR1A 3\u2019UTR reporter (Fig. 5 B). Figure 5 BMPR1A is a direct target gene of miR-143-3p. (A) The binding site of miR-143-3p on the BMPR1A gene was predicted by TargetScan Human 7.2. The wild-type BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR (BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR-wt) and mutant BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR (BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR-mut) were used to construct recombinant plasmids for dual luciferase reporter assays. wt, wild type; mut, mutant; UTR: untranslated region. (B) The relative luciferase activity was measured following cotransfection of miR-143-3p mimic with plasmids encoding BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR-wt or BMPR1A-3\u2019UTR-mut into KGN cells. The Renilla luciferase activities were normalized to firefly luciferase activities.

(D) Western blotting analysis of BMPR1A protein expression in KGN cells transfected with miR-143-3p mimic or inhibitor. Original blots/gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. S6 . ns no significance, * P <\u20090.05, ** P <\u20090.01, *** P <\u20090.001. All results are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.   To investigate the relationship between BMPR1A and miR-143-3p, we examined BMPR1A mRNA and protein expression in KGN cells transfected with the miR-143-3p mimic or inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 5 C,D, the mRNA and protein expression of BMPR1A were decreased by miR-143-3p mimic transfection and increased by miR-143-3p inhibitor transfection. These data indicate that BMPR1A is a direct target of miR-143-3p.    BMPR1A overexpression attenuates the effects of miR-143-3p on cell apoptosis and proliferation in KGN cells  To explore whether BMPR1A was involved in the regulation of miR-143-3p on cell phenotype, we cotransfected miR-143-3p mimic and pcDNA-BMPR1A plasmid in KGN cells. Cell apoptosis and CCK8 assays indicated that the combined transfection of miR-143-3p mimic and BMPR1A expression plasmid inhibited cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation compared with miR-143-3p mimic transfection alone (Fig. 6 A,B). These data suggest that BMPR1A mediates the role of miR-143-3p in promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in KGN cells. Figure 6 miR-143-3p promotes cell apoptosis and suppresses cell proliferation by inhibiting the BMPR1A/Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway.

Original blots/gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. S7. ns no significance, * P <\u20090.05, ** P <\u20090.01, *** P <\u20090.001. All results are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.     The Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of exosomal miR-143-3p on cell apoptosis and proliferation  Previous studies have shown that Smad1/5/8 are BMPR1A downstream signaling molecules that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis 22 . Next, we detected whether the downregulation of BMPR1A by miR-143-3p affected downstream signals, including Smad1/5/8 and its phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6 C, overexpression of miR-143-3p significantly decreased the activity of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, accompanied by an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Nevertheless, cotreatment with miR-143-3p mimic and BMPR1A expression plasmid could rescue the expression of p-Smad1/5/8 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 compared to miR-143-3p mimic alone. Moreover, overexpression of BMPR1A inhibited the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax triggered by miR-143-3p. These results suggest that the BMPR1A/Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway mediates the role of miR-143-3p on cell apoptosis and proliferation in KGN cells.     Discussion  Follicular fluid provides an important microenvironment for follicular development and oocyte maturation. The major components of follicular fluid are proteins, hormones, amino acids and metabolites 23 . Follicular fluid exosomes are new components in follicular fluid. It can deliver miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins involved in follicular development and oocyte maturation 24 , 25 . Previous studies have shown that miRNAs in exosomes derived from human follicular fluid play key roles in steroidogenesis and are closely associated with PCOS 26 , 27 . However, the mechanism of follicular fluid exosomal miRNAs in the pathological process of PCOS, especially in follicular development, is unclear.  In this study, FF-derived exosomes were isolated and characterized from patients with PCOS and healthy controls. We further identified the miRNA expression profiles in the exosomes derived from follicular fluid of PCOS and healthy control patients. Small RNA sequencing analysis showed that 20 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the PCOS FF-exosomes and the control group according to the GRA001999 database of the National Genomics Data Center, among which miR-143-3p was enriched in PCOS-FF exosomes. Additionally, some studies have shown that miR-143-3p is involved in cell apoptosis 28 , 29 . Thus, we speculated that PCOS-FF exosomes might affect the apoptosis of granulosa cells by transferring miR-143-3p. In the present study, we found that overexpression of miR-143-3p significantly enhanced the apoptosis rate of GCs, accompanied by the inhibition of cell proliferation. Therefore, it is suggested that exosomal miR-143-3p in PCOS follicular fluid may play an important role in PCOS follicular dysplasia by affecting the biological functions of GCs.  Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily. Their biological effects are mediated by BMP-specific type I (BMPR1A and BMPR1B) and type II (BMPR2) serine/threonine kinase receptors as well as SMAD-related proteins 30 . BMPs are required for normal folliculogenesis in the ovary by regulating several key biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis 21 , 31 \u2013 33 . Thus, it is suggested that disruption of BMP/Smad signaling may be involved in folliculogenesis disorders. However, whether exosomal miR-143-3p regulates the function of granulosa cells by controlling BMPs or BMP receptors is still unclear. In this study, BMPR1A was predicted as a potential target of miR-143-3p by bioinformatics analysis, and luciferase reporter assays further verified the direct binding of miR-143-3p in the 3\u2019UTR of BMPR1A in KGN cells. We further demonstrated that miR-143-3p promoted apoptosis and suppressed proliferation of KGN cells by directly targeting BMPR1A. BMPR1A mediates the miR-143-3p-regulated promotion of apoptosis and suppression of proliferation in granulosa cells. We also found that miR-143-3p-mediated cell apoptosis and proliferation in KGN cells were related to the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8.  In conclusion, our research revealed for the first time that miR-143-3p-containing exosomes derived from PCOS follicular fluid promote granulosa cell apoptosis by targeting BMPR1A and blocking the Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. Therefore, these findings provide novel insights into GC dysfunction in PCOS and suggest that exosomal-miR-143-3p derived from follicular fluid of PCOS patients may be a promising molecular target for the treatment of PCOS.    Methods   Clinical samples, ovarian stimulation  The clinical samples were obtained from 66 patients with PCOS and 80 healthy controls undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the Department of Reproductive Medicine Center, the Fourth of Shijiazhuang Maternity Hospital between April 2020 and September 2021. PCOS was diagnosed in strict accordance with the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, excluding Cushing\u2019s syndrome, androgen secreting tumors, thyroid dysfunction, endometriosis, hyperprolactinemia and other endocrine diseases. All analyses performed in studies involving human samples were approved by the Clinical Ethics Review Board of the Obstetrics and\u00a0Gynecology Hospital of Shijiazhuang (approval number: 20210080). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulatory methods section. All participants signed informed consent forms. Additionally, this study was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.  Follicular fluid (FF) was obtained from PCOS and healthy patients who underwent IVF-ET by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). On the second or third days of menstruation, a GnRH agonist (Ferring, Germany) was used, with the initial dose depending on the patient\u2019s age, body mass index (BMI), basal hormone levels, and antral follicle count (AFC). After approximately 28\u00a0days, when the downregulation criteria were FSH\u2009<\u20095 mIU/mL, LH\u2009<\u20095 mIU/mL, E2\u2009<\u200950\u00a0pg/mL, AFC approximately 5\u00a0mm and endometrial thickness\u2009<\u20095\u00a0mm, Gn was subcutaneously injected until the hCG day, and oocyte retrieval was performed by transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration after 36\u00a0h of hCG trigger.    Isolation and identification of follicular fluid exosomes  Exosomes were isolated from healthy control patients (female tubal factors) and PCOS patients\u2019 follicular fluids using the exoEasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Finally, the pellets containing exosomes were resuspended in XE buffer. The exosome protein content was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce\u2122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and the absorbance measured at 562\u00a0nm was used to reflect the exosome protein concentration. Finally, freshly prepared exosomes were immediately used for experiments or were frozen at\u2009\u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C for further experimentation.  Characterization of FF-exosomes was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM): 5\u201310 \u03bcL exosomes were dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids at room temperature for 3\u20135\u00a0min, and then absorbed the excess liquid with absorbent paper. Then, 10 \u03bcL of 2% phosphotungstic acid was pipetted onto the grids for staining for 2\u20133\u00a0min, the excess fluid was removed, and the grid was dried at room temperature. Finally, the copper grid was detected under TEM at 80\u00a0kV (HITACHI). The exosome -specific marker TSG101 and EV-associated protein marker HSP70 were analysed by Western blotting.    Isolation and culture of granulosa cells from follicular fluids  On the day of oocyte retrieval, the first tube of serum-free follicular fluid was collected, and then centrifuged at 2000 g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for further experiments. The cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1:1 added Ficoll solution, and then centrifuged for 15\u00a0min at 1500 g . The cells at the interface were removed and washed twice with PBS, and the cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL streptomycin at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 cell culture incubator.    Exosome uptake assay  The purified exosomes were labeled with a PKH67 green Fluorescent Cell Liner Kit (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 20\u00a0\u03bcg exosome-XE was added to 0.5\u00a0mL Dilution C, and 1 \u03bcL PKH67 was added to 0.5\u00a0mL Dilution C and then fully mixed and incubated with each other at room temperature for 3\u00a0min. Then, 1\u00a0mL 1% bovine serum albumin was added to neutralize the excess dye. Then, exosome-PKH67 was extracted with an exoEasy Maxi Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen, Germany). The labeled exosomes were then coincubated with 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 4 primary GCs or 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 4 KGN cells for 12\u00a0h. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10\u00a0min and washed twice with PBS, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. Finally, the signal was observed under confocal microscope.    RNA extraction, reverse transcription and RT-PCR analysis  Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and then 1\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The exosomal RNA was extracted using the exoRNeasy Serum/Plasma Starter Kit (Qiagen, Germany). miRNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA by Bulge-Loop\u2122 miRNA RT Primer (RiboBio Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China). U6 small nuclear RNA was used as the internal reference for miRNAs. Ct values were indicated by using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.  To quantify the mRNA expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2, we used oligo d(T) 18 primers to reverse transcribe total RNA into cDNA. Then, qRT\u2013PCR was performed by using SYBR Green dye and specific primers for Bax, Bcl-2 and \u03b2-actin. The primer sequences we used are listed in Table S1 .    Western blotting  SDS lysis buffer freshly mixed with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Cambridge, MA) was used to isolate proteins from cells. Western blotting assays were performed as described previously 34 . All the antibodies we used are listed in Table S2 .    miR-143-3p mimic and inhibitor transfection  The human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line KGN was transiently transfected with 50\u00a0nM miR-143-3p mimic, mimic NC, 100\u00a0nM miR-143-3p inhibitor and inhibitor NC according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) for 24\u00a0h or 48\u00a0h.    Apoptosis and proliferation assay  Cell apoptosis Assays were conducted as described in the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were pretreated with exosomes or miR-143-3p mimic or inhibitor (RiboBio Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), and 48\u00a0h after treatment, the cells were collected and diluted to a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 5 , which was resuspended in binding buffer. Then, 5 \u03bcL of PE Annexin V and 7-AAD were introduced. The cells were incubated at room temperature in darkness for 15\u00a0min. Apoptotic cells were observed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).  The cell proliferation assay was conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. KGN cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5000 cells/well. After 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h of incubation, the cells were incubated with a 10\u00a0\u03bcl Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) (Yeasen\u00a0Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) for another 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 cell culture incubator. Finally, the absorbance at 450\u00a0nm was measured by microplate reader.    Vector construction and dual-luciferase reporter assay  MiRNAs that target BMPR1A were predicted by the online software program TargetScan Human 7.2. The full-length 3\u2019UTR BMPR1A containing the predicted wild-type or mut-type miR-143-3p binding sites was amplified by PCR and then cloned into the PGL3-Basic reporter vector. PGL-3-BMPR1A-wt plasmids and PGL-3-BMPR1A-mut plasmids were cotransfected with miR-143-3p mimic into KGN cells along with the pRL-TK vector using Lipo2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 24\u00a0h of transfection, luciferase activity was determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and Renilla luciferase activity was used for normalization.    Statistical analysis  All experiments were performed in the study as least two independent times each in duplicate. The measured data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard\u00a0deviation. Clinical data were analysed by SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0. The differences in statistical significance between different treatments were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.    Ethics declaration  The study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Review Board of the Obstetrics and\u00a0Gynecology Hospital of Shijiazhuang (Hebei, China), ethical approval number: 20210080.
