Not only do PCOS women of reproductive ages show an increase in cardiometabolic biomarkers,  4  but adolescents and postmenopausal women with PCOS also observe an increase in unfavorable cardiometabolic biomarkers, such as hypertension and DM.  4  ,  10  PCOS women with high cardiometabolic risk should be identified at an early age to prevent cardiovascular events as early as possible.  Polycystic ovary syndrome women usually experience irregular and long menstrual cycles since puberty. According to many epidemiological studies, women with a history of irregular menstruation have increased risks of cardiometabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, DM, and coronary heart disease, compared with women with regular menstrual cycles.  9  ,  11  ,  12  ,  13  Recently, the association between the severity of menstrual cyclicity and hyperinsulinemia and IR has been demonstrated, which suggested that menstrual history may be a simple but clinically important marker of metabolic dysfunction risk.  14  ,  15  These findings provide an opportunity for risk factor intervention for the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases. However, evidence linking the severity of menstrual cyclicity with cardiometabolic risk in PCOS women is scarce.  In this work, we hypothesized that the severity of menstrual dysfunction is associated with cardiometabolic risk in women with PCOS. To test this hypothesis, we systematically analyzed the association of menstrual cycle regularity and cardiometabolic risk markers including obesity, glycemic abnormalities, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome.    2  MATERIAL AND METHODS   2.1  Participants  This prospective cross\u2010sectional study was carried out in the Reproductive Medicine Center, Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Shunde). All participants between 18 and 40\u2009years old with a diagnosis of PCOS from July 2021 to September 2022 were screened. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam definition in which two of the three criteria should be met  16  : oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, clinical hyperandrogenism (a modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey hirsutism score >6, presence of androgenic alopecia and acne) or biochemical hyperandrogenism (serum total testosterone \u22652.63\u2009nmol/L based on the normal range from the Department of Clinical Laboratory of the Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University [The First People's Hospital of Shunde]) and characteristic ultrasound image of polycystic ovaries (at least one ovary containing 12 or more peripheral follicles measuring 2\u20139\u2009mm in diameter and/or ovarian volume of at least 10\u2009mL) on transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound.  17  The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) pregnancy or lactation state; (ii) a history of hyperandrogenic states (such as non\u2010classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen\u2010secreting tumors, Cushing's syndrome or 21\u2010hydroxylase deficiency); (iii) use of any hormonal medication (including oral contraceptives, insulin\u2010sensitizing agents, antidiabetic medications, antiandrogens, or glucocorticoids) for at least 3\u2009months preceding the evaluation; and (iv) previous use of any blood pressure\u2010lowering medication or lipid\u2010regulating medication. All participants had normal thyroid\u2010stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin levels.    2.2  Protocol  All participants completed a uniform questionnaire providing data regarding age, race, age of menarche, duration of the menstrual cycle, and a detailed menstrual cycle history, including number of menses per year, history of medication, and other sociodemographic information, which were further reviewed at consultation. The detailed menstrual cycle record was shown on the app of the participants' telephone or by recalling it.  The anthropometric measurements included height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, and hip circumference. Standing height and body weight were measured to the nearest 0.5\u2009cm and 0.1\u2009kg, respectively, by using a calibrated scale without shoes and heavy clothes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, and hip circumference was measured over the widest portion of the gluteal and greater trochanteric region. Waist\u2010to\u2010hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference (cm)/hip circumference (cm). Participants' arterial blood pressure was measured at the first visit when the woman came to the hospital after sitting for at least 15\u2009min. A well\u2010trained nurse took two blood pressure measurements using an OMRON electronic sphygmomanometer (Omron Healthcare Co. Ltd., Japan) at an interval of at least 30\u2009min, and the calculated mean values were used. Polycystic ovarian morphology was assessed by either transvaginal ultrasonography or abdominal ultrasonography (Aloka F\u201037 Ultrasound System with 8\u2009MHz endovaginal transducer; Hitachi High\u2010Tech Co., Japan).  Fasting blood samples were obtained in the morning after a 12\u2010h overnight fast and used to measure hormonal and metabolic parameters. Participants were generally tested for basal follicle\u2010stimulating hormone (FSH), basal luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), basal prolactin (PRL), total testosterone (TT), sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG), total cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL\u2010C), low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), triglyceride, TSH, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). An oral glucose tolerance test (75\u2009g of glucose) was performed, and glycemia and insulinemia were measured at 0 and 120\u2009min, respectively. Screening for Cushing's syndrome and androgen\u2010secreting neoplasms was performed when clinically indicated during follow\u2010up.  According to the WHO criteria, BMI of 25.0\u201329.9, 30.0\u201334.9, 35.0\u201339.9, and >40.0\u201350.0\u2009kg/m 2 are diagnosed as overweight, obese I, obese II, and obese III, respectively. Free androgen index (FAI) was calculated as the ratio of total testosterone levels in nmol/L to SHBG levels in nmol/L\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 (%).  18  Non\u2010high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (non\u2010HDL\u2010C) was calculated as total cholesterol\u2009\u2212\u2009HDL\u2010C. Lipoprotein lipid levels were classified as follows: high non\u2010HDL\u2010C: \u22654.9\u2009mmol/L, high LDL\u2010C: \u22654.1\u2009mmol/L, low HDL\u2010C (women): <1.25\u2009mmol/L and high triglyceride: \u22652.3\u2009mmol/L.  19  Prediabetes was defined by the presence of impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose between 5.6 and 6.9\u2009mmol/L) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (2\u2009h plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance test between 7.8 and 11.0\u2009mmol/L), and DM was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria.  20  Homeostasis model assessment\u2013insulin resistance (HOMA\u2013IR) was calculated using the following formula where fasting insulin levels are expressed in \u03bcIU/mL and fasting glucose is expressed in mmol/L: HOMA\u2010IR\u2009=\u2009fasting insulin\u2009\u00d7\u2009fasting glucose/22.5. Participants were considered as having IR when the HOMA\u2010IR index was \u22652.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22126 mol\u2009\u00d7\u2009U/L 2 .  21  According to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed when meeting three of the following five components: central obesity (women >88\u2009cm), high blood pressure (\u2265130/\u226585\u2009mmHg), raised triglycerides (\u22651.7\u2009mmol/L), low HDL\u2010cholesterol (women <1.3\u2009mmol/L), and fasting hyperglycemia (diabetes or fasting glucose \u22656.1\u2009mmol/L).  22    Participants diagnosed with PCOS were stratified into groups according to the interval between episodes of vaginal bleeding. Women with 26\u201334\u2009days of bleeding intervals were considered eumenorrheic (eumeno). Oligomenorrhea (oligo) was defined as bleeding intervals within 35\u2009days to 3\u2009months, whereas amenorrhea (ameno) was defined as bleeding intervals >3\u2009months per year.  15  ,  23      2.3  Laboratory measurements  All biochemical measurements were tested in the Department of Clinical Laboratory of the Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Shunde). FSH, LH, E2, P, PRL, TT, and SHBG were measured using automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System; Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). The intra\u2010 and inter\u2010assay coefficients of variation were <4.3% and 5.6% for FSH, <5.4% and 6.4% for LH, <7.7% and 4.7% for E2, <9.19% and 9.57% for P, <3.93% and 7.08% for TT, <1.61% and 6.92% for PRL, and <4.8% and 5.5% for SHBG, respectively. Plasma glucose concentration was determined by the hexokinase method (Beckman Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Serum insulin concentration was determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay analysis (Insulin Test; Mindray Biomedical Co., Ltd., China). The total coefficient of variation was <10%. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL\u2010C, and LDL\u2010C were measured by an enzymatic method using commercial kits (Zybio, Inc., China). The total coefficient of variation was <10%. TSH, fT3, and fT4 were measured by automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The total coefficient of variation was <8%.    2.4  Statistical methods  The baseline characteristics and clinical indicators were described as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD for continuous variables and as frequency with proportion for categorical variables. For continuous variables, mean intergroup differences were evaluated using one\u2010way ANOVA (with Bonferroni multiple\u2010comparison test) when the homogeneity of variance assumption was met; otherwise, Welch's test was used (with Tamhane's multiple\u2010comparison test). For categorical variables, Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test was used, as appropriate. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) or adjusted OR and 95% confidence interval (CI) of menstrual cyclicity for the prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia in different models with adjustment for potential confounding factors. No variables were adjusted in model 1; age, BMI, and waist circumference were adjusted in model 2; age, BMI, waist circumference, and FAI were further adjusted in model 3. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS v26.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), with p <\u20090.05 considered statistically significant. A power analysis was not performed before starting the study, but a post hoc power calculation was conducted for the observed dataset with R code, with an alpha of 0.05 and the actual values of prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia based on the results of the study. The study demonstrated 94%, 96%, and 96% powers to detect any difference in the prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia in the population, respectively.     3  RESULTS  In total, 189 consecutive PCOS women were screened, of which 35 (22.7%) were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria of the study (5 women with polymenorrhea, 7 women without serum hormone measurement, 6 women with hyperprolactinemia, 4 women with hyperthyreosis, and 13 women with hormonal medication history within 3\u2009months preceding the evaluation). Of the 154 participants finally enrolled during this prospective cross\u2010sectional study, 121 participants used the app to record their periods, and 33 participants responded to their periods by recalling it. Finally, 24 (15.6%) participants were in the eumeno group, 73 (47.4%) participants were in the oligo group, and 57 (37.0%) participants were in the ameno group.  None of the enrolled participants were alcoholics or smokers. The basic demographic, anthropometric, and endocrine characteristics of the PCOS women are found in Table 1 . We found no difference in the mean age, BMI, waist circumference, and waist\u2010to\u2010height ratio among the three groups. Basal FSH, LH, E2, P, TT, and FAI were similar among the three groups.

The metabolic characteristics of PCOS women with different menstrual cycles are shown in Table 2 . In the eumeno, oligo, and ameno groups, the prevalence rates of IR were 50.0%, 61.6%, and 73.7%, respectively, and the prevalence rates of prediabetes were 12.5%, 27.4%, and 42.1%, respectively. A significantly higher prevalence of IR and prediabetes was demonstrated in the ameno group than in the eumeno group (Figure 1A,B ). The proportion of dyslipidemia including high non\u2010HDL\u2010C, low HDL\u2010C, high LDL\u2010C, and high triglyceride in the eumeno, oligo, and ameno groups was 45.8%, 45.2%, and 64.9%, respectively, and the proportion of dyslipidemia in the ameno group was significantly higher than that in the oligo group (Figure 1C ). The difference in the proportion of high non\u2010HDL\u2010C, low HDL\u2010C, high LDL\u2010C, and high triglyceride was observed among the three groups, but the difference was not significant. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the eumeno, oligo, and ameno groups was 8.3%, 17.8%, and 26.3%, respectively (Figure 1D ). In total, a trend toward an increase in unfavorable cardiometabolic risk markers including obesity, hypertension, prevalence of IR, prediabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome was observed in the ameno group than in the other groups (Table 2 ; Figure 1 ).

To further identify the association of the severity of menstrual dysfunction with the prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia, we performed binary logistic regression analysis (Table 3 ). In model 1 without adjustment for any confounding factors, ameno women were more likely to have (1) a higher prevalence of IR than eumeno women (OR: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.04\u20137.57); (2) a higher prevalence of prediabetes than eumeno women (OR: 5.09; 95% CI: 1.36\u201319.04) and (3) a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia than oligo women (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.10\u20134.58). Moreover, the prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia was still significantly higher in the ameno group than in the oligo or eumeno group when adjusted for age, BMI, and waist circumference in model 2. When we further adjusted for FAI in model 3 during binary logistic regression analysis, a higher prevalence of IR (OR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.03\u20138.81) and prediabetes (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: 1.01\u201315.40) was observed in the ameno group than in the eumeno group, and a higher proportion of dyslipidemia (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.16\u20135.15) was observed in the ameno group than in the oligo group.

These results highlight the value of amenorrhea as a marker for the identification of PCOS women at greatest risk of cardiometabolic diseases.  Our study demonstrated that PCOS women exhibiting amenorrhea had a threefold higher prevalence of IR than PCOS women with eumenorrhea, which was consistent with previous studies.  14  ,  15  As IR and hyperinsulinemia are closely associated,  24  many studies have found that hyperinsulinemia has an adverse impact on the development of PCOS and the severity of menstrual dysfunction. Chronic hyperinsulinemia has been shown to disrupt ovarian follicular development as insulin is an important regulator of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis.  25  Some studies found that insulin stimulates ovaries to increase androgen production and inhibit sex hormone\u2010binding globulin production in women,  25  ,  26  ,  27  which further exacerbates IR and can lead to an increased prevalence of PCOS in women with type 1 diabetes.  25  ,  27  ,  28  An animal study indicated that chronic hyperinsulinemia uncouples insulin\u2010mediated regulation of glucose transporter\u20104 and the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoXO1) transcription factor, contributing to the state of selective IR.  29  Furthermore, some reports showed that reduction in hyperinsulinemia with lifestyle modification, insulin\u2010sensitizing agents, or bariatric surgery can enhance ovulation and restore menstrual cyclicity.  30  ,  31  All these findings further confirmed the relationship between the severity of menstrual dysfunction and IR.  The prevalence of IR in our study was high even though the women included were young. Gulli et\u00a0al.'s study showed that severe IR preceding or accompanied by hyperinsulinemia can be detected long before the development of DM,  32  so increasing evidence indicated that postprandial hyperinsulinemia and IR may be the basic causes of many cardiometabolic diseases, including obesity, DM, and coronary heart disease.  24  ,  33  ,  34  As a result, as menstrual dysfunction becomes severe, the prevalence of IR increases, leading to an increase in unfavorable cardiometabolic risk markers including obesity, hypertension, prediabetes, dyslipidemia, and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the ameno group in our study.  Estrogen has been shown to participate in central and peripheral regulation in glucose homeostasis,  35  ,  36  and estrogen deficiency can accelerate the development of IR, DM, and other metabolic diseases. Many epidemiological studies have found a strong correlation between estrogen deficiency and cardiometabolic diseases.  37  ,  38  Thus, we speculated that the increased risk of unfavorable cardiometabolic markers in the ameno group was probably caused by the high prevalence of IR and the long period of low serum levels of estradiol.  When assessing the cardiometabolic risk in PCOS women, they usually need to undergo lipid screening, blood glucose tests, and other tests, which brings a huge burden for primary care facilities in low\u2010resource settings. In our study, the menstrual cycle was identified as a simple, non\u2010invasive, and promising potential marker for cardiometabolic diseases, which would be helpful to refine the indications for the screening of cardiometabolic diseases in PCOS women. Our results emphasize the importance of regular menstruation for overall health status in PCOS women. Many other studies also demonstrated that women with PCOS already have an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk such as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome in early adulthood compared with the normal population.  39  ,  40  Clinicians and primary care providers should emphasize the risks and complications of long\u2010term oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in PCOS women. In addition, treatment strategies including lifestyle modification, hormone replacement therapy, insulin\u2010sensitizing agents, and even bariatric surgery should be adopted as soon as possible to help restore regular menstruation among PCOS women. Our study was limited by its retrospective design and cross\u2010sectional nature. Moreover, the question related to cycle regularity relied on some participants' interpretation of \u201cirregular.\u201d Although we acquired the detailed menstrual cycle history and further reviewed it at consultation, some exposure misclassification might also be present. We cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding despite our control for multiple potential confounders. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) and equilibrium dialysis have been proven to be effective for the measurement of total testosterone, but the chemiluminescent immunoassay was used in this article because of clinical limitation. Thus, LC\u2013MS/MS should be used in the following studies. Furthermore, the sample size in different menstrual groups will need to be increased in future studies.    5  CONCLUSION  Our study concluded that PCOS women with amenorrhea show a higher prevalence of IR, prediabetes, and dyslipidemia than PCOS women with oligomenorrhea or eumenorrhea. These data suggested that the severity of menstrual dysfunction could be used as a readily obtainable marker for the identification of PCOS women at greatest risk of cardiometabolic diseases, which may help refine the indications for screening of cardiometabolic diseases in PCOS women. Furthermore, our results emphasize the importance of regular menstruation and the need to consider the menstrual cycle as a vital sign of general health, even among adolescents.
