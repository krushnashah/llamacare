    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is essentially a group of endocrine disorders that\ncommonly affect women during their reproductive age. 1 PCOS is characterized by irregular, anovulatory, menstrual cycles, features\nof hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. 2  Although the exact etiology and pathophysiology of PCOS are not yet fully understood,\nvarious and many hypotheses, such as genetic susceptibility, and environmental and\ninflammatory process, have been proposed. 1 The association between hematological parameters and PCOs is still an area of\nactive research. Previous studies on hematological values, 3     \u2013 9 such as hemoglobin, 10 the white blood cell (WBC) count, 6 mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width (RDW), the basophil\ncount 4 , 11 , and PCOS,\nhave shown different results. Therefore, further research on blood parameters and\nPCOS needs to be conducted. Moreover, analyses of peripheral blood parameters were\npreviously performed using a manual procedure, which was time-consuming and required\npersonnel with high technical skills, and the results were doubtful. Currently,\nanalyses and interpretation of peripheral blood parameters are conducted using\nautomated analyzers. The current study was conducted to assess if there is a\ndifference in blood parameters (hemoglobin, RDW, WBCs, and MPV) between women with\nPCOS and healthy women.    Methods   Study design and setting  A case\u2013control study was conducted to compare hematological values between women\nwith PCOS and healthy women in Faisal bin Mishal Center for Infertility,\nBuraidah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). There are 7 governmental and 11 private\ncenters for assisted reproductive technology in KSA. The study received ethical\napproval from the Regional Research Ethics Committee of Qassim Province\n(#1440-1458966), Buraidah, KSA.    Selection of participants  The inclusion criteria were infertile women (age: 19\u201242 years) with PCOS (cases)\nwho were diagnosed in accordance with the Rotterdam criteria. 2 Two or more of the following criteria had to be met:\noligomenorrhea/anovulation, detection of clinical or biochemical hirsutism, and\nthe presence of morphology of polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography (\u226512\nfollicles in each ovary measuring 2\u20139\u2009mm in diameter). 2 Age-matched, healthy, non-pregnant women who presented to the center for\nmale infertility were the controls. The exclusion criteria (for cases and\ncontrols) were women with diabetes, hematological disease, hypertension, thyroid\nproblems, endometriosis, and any systemic disease. At presentation and after\nsigning an informed consent form, a detailed clinical gynecological history and\nexaminations were performed for each participant. Transvaginal ultrasonography\nwas then performed for each woman in privacy with attendance by a nurse.    Measurements  Weight and height measurements were taken, and body mass index (BMI) was computed\nusing the following equation: BMI\u2009=\u2009weight in kg/(height in\nmeters) 2 .  A volume of 2\u2009mL of blood was withdrawn from every participant in a tube with\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The blood was analyzed for a complete blood\ncount using an automated hematology analyzer and by following the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Sysmex KX-21; Sysmex Co., Ltd., Kobe, Japan) as previously\ndescribed. 12 , 13  The total sample size of 60 women in each arm of the study (cases and controls)\nwas calculated according to the expected difference in the mean of the\ninvestigated variables (WBC count, hemoglobin, platelets, red blood cells\n[RBCs], and RDW) that would provide 80% power to detect a 5% difference at\n\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. We assumed that 10% of women would not respond or have incomplete\ndata.    Statistical analysis  Data were entered in a computer and we used SPSS for Windows, version 21 (IBM\nCorp., Armonk, NY, USA) for data analysis. Data are expressed as the proportion,\nmean (standard deviation), or median (interquartile range). Continuous variables\nwere assessed for normality using the Shapiro test. The t -test\nand Mann\u2013Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous data between cases and\nthe controls when the data were normally and abnormally distributed,\nrespectively. The \u03c7 2 test was used to compare categorical variables.\nTwo-tailed tests were used and P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.     Results  The women\u2019s mean age was 29.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years. There were no significant differences in\nage, residence, and education between the cases and the controls. BMI was\nsignificantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the controls (P\u2009=\u20090.024, Table 1 ).   Table 1.

Discussion  The current study showed no significant differences in various hematological values\nbetween women with PCOS and controls. This finding is consistent with that of\nUcakturk et\u00a0al. 14 who reported no significant differences in hemoglobin, RBCs, the platelet\ncount, and WBCs between women with PCOS and women without PCOS. Similarly, Rashidi et\u00a0al. 15 reported no significant difference in serum iron levels between cases (PCOS)\nand controls. However, Han et\u00a0al. 10 reported significantly higher hemoglobin levels in women with PCOS compared\nwith controls. Hormone levels in women with PCOS affect hemoglobin levels.\nTestosterone is a hematopoietic hormone and has a dose-dependent stimulatory effect\non erythropoiesis. 16 , 17 Moreover, androgen affects bone marrow cells via androgen\nreceptor in the bone marrow. 18 The reduced frequency of menstruation in women with PCOS is thought to cause\ndifferences in hemoglobin levels between women without PCOS.  In the current study, there was no significant difference in WBCs between women with\nPCOS and controls. A previous study reported a positive predictive effect of WBCs\nand a negative predictive effect of lymphocytes on insulin resistance in women with PCOS. 19 In the total population (n\u2009=\u2009279), WBCs were significantly higher in the PCOS\ngroup compared with age-matched healthy women. 6 In a large study (1016 women with PCOS and a similar number of controls), Shi et\u00a0al. 7 reported that the total WBC count and lymphocyte count were significantly\nhigher in women with PCOS compared with age-matched controls. The findings of a\nhigher total WBC count and lymphocyte count remained significant when adjusted by BMI. 7 Notably, a previous study showed that increased inflammatory biomarkers in\nwomen with PCOS were equal in lean and obese women compared with BMI-matched women\nwho had no PCOS. 20 Moreover, higher circulating WBCs in women with PCOS are reversed by aerobic exercise. 21  Our study showed no significant differences in MPV and RDW between the two groups. In\na previous study, women with PCOS had a higher MPV, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio,\nneutrophil count, neutrophil to total leucocyte ratio, and basophil count compared\nwith controls. 11 Yilmaz et\u00a0al. 11 showed that MPV and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were significantly\nhigher in women with PCOS, despite similar high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nlevels, compared with patients without PCOS. A positive correlation of\nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and the WBC count and a negative\ncorrelation of MPV with BMI were also reported. Interestingly, Peker et\u00a0al. 22 reported that the RDW-coefficient of variation was not only a marker of\ninflammation in PCOS, but also an accessible marker for prediction of clomiphene\ncitrate resistance. Perhaps many factors, such as BMI, high sensitivity C-reactive\nprotein, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, are confounding\nfactors that affect the monocyte count to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nratio. Moreover, an increased monocyte count to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nratio is more sensitive than other known risk factors in predicting inflammation in\nwomen with PCOS. 5 Notably, a previous study showed that although there were no significant\ndifferences in the WBC count, MPV, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in\nwomen with PCOS compared with controls, a higher NLR, MPV, and basophil count were\ndetected in the lean PCOS group compared with controls. 4 Unlike our findings, a significantly higher RDW (another inflammatory marker)\nwas reported in women in the PCOS group compared with the control group. 4  This study has a limitation. Other hematological variables, such as serum ferritin,\nother inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, and other biochemical\nvariables, such as insulin resistance, were not investigated.    Conclusion  This study shows no significant difference in hematological parameters in Saudi women\nwith PCOS and healthy controls. A study with a larger sample size is required in the\nfuture to confirm this finding.",
