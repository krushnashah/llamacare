    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We aimed to elucidate the research status and explore research trends and future directions of research on obesity and PCOS. A bibliometric analysis of the published papers in the field of obesity and PCOS between 2012 and 2022 was conducted on the basis of the Web of Science Core Collection database. The collaboration networks, research trends, literature sources, citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and keywords analysis were statistically analyzed and visualized using the VOSviewer software. We retrieved 2843 records from 681 journals by 12307 authors from 2942 institutes in 99 countries. The number of published papers and citations had a roughly increasing trend annually. The United States and China contributed the majority of the records. Monash University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Karolinska Institute, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences were the biggest nodes in their cluster of the collaboration network map, and Moran LJ, Teede HJ, Joham AE, Escobar-Morreale HF, and Macut D were prolific authors. Research trends and hotspots were identified and visualized in the field of obesity and PCOS. Research hotspots in this field focused on insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome, metformin, and inflammation. Bariatric surgery, mitochondrial dysfunction, binding globulins, and comorbidities may be the frontiers of future research. We concluded the research status and trends in the field of obesity and PCOS. A better understanding of collaboration patterns, research hotspots, and frontiers may be useful for researchers.",
    "body": "1 Introduction  Obesity, defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health, is a worldwide pandemic disease, especially in women ( 1 , 2 ). Obesity increases the risk of multiple diseases, such as diabetes mellitus ( 3 ), cardiovascular disease ( 3 , 4 ), and PCOS ( 5 ). PCOS, characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, is one of the most common heterogeneous endocrine conditions and affected 5% to 10% of reproductive-age women, depending on the Rotterdam criteria ( 6 , 7 ). Approximately 50% of women with PCOS are overweight or obese ( 8 ). Although the etiology of PCOS remains unclear, IR and hyperandrogenemia (HA) play a major role in the pathogenesis of PCOS development and complications ( 9 ). However, obesity is strongly associated with IR and HA. Obesity amplifies and worsens the adverse metabolic and reproductive outcomes of PCOS and increases IR and compensatory hyperinsulinemia and generates testosterone while suppressing gonadotropin production ( 10 ). Meanwhile, Obesity sensitizes thecal cells to luteinizing hormone stimulation and amplifies HA by upregulating ovarian androgen levels ( 11 ). The symptoms of PCOS can be improved with weight loss through lifestyle modification, excise, drug therapy, and bariatric surgery ( 12 ). However, the pathophysiologic mechanism and intricate relationship between obesity and PCOS remain uncertain, numerous studies have been conducted to identify the question ( 13 \u2013 15 ).  Based on this, it is necessary for us to learn about the advances and novel trends in this field. Bibliometric analysis, an approach to quantifying and visualizing published documents, can provide an overview of the current research status and establish future research orientations in a specialized field ( 16 ). Bibliometric analysis revealed the research characteristics, status, and trends of PCOS in specific times and regions ( 17 , 18 ). Some studies also have explored the research status, hotspots, and trends of research between PCOS and infertility as well as IR by the method of bibliometrics ( 19 , 20 ). To the best of our knowledge, no bibliometric analysis has focused on the collaboration patterns and research trends, and hotspots of research on obesity and PCOS. To clarify the current research status and provide references for future research, we performed a bibliometric analysis to quantify and visualize this research field through analysis of the information in published papers.    2 Materials and methods   2.1 Literature source and retrieval  The retrieved documents were based on the Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, SCI-E) from 1 January 2012 to 27 July 2022. The detailed retrieval strategy was as follows: TS= (\u201cPolycystic Ovary Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome\u201d OR \u201cStein-Leventhal Syndrome\u201d) AND TS= (\u201cobesity\u201d). The document type was limited to articles and reviews. Only publications in English were included.    2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed published original articles or reviews about obesity and PCOS. Exclusion criteria were: 1) Early access, meeting abstract, editorial material, and other types; 2) repeated publications.    2.3 Literature analysis methods  All the records were downloaded as plain text and imported to VOSviewer to conduct bibliometric analysis. Corresponding data statistics and analysis were used by Excel 2019 (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0). VOSviewer (version 1.6.18, Leiden University) was an available software for creating and viewing bibliometric maps and was used for visualizing the collaborations between countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and references ( 21 ). Each node represents an individual, the same color represents the same cluster, the size of the circles means the number or frequency of individuals, and the lines between circles express the intensity of cooperation ( 22 ).     3 Results   3.1 Search results  Totally 2976 publications were identified from SCI-E. Duplicates, non-article and review publications, and non-English publications were excluded. Finally, 2843 was identified as the number of published records and included in the final bibliometric analysis (  Figure\u00a01  ).   Figure\u00a01   Flow chart of document selection and identification.       3.2 General trends and annual publications  Papers, published over the past 10 years, roughly conformed to the increasing trend year by year, and the cumulative number of published articles showed an overall upward trend (  Figure\u00a02  ). Most records were original articles and reviews (2843/2927, 97.1%), which can greatly reflect the development trends and changes in the field of obesity and PCOS. Through database searching, the 2843 documents were cited 66178 times, with an average of 23.3 times per paper, and an H-index of 101 (  Figure\u00a03  ). It can be seen that the direction of obesity and PCOS has attracted more and more researchers\u2019 attention.   Figure\u00a02   Annual and cumulative publications.      Figure\u00a03   Annual frequency of citations.       3.3 Countries and districts  Ninety-nine countries contributed to publications in the field of obesity and PCOS worldwide. The top 3 countries that published papers were the United States, China, and Turkey, accounting for 47.7% (1356/2843). Australia had the highest average number of citations (38.9), followed by the United Kingdom (38.4), the United States (37.2), Italy (35.6), and Turkey (15.4) (  Table\u00a01  ).

There was active cooperation between these countries, especially between the United States and China (  Figure\u00a04A  ). Viewed from the dynamics and trends, research about obesity and PCOS mainly focused on the United States, Greece, Australia, and Turkey from 2012 to 2017. The field and direction gradually received greater attention from other countries after 2017 (  Figure\u00a04B  ).   Figure\u00a04   Visualization map of countries and districts.

Collaborative network analyses have been conducted between universities or institutions. In a network and overlay visualization of institutions in the top 100, 6 clusters were formed and the biggest node represented that the institution published the most article in their cluster (  Figure\u00a05A  ). Monash University (n=88, 3.1%, Cluster 6), Shanghai Jiaotong University (n=57, 2.0%, Cluster 3), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (n=41, 1.4%, Cluster 2), Karolinska Institute (n=40, 1.4%, Cluster 4), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (n=38, 1.3%, Cluster 1), and Tehran University of Medical Sciences (n=32, 1.1%, Cluster 5) were the biggest nodes in their cluster, Cluster 1 was the biggest cluster, which contained 40 nodes that represented its related different universities or institutions, while Cluster 6 was the smallest, which included 4 nodes. The other clusters included 20 nodes (Cluster 2), 19 nodes (Cluster 3), and 12 nodes (Cluster 4). Furthermore, the results showed that 3 universities mainly contributed to this field from 2012 to 2017, which included Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, The University of Adelaide, and University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Since then, these studies have gradually gained popularity among other institutes, such as Monash University, and Shanghai Jiaotong University (  Figure\u00a05B  ).

The author visualization map of the top 150 productive authors formed 10 clusters (  Figure\u00a06  ). The biggest cluster was Qiao Jie (34/12307), who came from Peking University. Stener-Victorin E (30/12307) had the second biggest cluster and was from Karolinska Institute. The third biggest cluster was Moran LJ (27/12307) who has published the most documents and collaborated with other researchers frequently (  Figure\u00a06  and  Table\u00a02  ).

This study summarizes collaboration networks, research trends and hotspots, and future directions in obesity and PCOS based on bibliometric analysis. A total of 2843 records were retrieved and published in 681 journals by 12307 authors from 2942 institutes in 99 countries.  Based on our results, the number of published articles showed an increasing trend, especially in 2021, which indicated that this field had been a research hotspot, suggesting that novel researchers can engage in this research field. There is a correlation between academic productivity and socio-economic status for most countries ( 26 ). Ilagan-Vega et\u00a0al. revealed that the research and development expenditures were significantly related to the academic impact of PCOS in Southeast Asia ( 17 ). In terms of article production, the United States ranked first, followed by China, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Most of the top 5 countries with the most articles published were developed countries. The citation rate is an important index to measure the academic influence of a paper, which reflects the acceptance and recognition of a country\u2019s scientific research achievements by other countries or institutions ( 27 ). The United States (n=23718) and the United Kingdom (n=7621) were the top 2 countries with the highest total citation frequency, but the average citation frequency in Australia was higher than these two countries, which indicated that Australia had greater influence in this field. It has been reported that international collaboration is a powerful factor in promoting academic productivity in a given field ( 28 ). In our analysis, different countries and regions had different degrees of cooperation, the United States, which published the most, showed the strongest links with China, followed by the United Kingdom. At the same time, these countries were also among the top 5 most prolific countries. Regional imbalances were observed in different districts and countries, and it was essential to strengthen collaboration and communication among developed and developing countries worldwide.  Meanwhile, the analysis of institutions and authors was similar to the distribution of countries and districts. Among 2942 institutions, Monash University and The University of Adelaide (Australia), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China), Karolinska Institute, and Oulu University (European) made great contributions to this field and maintained a steady collaboration with other teams. In the last decade, Moran LJ, published the most articles, mainly focused on lifestyle intervention and metabolomics research in this direction ( 29 \u2013 31 ). Qiao Jie, from Peking University, was in the biggest cluster and mainly focused on the pathogenesis and theoretical research in this area, such as immunity ( 32 ), gut microbiota ( 33 ), and single-cell sequencing ( 34 ).  Obesity and PCOS often interacted with each other and caused a significant risk to women\u2019s health ( 5 ). Therefore, it received the attention and recognition of many journal editors. According to our results, hundreds of journals have published articles on this topic. Of 681 journals, the top 10 journals contributed the most. The most published journal was Gynecological Endocrinology, and the most cited journal was The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, while Endocrine Reviews with the highest average paper citation. In addition, the top 3 most average cited journals in the included records were published in top-ranked journals, which indicated that these journals were widely recognized and deserved the attention of researchers in the field. These top-cited records, published in Endocrine Reviews, PloS One, Human Reproduction Update, and European Journal of Endocrinology, together had been cited more than 1853 times in the past 10 years. The common themes in this field\u2019s top 10 cited research articles were the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PCOS and its relationship to obesity. Co-citation analysis of references can tell researchers which references had made important contributions in this field. In co-citation analysis, \u201cinsulin resistance\u201d, \u201cmechanisms\u201d, \u201cimplications\u201d, and \u201ccriteria\u201d were the keywords of the top co-citation references, which deserved reference for new researchers ( 23 , 35 , 36 ).  High-frequency keywords are usually used to identify research hotspots in a research field. Shi et\u00a0al. revealed that the research trends of PCOS were gradually shifting from treatment to mechanistic exploration ( 18 ). According to the results of the keywords network map, we found that the research about obesity and PCOS mainly focused on insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, drug therapy, and inflammation in recent years, which involved the mechanism, comorbidities, and treatment ( 37 \u2013 39 ). It indicated that, in addition to mechanistic exploration, treatment was still a hot research topic in the field of obesity and PCOS.  The co-occurrence keyword analysis of the past 2 years revealed mechanisms, comorbidities, drug therapy, and bariatric surgery as emerging topics. Among obese girls with PCOS, mitochondrial acylcarnitine (C4) was associated with valine and free fatty acids ( 40 ). According to Fatemeh et\u00a0al. ( 41 ), PCOS may reduce the occurrence of silent coronary artery disease in a population-based cohort study. Compared with metformin, bariatric surgery should be prioritized for patients with obesity and PCOS in a Chinese prospective nonrandomized trial ( 42 ). In these studies, researchers were able to identify the research hotspots, which may shape future research directions.    5 Limitations  Without a doubt, the study had several limitations. Firstly, we only analyzed records from the Web of Science Core Collection and only included English articles and reviews, which might lead to selection bias. However, the number of retrieved papers was large enough to reflect the real research situation ( 43 ). Secondly, due to the diversity of keywords and the authors with the same name, it was hard to accurately retrieve all the records.    6 Conclusions  Utilizing the retrieved records about obesity and PCOS, we performed a bibliometric and visual analysis. The number of papers published had roughly risen and extensive cooperation was observed between different countries and institutions. In this field, comorbidities, mitochondrial dysfunction, binding globulin, and bariatric surgery were the frontiers of research. Bibliometric analysis of the literature in this field was helpful for researchers to understand the collaboration patterns, research hotspots, and frontiers.
