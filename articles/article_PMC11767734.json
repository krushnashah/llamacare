    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Globally, it affects around 6% and 20% of women of reproductive age [ 1 , 2 ]. As per Rotterdam criteria, it is characterized by any two symptoms from hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction (OD, oligo-ovulation/anovulation), and polycystic ovaries (PCO) [ 3 ]. Further, PCOS can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the above symptoms. These are phenotype A (OD + hyperandrogenism + PCO), phenotype B (hyperandrogenism + OD), phenotype C (PCO + hyperandrogenism), and phenotype D (OD + PCO) [ 4 ]. It is a multifaceted disease with several metabolic disturbances like (insulin resistance), obesity, dyslipidemia, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( Figure 1 ) [ 5 ]. One of the main pathophysiological characteristics of PCOS is defined as insulin resistance (IR), which exacerbates the clinical appearance of PCOS and contributes to hyperandrogenism (increase in free androgen levels) [ 6 ]. Hyperandrogenism can lead to an increase in PCOS symptoms like acne, hirsutism, and ovulatory dysfunction [ 7 ].  Although the exact causes of PCOS are still unknown, it is believed that both endogenous and exogenous factors play a significant role. Various factors like genetics, epigenetics, dietary preference, lifestyle, and environmental factors play an essential role in the etiology of PCOS ( Figure 1 ) [ 8 , 9 ]. Hormonal dysregulation is also one of the hallmark features of PCOS, which manifests in elevated levels of androgens (hyperandrogenism) and the disrupted secretion of gonadotropins like luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [ 10 ]. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia exacerbates hyperandrogenism by stimulating ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens. This suppresses sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which increases free androgen levels in the [ 11 , 12 ]. Additionally, several immunological factors are recognized as playing roles in the development of PCOS [ 13 ]. Immunological factors involved in PCOS pathogenesis include chronic low-grade inflammation, characterized by a rise in IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CRP levels [ 14 , 15 ]  Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation together play critical roles in the development and progression of PCOS [ 16 ]. Oxidative stress exacerbates insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, while inflammation disrupts ovarian function and increases cardiovascular risk [ 17 ]. Because of its multifactorial nature, the management of PCOS is complex, and it requires a comprehensive and individualized approach. According to the most recent international evidence-based guidelines, lifestyle interventions are the primary early strategy for assessing and managing PCOS [ 18 ]. Lifestyle changes, dietary patterns, physical activity, and stress management are crucial for controlling the symptoms of PCOS [ 19 ].  Diet and exercise are two crucial areas that must be addressed for lifestyle change adjustments to be successful. Dietary habits, including caloric intake, macronutrient composition, and the quality of food choices, play a critical role in weight management, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory markers in women with PCOS [ 20 ]. A diet low in refined carbohydrates and high in fiber can help to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Previous studies have reported the impact of various dietary patterns, including the consumption of low levels of saturated fat, a low glycemic index (GI) score, and the consumption of a high-fiber and ketogenic Mediterranean diet on PCOS management [ 21 , 22 ]. A diet low in refined carbohydrates and high in fiber helps to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity [ 23 ]. Additionally, findings also revealed that dietary supplements such as inositol, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids; mineral supplements (zinc, magnesium selenium, and chromium); and antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) help in reducing insulin resistance, improving ovulatory function, and decreasing inflammation in PCOS patients [ 24 , 25 , 26 ]. Oxidative stress is linked to several clinical conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular illnesses. An increase in oxidative stress affects the pathophysiology of PCOS patients, which results in insulin resistance, increased androgen, and chronic inflammation [ 27 ]. A diet rich in antioxidants or a high-antioxidant-capacity diet (\u03b1-tocopherol, vitamin C, vitamin D, polyphenols, and \u03b2-carotene) decrease the odds of PCOS [ 28 , 29 ]. Obesity exacerbates PCOS symptoms; therefore, weight loss is also considered one of the strategies of PCOS management. Moreover, dietary modifications can help weight loss in overweight or obese women, lowering IR, testosterone levels, and other risk factors [ 30 ].  Physical activity is another cornerstone of PCOS management. Any movement the skeletal muscles produce that requires energy use is considered physical activity [ 31 ]. Physical activity and regular exercise (a combination of aerobic and resistance training) help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce body fat, and enhance cardiovascular health in women with PCOS [ 32 ]. Exercise also improves psychological wellbeing in women with PCOS. Along with this, various other methods like yoga (breathing, asana, mudras, and meditation), acupuncture, and naturopathy also help in managing regular hormone levels and menstrual cycles and reduce stress and anxiety in women with PCOS [ 33 , 34 ].  Conventional approaches to PCOS treatment have focused on pharmacological interventions like insulin sensitizers, anti-androgens, oral contraceptives, and ovulation induction [ 35 , 36 ]. These methods have not always addressed the underlying lifestyle factors that contribute to the development and persistence of PCOS. Further, this has led to the development of an interest in non-pharmacological approaches, particularly lifestyle modifications, for the management of PCOS. The present review aims to assess the studies in the last ten years and provide a systematic overview of the current evidence regarding the role of lifestyle modifications in managing PCOS.    2. Study Selection and Screening  We performed extensive literature searches in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Sciences databases. The search strategy included the following keywords along with their medical subject headings (MeSH terms): \u201cPCOS\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic ovarian syndrome\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic ovary disease\u201d OR \u201cPolycystic ovary disorder\u201d OR \u201cPCOD\u201d; \u201cdiet\u201d OR \u201clow glycemic index diet\u201d OR \u201canti-inflammatory diet\u201d OR \u201chigh fiber diet\u201d OR \u201clean protein\u201dOR\u201domega-3 fatty acids\u201d OR \u201cantioxidant-rich diet\u201d OR \u201cketogenic diet\u201d OR \u201cketo diet\u201d OR \u201ccalorie restricted diet\u201d OR \u201chigh protein diet\u201d OR \u201ctime restricted diet\u201d OR \u201cmicrobiome rich diet\u201d; \u201cphysical activity\u201d OR \u201caerobic exercise\u201d OR \u201cregular exercise\u201d OR \u201cresistance training\u201d OR \u201cyoga\u201d OR \u201cmeditation\u201d OR \u201clifestyle\u201d OR \u201cquality of life\u201d; \u201cbehavior modification\u201d OR \u201cmindfulness training program\u201d OR \u201ceducation module\u201d; \u201cclinical trial\u201d OR \u201crandomized controlled trial\u201d. Only articles written in the English language and published in the last 10 years were included ( Figure 2 ). Studies conducted in animal models and in vitro models were excluded. Only randomized controlled trials were included and all other study designs, such as observational studies, single-arm studies, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, etc., were excluded. Two authors screened titles and abstracts to verify their inclusion using Rayyan software ( https://new.rayyan.ai/ ). Additional references from included studies were also searched wherever necessary.  We have received a total of 1157 studies, out of which 555 studies were found to be duplicates. After removing duplicates, 821 studies were primarily screened by title and abstract. After primary screening, 209 articles were selected, but only 103 articles in the full text were retrieved. After full-text screening, 80 papers were finally included in the study. Further papers were divided into three categories: \u2018diet and supplements\u2019, \u2018physical activity\u2019, and \u2018behavioral and education model therapy\u2019. This review was further developed by addressing each subcategory separately.    3. Dietary Habits and Supplements in PCOS Management  Several types of diets were assessed for PCOS management ( Figure 3 ). The results of such RCT studies are summarized in Table 1 . Each type of diet and its mechanisms are summarized below.   3.1. Low-Glycemic-Index (GI) Diet  A low-GI diet includes foods that cause a slow, gradual rise in blood sugar levels, helping to improve insulin sensitivity [ 86 ]. Further, stable insulin levels help to reduce excess androgen (testosterone) production and help to control symptoms like acne, hirsutism, and irregular menstrual cycles [ 87 ]. Studies have shown that incorporating a low-GI diet can play a significant role in controlling the metabolic and hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS in women. Additionally, low-GI foods, like whole grains (oats, quinoa, barley), legumes (beans, lentils), fruits (berries, apples, pears), and vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower), are rich in anti-inflammatory compounds. Findings show that dietary intervention (via a low-calorie, low-glycemic diet) increases uric acid and GPx3 (glutathione peroxidase) activity, further reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in women with PCOS [ 88 ]. In an RCT study on 37 women with PCOS, low-glycemic-index diets were given to 19 women, and 18 women received diets with normal glycemic index scores. The results showed an increase in ovulatory cycles and improvement in insulin resistance with decreased serum androgen levels [ 89 ]. In recent meta-analysis findings, low-GI diets reduce HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, and total testosterone levels compared to HGI diets in women with PCOS [ 90 ].    3.2. Ketogenic Diet  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein and low-carbohydrate diet that forces the body into a metabolic state called ketosis [ 91 ]. In this condition, the body becomes highly adept at using fat rather than carbohydrates as fuel [ 92 ]. A ketogenic diet contains fats (55\u201360%), proteins (35%), and carbohydrates (5\u201310%) in total daily calories [ 93 ]. The therapeutic role of the KD diet has been observed in diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, depression, renal function, Alzheimer\u2019s cardiovascular disease, etc. [ 94 , 95 ]. In an umbrella review including 17 meta-analyses of 68 RCT results, VLCKD (very-low-calorie ketogenic diet) was significantly associated with improving anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes [ 96 ]. Women with PCOS are frequently obese or overweight, which exacerbates IR and hormone abnormalities. The ketogenic diet may result in more successful weight loss because the body burns fat instead of glucose when in the metabolic state of ketosis. Studies have reported that a ketogenic diet helps to lower androgen levels and improve reproductive hormone levels, insulin sensitivity, and SHBG levels in PCOS women [ 21 ]. Similar results have been observed in a systematic review and analysis performed on 11 RCTs: the findings showed that the ketogenic diet significantly decreases [ 96 ] weight loss, BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass in obese or overweight women with PCOS [ 97 ]. However, it cannot be recommended in the long term as it has low carbohydrate and high fat content which can negatively affects the body as it has less nutritional value. Most of the studies have also intervened in KD for a shorter period only, with gradually increasing the calories during the intervention.    3.3. Anti-Inflammatory Rich Diet  Systemic inflammation plays a role in the etiology of PCOS [ 98 ]. In obese people, adipocytes release many pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate macrophages, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation. Further, increased cytokine levels result in disorder progressions like cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance [ 99 , 100 ]. Anti-inflammatory diets, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids, can help to mitigate inflammation. In RCT, the beneficial effects of green cardamom on the inflammatory markers in women with PCOS were observed. Findings from the study showed that inflammatory markers like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and CRP serum levels significantly declined in the intervention group compared to the placebo group [ 43 ]. Moreover, similar results were observed in a pilot study by Mizger et al., which showed that an anti-inflammatory diet improves total antioxidant capacity, IL-1 and IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and androstenedione levels in girls with PCOS [ 101 ]. In addition to the above foods, onion ( Allium cepa L.) has good anti-inflammatory properties, and results from clinical trials studies revealed that obese/overweight women with PCOS who consume a high dose of raw red onion showed a decrease in serum adiponectin, leptin, and hs-CRP level with non-significant changes in IR and anthropometric parameters [ 102 , 103 ].    3.4. Antioxidant-Rich Diet  Oxidative stress is an imbalance between antioxidants and oxidants in living biological systems [ 104 ]. Oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of PCOS, leading to insulin resistance, androgen excesses, and chronic inflammation [ 105 , 106 ]. Women with PCOS have an imbalance in their total serum antioxidant content, which exacerbates cellular damage and alters the defense mechanism [ 107 ]. Studies have shown that pregnant women with PCOS have high serum MDA (malondialdehyde) levels (an oxidative stress marker) and low antioxidant vitamin levels compared to healthy pregnant women [ 108 , 109 ]. Vitamin D plays a significant role as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the body, and it helps to mitigate the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 110 ]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 70 vitamin-deficient women with PCOS, when administrated to vitamin D supplementation for 4 weeks, the results showed beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis parameters, hs-CRP, and MDA levels [ 111 ]. Further findings from various clinical trials have shown that vitamin D supplementation to women with PCOS help to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, HOMA-B (homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function), adiponectin, and other biochemical parameters [ 112 , 113 , 114 ]. In another RCT, women with PCOS, co-administered with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid for 12 weeks, saw beneficial effects on serum total testosterone, hs-CRP, and plasma TAC and MDA levels [ 115 ]. In addition to the above-mentioned antioxidant food, clinical trials have shown that the administration of various antioxidant supplements like selenium, green cardamom, astaxanthin, berberine phytosome, and isoflavones helps to improve anthropometric parameters, biochemical, hormonal and metabolic symptoms in women with PCOS [ 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 ].    3.5. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Rich Diet  Omega-3 fatty acids have powerful anti-inflammatory properties that can improve insulin sensitivity and decrease androgen levels in metabolic syndromes like PCOS [ 121 ]. An increasing intake of omega-3 and other PUFAs can help to reduce and alleviate low-grade chronic inflammation and other symptoms in women with PCOS via TGF-\u03b2 signaling [ 122 ]. The sources of omega-3 fatty acids are fish, like salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout, and nuts, and seed oils, like flaxseed oil, chia seed oil, and walnut oil. The results from a double-blind RCT conducted on 64 overweight or obese women with PCOS showed improvement in serum adiponectin levels, IR, and the lipid profile in the intervention group as compared to the control group [ 123 ]. Studies also showed that omega-3 and vitamin E intake effectively improved the mental health parameters and gene expression of PPAR-\u03b3, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in women with PCOS [ 124 ]. Further, omega-3 fatty acid supplements in women with PCOS helped to improve biochemical parameters LH, LH/FSH, lipid profiles, WC, adiponectin levels, and regularized the menstrual cycle [ 125 , 126 ].    3.6. High-Fiber, High-Protein Diet and Other Dietary Supplements  Foods rich in fiber content and a high-protein diet, preferably from lean protein sources, helped to slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, preventing spikes in blood glucose and insulin levels [ 127 ]. Improved insulin sensitivity can help to reduce androgen levels and improve androgen levels, hormones, and menstrual irregularities. High-fiber foods include vegetables (broccoli, spinach, carrots, and kale), fruits (apples, berries, pears, and oranges), whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, whole oats, and barley), legumes (lentils, chickpeas, and black beans), and nuts and seeds (almonds, flaxseeds, and chia seeds). Studies have shown that fiber intake in women with PCOS was negatively correlated with IR, fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and androgen levels [ 128 ]. Additional findings from an RCT study on 48 women with PCOS showed a reduction in serum insulin, TAG and LDL, and cholesterol and a significant increase in TAC and GSH levels in those groups in which women consumed a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. Many dietary supplements like carnitine reduce carotid intima-media thickness and inflammatory factors in women with PCOS [ 129 ]. The administration of melatonin in women with PCOS also showed a reduction in hirsutism, testosterone, hs-CRP, and MDA levels with an elevation in TAC and GSH levels [ 130 ].  In addition to the above-mentioned dietary supplements DASH (The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is also found be effective for women with PCOS, improving reproductive health [ 131 ]. A DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets; in addition to this, the intake of sodium should be less than 2400 mg/day [ 132 ]. The DASH eating plan is a low-glycemic-index low-energy-dense diet that was first suggested to lower blood pressure [ 133 ]; however, the beneficial effects of DAH diet alone and with whole-food, plant-based diets have also been reported regarding insulin resistance, inflammation diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [ 134 , 135 , 136 ].    3.7. Microbiome Rich Diet  Research has shown the existence of a close association between the gut microbiota of PCOS patients and the development of insulin resistance, which is a corresponding factor for PCOS, manifesting through short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, sex hormones, and the brain\u2013gut axis [ 78 ]. Compared with healthy people, the diversity in the gut microbiota of PCOS patients shows a reduction with changes in composition, damaging the intestinal mucosal barrier [ 137 ]. Healthy gut microbiota can be restored by switching to a healthy diet. A microbiome-rich diet is rich in fermented foods, whole grains, fruits/seeds, and fiber. It can also be supplied via probiotic or symbiotic supplements. In an RCT where women with PCOS were treated with multispecies probiotic supplementation for 8 weeks, the results showed non-significant improvement in pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and the CRP level in women with PCOS [ 138 ]. In another double-blind RCT on sixty women with PCOS, the administration of synbiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains) for 12 weeks resulted in beneficial effects on IR, triglycerides, and VLDL cholesterol levels [ 116 ]. A meta-analysis of 7 RCTs revealed that probiotic/symbiotic supplementation decreased insulin and triglyceride levels and increased HDL levels compared to the control in women with PCOS. Although insignificant, they also improved other biochemical and anthropometric parameters [ 139 ]. Another meta-analysis of 8 RCTs showed that probiotic/symbiotic treatment can effectively improve hormonal, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory outcomes of PCOS [ 140 ]. Therefore, they can also serve as a good option for PCOS management.     4. Physical Activity (Aerobic Exercise and Resistance Training) and PCOS  Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups, is maintained continuously, and is rhythmic in nature [ 141 ]. Studies have proven that exercise, particularly aerobic workouts, offers multiple benefits for managing PCOS symptoms, such as improving insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health, and hormonal balance ( Figure 4 ) [ 142 , 143 ]. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, running, cycling, or swimming, helps to enhance insulin sensitivity by improving how muscles absorb glucose from the blood. It may regulate menstrual periods by lowering insulin levels and enhancing ovarian function [ 144 , 145 ]. In a study on women with PCOS, a significant decrease in BMI and fat mass was observed, along with an increase in FSH, free testosterone, and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, in the experimental group (exercised for 12 weeks, 3 sessions of 20 min) as compared to the control [ 146 ]. International guidelines for the management of PCOS also recommended that adults (18\u201364 years) should aim for a minimum of 250 min/per week of moderate-intensity activities or 150 min/per week of vigorous-intensity activities or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle-strengthening activities (e.g., resistance/flexibility), ideally on two non-consecutive days per week [ 18 ]. Various types of aerobic exercises which can be used to improve PCOS symptoms are listed below:  (i) HIIT (high-intensity interval training) includes short bursts of intense activity followed by rest or low-intensity periods. (ii) MICT (moderate-intensity interval) training includes moderate-intensity exercise, such as jogging, swimming, or cycling. (iii) IAT (intermittent aerobic training) is similar to HIIT but has lower intensity and longer active intervals. (iv) CAT (continuous aerobic training) includes steady-state aerobic exercise with consistent pace and intensity and long-distance running or cycling. The results of clinical trials that assess the impact of physical activity in managing PCOS are summarized in Table 2 .  Resistance training is a kind of strength or weight training encompassing workouts that enhance muscle strength and endurance by working against some form of resistance. Findings from various studies have shown that resistance training alone and along with aerobic exercise helped in reducing the symptoms of PCOS. Combined (RT resistance training + MICT) is a type of physical exercise that incorporates both aerobic (moderate-intensity) and resistance (strength) training and also helps to improve metabolic function, overall fitness, and weight management in women with PCOS. A systematic review including 7 RCTs showed that physical exercise helped to improve reproductive functions, hormonal balance, and menstrual cycle regularity [ 160 ]. Likewise, meta-analysis related to physical exercise interventions on women with PCOS (data from 19 studies) has shown that physical exercise helps to reduce BMI and waist circumference. Results also suggested that a minimum of 120 min per week of vigorous-intensity exercise is required to produce beneficial health effects for women with PCOS [ 161 ].    5. Behavioral and Education Module  A lot of mental issues, like depression, anxiety, body image concerns, low self-esteem, eating disorders, stress, emotional strain, mood swings, sleep disorders, etc., are also associated with PCOS [ 162 ]. These issues often degrade patients\u2019 quality of life and must be addressed via conventional treatment [ 163 , 164 ]. Developing a behavioral or education model can be an effective way to help women with PCOS to improve the effectiveness of conventional treatment and provide a holistic approach to PCOS management [ 165 , 166 ]. These modules may include education about understanding PCOS and treatment options available, behavioral interventions (diet, exercise, sleep), stress management (relaxation techniques, cognitive therapy), dealing with body changes, goal setting, tracking progress, positive reinforcement, etc. [ 167 , 168 ]. They can be designed as counselling/therapy sessions, group discussions, workshops, education materials, or mobile apps [ 169 , 170 ]. Table 3 summarizes the results of RCTs that have studied the effectiveness of these modules in PCOS patients.  In an RCT involving 161 patients, a one-time structured education module significantly ( p < 0.05) improved the understanding of PCOS and quality of life (emotions, fertility, weight and mental wellbeing), but could not improve anthropometric and biochemical parameters [ 182 ]. Another study focused on 181 women with PCOS who wanted to conceive and received 20 group sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with or without a short message service (SMS) as compared to standard care. Groups receiving CBT showed better weight loss results than those receiving standard care, and the inclusion of SMS further enhanced the benefits [ 183 ]. Additionally, an RCT study with 28 women with PCOS was administered with 2 months of mindfulness stress management training, which resulted in a significant decrease in anxiety, depression, and stress and an increase in quality of life as compared to the control [ 184 ]. In a recent meta-analysis (8 RCTs), it was shown that supplementing behavioral interventions to routine treatment of PCOS plan enhances the reduction in weight, BMI, and waist circumference and improvement in depression conditions [ 185 ]. In a meta-analysis of 8 studies, it was observed that cognitive behavioral therapy helps to reducing anxiety and improve the quality of life, compliance, and pregnancy rate in PCOS patients [ 186 ].  Further, several clinical trials have been conducted using multiple lifestyle interventions like dietary measures, behavioral measures, and physical exercise for the treatment of PCOS. In a randomized three-arm parallel study, women with PCOS received structured support, including dietary counseling, a tailored exercise regimen, and behavior change strategies to improve physical activity levels. Results showed that BMI, waist circumference, and total cholesterol levels were significantly decreased in the intervention group. Findings from the study showed that dietary changes were associated with better metabolic outcomes, suggesting that targeted nutritional adjustments are essential for effective PCOS management, particularly for weight control and reducing metabolic risks [ 187 ]. In an RCT, women with PCOS received a structured lifestyle program focused on diet and exercise. This was tailored to improving physical activity levels and addressing common exercise barriers. The intervention significantly reduced perceived barriers to exercise. It enhanced perceived benefits, suggesting that lifestyle modification can make exercise more accessible and appealing for women with PCOS, potentially supporting better long-term health outcomes [ 151 ].    6. Future Perspective  As research on PCOS treatment goes on, lifestyle modifications like dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral changes are recognized as essential components of its management or treatment. Integrating multiple lifestyle modifications provides the most comprehensive benefits in managing PCOS. Evidence shows that these changes help to improve PCOS symptoms like insulin sensitivity, weight management, menstrual cycle regularity, and metabolic parameters. Further, due to heterogeneity in PCOS in terms of phenotypes, clinical presentations, underlined pathophysiology, and response to treatment, personalized interventions are needed. This can be achieved using artificial intelligence to plan individualized dietary/exercise interventions [ 188 ]. Further, women with PCOS often experience depression, anxiety, and a diminished quality of life, which can undermine adherence to lifestyle changes. Future research should explore integrative approaches that combine lifestyle interventions with mental health support, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or mindfulness/meditation practices, which can reduce depression and improve quality of life.    7. Conclusions  In conclusion, lifestyle modifications, encompassing dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral interventions, are pivotal in managing PCOS by addressing both metabolic and reproductive complications. Evidence from various RCTs suggests that dietary, interventions such as low-glycemic-index foods; caloric restrictions; high-fiber, ketogenic, and Mediterranean diets; omega three- and antioxidant-rich food; and anti-inflammatory diets help to improve insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance and reduce PCOS symptoms. Out of these, the DASH diet and low-glycemic-index (GI) diet are highly effective for PCOS management as they improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgen levels, and regulate menstrual cycles. Likewise, regular physical activities (aerobic and resistance exercises) also enhance metabolic function and help to reduce weight, achieve glucose homeostasis, balance hormone levels, and improve overall quality of life. Among all the forms of exercise, the aerobic exercise (AE) was found to be more effective in PCOS. Furthermore, continuous aerobic training (CAT) and intermittent aerobic training (IAT) were found to be equally effective in reducing anthropometric indices and hyperandrogenism and in the improvement of quality of life (QOL) in women with PCOS. Further, the future of PCOS management lies in integrating personalized dietary and physical exercise interventions using technology-driven approaches.",
