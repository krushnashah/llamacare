    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common chronic endocrinopathies affecting women of reproductive age worldwide (Mukherjee et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Sadeghi et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Zhu & Goodarzi, 2022 ). Besides hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries and/or ovulatory dysfunction, a plethora of comorbidities may accompany such syndrome, including hirsutism, acne, cardiovascular problems, high incidence rate of breast and endometrial cancer, high risk for infertility and pregnancy complications, as well as various metabolic alterations such as obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Barthelmess & Naz, 2014 ; Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Gu et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Parker et\u00a0al., 2022b ; Rajska et\u00a0al., 2020 ). However, despite the long\u2010term and disabling repercussions on both health and life quality of PCOS\u2010affected women, the mechanisms regulating the occurrence of this syndrome are still far from being fully understood (Thackray, 2019 ; Yurtdas & Akdevelioglu, 2020 ). In this context, while environmental, epigenetic and hereditary influences are widely investigated (De Leo et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Escobar\u2010Morreale, 2018 ; Patel, 2018 ; Siddiqui et\u00a0al., 2022 ), emerging evidence highlighted the critical role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of this syndrome (Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Parker et\u00a0al., 2022a ; Yurtdas & Akdevelioglu, 2020 ). Indeed, several studies revelled a clear and strong association between the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, that is, the microbial ecosystem inhabiting the human intestine, and multiple alterations in clinical\u2010metabolic parameters in women affected by PCOS, leading to the formulation of the PCOS microbiological theory, also known as \u2018dysbiosis of gut microbiota\u2019 (DOGMA theory) (Gu et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Insenser et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Torres et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Tremellen & Pearce, 2012 ). According to the latter, the disruption of the gut microbiota eubiosis favours an increased gut mucosal permeability with a parallel increment of lipopolysaccharide release, produced by intestinal Gram\u2010negative bacteria into the systemic circulation, leading to the activation of the host immune system that responds soliciting an inflammatory status responsible for the onset of various comorbidities (Insenser et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Qi et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Sanchez\u2010Garrido & Tena\u2010Sempere, 2020 ; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2020 ). More recently, a clinical study also demonstrated that regardless of PCOS phenotype, if hyperandrogenic or not (Myers et\u00a0al., 2023 ), gut microbiota results to be altered when compared to healthy individuals (Suturina et\u00a0al., 2022 ).  In addition, recent studies demonstrated that also vaginal microbiota undergoes important alterations in PCOS\u2010affected women with a significant reduction of the genus Lactobacillus , generally associated with a healthy status, and a parallel increment of potential pathogens such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the genera Prevotella and Mycoplasma (Gu et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Lu et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Mukherjee et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Tu et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021 ). However, despite growing scientific evidence suggesting the association between PCOS and altered vaginal and intestinal microbial ecosystems, there are still few studies concerning the characterization of the intestinal and vaginal microbiota in such patients.  Among the natural molecules with positive impact on the management of PCOS, the scientific community has recently become interested in \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin (\u03b1\u2010LA) (Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Tinghall Nilsson et\u00a0al., 2024 ; Zapata et\u00a0al., 2017 ) not only for its physical characteristics of water solubility and heat stability, which make it an easy\u2010to\u2010use ingredient for the formulation of food supplements, but also for its low immunogenicity, high nutritional value and ability to stimulate health\u2010promoting effects. Indeed, \u03b1\u2010LA is a human milk\u2010derived protein that reaches unchanged the intestine where it can be subjected to proteolytic digestion by pancreatic enzymes, including pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin, releasing not only bioactive peptides with antibacterial, anti\u2010inflammatory, analgesic and immunomodulatory effects, but also its peculiar aminoacidic building\u2010block, encompassing tryptophan, lysine, cysteine and branched\u2010chain amino acids (Kamau et\u00a0al., 2010 ; Krissansen, 2007 ; Layman et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Pellegrini et\u00a0al., 1999 ; Yamaguchi et\u00a0al., 2009 ). Furthermore, thanks to its positive effect on the permeability of intestinal tight junctions, \u03b1\u2010LA improves the intestinal absorption of some micronutrients, including inositols, which are natural molecules generally used in combination with \u03b1\u2010LA to treat PCOS, consequently improving clinical outcomes in PCOS\u2010affected patients (Bizzarri et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Kamenov et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Monastra et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Montanino Oliva et\u00a0al., 2018 ). In addition, some recent works suggested the positive role of \u03b1\u2010LA in attenuating the microbial dysbiosis associated with PCOS, inducing an increment in the relative abundance of certain beneficial microorganisms such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains (Boscaini et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022 ). However, despite this evidence, the possible impact of the administration of \u03b1\u2010LA on the intestinal and vaginal bacterial communities of women with PCOS, is still far from being fully dissected.  In this context, a pooled\u2010analysis was first set up to provide an accurate overview of the microbial alterations characterizing the intestinal and vaginal microbiota of women with PCOS. Subsequently, as PCOS condition exhibited a reduced relative abundance of two health\u2010promoting microbial genera, that is, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus , in the intestinal and vaginal microbial ecosystem, respectively, we investigated, through in\u00a0vitro experiments, the ability of \u03b1\u2010LA to positively influence the growth performances of members of these two bacterial taxa and to modulate the taxonomic composition and growth performances of the microbial players of the female intestinal and vaginal microbiota. Finally, with the aim to deeply investigate and corroborate beneficial effects of \u03b1\u2010LA, an in\u00a0vivo pilot study based on \u03b1\u2010LA oral administration to women with clinical signs of PCOS evaluated the ability of this protein to modulate the dysbiotic vaginal microbiota typical of a PCOS condition, thus opening towards new perspective applications of such molecule.    EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES   Selection of public data sets  To perform a pooled\u2010analysis aimed at defining possible differences in the taxonomic composition of both faecal and vaginal microbiota between healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women, an in\u2010depth literature search was carried out to retrieve all microbiome data sets based on Illumina sequencing technology corresponding to faecal and vaginal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women. In case of studies involving the administration of drugs, prebiotics and/or probiotics or hormone treatment, only faecal and vaginal samples belonging to the control group were selected. Furthermore, faecal and vaginal samples belonging to women with pathologies other than PCOS were excluded from the analysis to avoid biases related to these additional pathologies. Based on these parameters, a total of 391 faecal samples, divided into 216 and 175 stool from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women, respectively, were selected, together with a total of 274 vaginal swabs, subdivided into 140 and 134 vaginal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women, respectively (Tables 1 and S1 ).

Paired\u2010end reads were merged, and quality control retained sequences with a length between 140 and 400\u2009bp and mean sequence quality score of >20, while sequences with homopolymers of >7\u2009bp and mismatched primers were omitted. 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were defined at 100% sequence homology using DADA2 (Callahan et\u00a0al., 2016 ). ASVs that were represented only by a single sequence were removed and all reads were classified to the lowest possible taxonomic rank using QIIME2 (Bokulich et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Caporaso et\u00a0al., 2010 ) and a reference database from the SILVA database v.132 (Quast et\u00a0al., 2013 ). Furthermore, \u03b1\u2010diversity analyses were assessed through the observed ASVs index, while biodiversity analyses were calculated through the Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index and represented through a three\u2010dimensional principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).     Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strain growth conditions   Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains were grown overnight in the De Man\u2010Rogosa\u2010Sharpe (MRS) broth (Sharlau Chemie, Spain) supplemented with 0.05% (wt/vol) L\u2010cysteine hydrochloride at 37\u00b0C in an anaerobic chamber (Concept 400; Ruskinn) (2.99% H 2 , 17.01% CO 2 and 80% N 2 ). In detail, 12 Lactobacillus and 18 Bifidobacterium strains were selected to include only strains isolated from human vaginal and faecal microbiota, respectively, from our microbial repository as well as from international microbial culture collections, encompassing one outlier per considered bacterial genus, that is, Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 20533 and Bifidobacterium asteroides LMG 10735, isolated from sour milk and honeybee gut, respectively (Table 2 ).

The same strains were also inoculated in MRS broth without the addition of \u03b1\u2010LA or any other additional proteins as a control sample. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions. After 48\u2009h of incubation, cell growth was evaluated monitoring the OD 600nm by using a plate reader (Biotek, USA), as previously described (Alessandri et\u00a0al., 2022b ; Lugli et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Tarracchini et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Briefly, plates were read in discontinuous mode with absorbance readings performed at 3\u2009min intervals three times after 48\u2009h of growth, and each reading was ahead of 30\u2009s of shaking at medium speed. Cultures were grown in triplicates, and the resulting growth data sets were expressed as the average of these replicates. MRS was filter\u2010sterilized by using a filter with pore size of 0.2\u2009\u03bcm when supplemented with \u03b1\u2010LA.    Faecal and vaginal sample collection  To test the impact of an in\u00a0vitro treatment with \u03b1\u2010LA on complex bacterial communities, both faecal and vaginal samples were collected from 10 healthy women who had not taken prebiotics, probiotics or drugs during the 3\u2009months prior to sample collection. Approximately 3\u2009g of fresh stool were collected from each woman immediately after defecation using a dedicated sterile tube provided of a sampling spoon and containing 15\u2009mL of sterile PBS (phosphate\u2010buffered solution, pH\u20096.5). In parallel, vaginal samples were collected by using a vaginal swab, then preserved in a dedicated sterile tube with 3\u2009mL PBS. In all cases, PBS was pre\u2010reduced with 0.1% (w/v) L\u2010cysteine hydrochloride. After collection, samples were immediately shipped to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions and processed within 3\u2009h of collection.    Gut and vaginal microbiota culturing  Faecal samples were inoculated in a human gut environment\u2010simulating growth medium, based on a previously described composition (Fehlbaum et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Macfarlane et\u00a0al., 1998 ) to obtain a final inoculum concentration of 2% (v/v). The pH of the growth medium was standardized to 6.8 to mimic the human colon pH prior to autoclave (Alessandri et\u00a0al., 2022a ; Macfarlane et\u00a0al., 1998 ), while vitamin and mineral solutions were sterilized by filtration using a 0.2\u2010\u03bcm filter and added to culture medium once cooled. Cultivations were carried out in 1\u2009mL of growth medium following the MiPro model (Li et\u00a0al., 2019a ), that is, involving a 96\u2010deep well plate covered with a silicone gel mat provided with a vent hole on each well, created through a sterile syringe needle. During cultivation, plates were shaken at 500\u2009rpm.  The same protocol was used for the cultivation of vaginal samples. However, in this case, a culture medium mimicking the human vaginal environment, that is, the simulated vaginal fluid, with a pH adjusted to 4.5, as previously described (Pan et\u00a0al., 2019 ), was employed. Faecal and vaginal samples were cultivated for 19 and 24\u2009h, respectively, under anaerobic conditions at 37\u00b0C. Furthermore, for each of the two matrices, samples were cultured in the presence and absence of 2% \u03b1\u2010LA. After cultivation, all samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were processed for DNA extraction and bacterial cell enumeration.    Ethics statement  The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the IRB Alma Res (Approval number 007/2022) and registered on ClinicaTrials.gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier NCT05674318 ). Signed informed consents were obtained from each woman enrolled in the present study and the clinical practice followed the Ethical Principles of the Helsinki Declaration and the national law.    In vivo evaluation of the effect of \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin on vaginal microbiota of PCOS \u2010affected women  Ten patients with clinical signs of PCOS were enrolled for the in\u00a0vivo pilot study at Agunco Obstetric and Gynecologic Centre (Rome, Italy). Specifically, to be enrolled, women had to be on fertile age with a diagnosis of PCOS resulting from (i) menstrual alterations, (ii) polycystic ovary, (iii) biochemical hyperandrogenism (blood levels of testosterone >59\u2009ng/dL or fasting insulin higher than 25 \u03bcUI/m) or (iv) phenotypical hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia and seborrhoea). Instead, exclusion criteria included (i) the assumption of antibiotic therapies, prebiotics and/or probiotics in the month prior sample collection; (ii) concomitant inflammatory diseases (celiac disease, Chron's disease); (iii) pregnancy; (iv) physiological and/or induced menopause; (v) neoplastic diseases; (vi) allergy to milk proteins and (vii) the substance abuse (Escobar\u2010Morreale, 2018 ; Hong et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Witchel et\u00a0al., 2019 ). Specifically, all 10 enrolled patients exhibited ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovary and signs of hyperandrogenism. In addition, clinical practice guidelines to correctly collect the vaginal swab were addressed, including no sexual intercourses, no vaginal solution nor ovules in the previous 24\u2009h. To evaluate the possible impact of orally administrated \u03b1\u2010LA on vaginal microbiota in such patients, all the women underwent a 30\u2010day oral administration of \u03b1\u2010LA (300\u2009mg/twice a day), and two vaginal swabs were collected from each patient: one before (baseline\u2014T0) and one after (T1) \u03b1\u2010LA administration. Immediately after collection, each vaginal swab was transferred into a sterile container with 3\u2009mL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, USA) to avoid alteration in the sample and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until processing.    DNA extraction and Illumina shallow shotgun sequencing  DNA extraction from faecal sample cultivations was performed using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), while the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, USA) was employed for DNA extraction from both vaginal sample cultivations and vaginal swab collected from the in\u00a0vivo study. In both cases, DNA extraction was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the extracted DNA was prepared using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit following the Illumina Nextera XT protocol. Briefly, DNA samples were enzymatically fragmented, barcoded and purified employing magnetic beads. Then, samples were quantified using the fluorometric Qubit quantification system (Life Technologies, USA), loaded on a 2200 Tape Station Instrument (Agilent Technologies, USA) and normalized to 4\u2009nM. A paired\u2010end sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer with MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA).    Analysis of shallow shotgun microbiome data  The obtained .fastq files were filtered to remove reads with an average quality <25 and sequences of human DNA, while reads with a length of >146\u2009bp were retained. Quality\u2010filtered data were used for further analysis with the METAnnotatorX2 pipeline for taxonomic profile reconstruction, as previously described (Milani et\u00a0al., 2021 ). To evaluate whether significant differences occurred in the taxonomic composition of faecal and vaginal samples before and after \u03b1\u2010LA treatment both in in\u00a0vitro experiment and in\u00a0vivo study, a paired Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test was employed. Specifically, for each taxon, abundance differences before and after \u03b1\u2010LA treatment were calculated for each subject and then, the obtained differences were subjected to Wilcoxon singed\u2010rank test calculation. To account for multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was applied to the p \u2010values obtained from the Wilcoxon test. This correction controls the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypotheses, thus providing a more reliable interpretation of statistical significance. Taxa with an adjusted p \u2010value <\u20090.05 were considered significantly different between the two considered groups, indicating a significant impact of \u03b1\u2010LA treatment on their abundance.    Evaluation of bacterial cell density by flow cytometry  For total microbial cell count, each culture/vaginal swab was diluted in physiological solutions (PBS). Subsequently, 1\u2009mL of the obtained bacterial cell suspension was stained with 1\u2009\u03bcL of SYBR Green I (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) (1:100 dilution in dimethylsulfoxide; Sigma, Germany), vortex\u2010mixed and incubated in the dark for at least 15\u2009min before measurement. All count experiments were carried out using the Attune NxT Flow Cytometry (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a blue laser set at 50\u2009mW and tuned at an excitation wavelength of 488\u2009nm. Multiparametric analyses were performed on both scattering signals, that is, forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), while SYBR Green I fluorescence was detected on the BL1 530/30\u2009nm optical detector. Cell debris were excluded from acquisition analyses by setting a BL1 threshold. Furthermore, the gated fluorescence events were evaluated on the forward\u2010sideways density plot to exclude remaining background events and to obtain an accurate microbial cell count, as previously described (Vandeputte et\u00a0al., 2017 ). All data were statistically analysed with the Attune NxT flow cytometry software.    Statistical analyses  QIIME2 was exploited for the assessment of 16S rRNA microbial profiling\u2010based \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity analyses. To assess the impact of time on the variability between samples while accounting for the paired nature of data in case of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo pilot study, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using Bray\u2013Curtis distanc matrices from the taxonomic profile was performed using the \u2018adonis\u2019 function from the vegan package (version 2.5\u20137) through RStudios ( http://www.rstudio.com/ ). Furthermore, to evaluate whether results obtained for the two pooled\u2010analysis may be affected by bioproject biases, a linear mixed model was employed to analyse data with fixed effects representing the two\u2010condition group and random effects accounting for the bioprojects. The statistical analysis was performed using the lme4 and dplyr packages using RStudio. SPSS software ( www.ibm.com/software/it/analytics/spss ) was used to compute the non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test and the ANOVA statistics. The false discovery rate (FDR) correction based on Benjamini and Hochberg correction (Benjamini et\u00a0al., 2001 ) and calculated using RStudio through \u2018 p .adjust\u2019 function (from base package stats) was applied to statistically significant results.     RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Selection of public data sets  To evaluate possible differences in the taxonomic composition of the intestinal and vaginal microbiota between healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women, a pooled\u2010analysis was performed based on publicly available microbiome data sets. Specifically, as a reduced number of studies investigated the faecal and/or vaginal microbiota of women affected by PCOS through shotgun metagenomics, the pooled\u2010analysis was performed considering only faecal and vaginal samples analysed through 16S rRNA gene microbial profiling to obtain a large number of samples and avoid biases related to the use of different sequencing techniques (Tables 1 and S1 ). For this purpose, an in\u2010depth literature search was carried out to retrieve microbiome data sets based on Illumina sequencing technology corresponding to faecal and vaginal samples from both healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women. In detail, in case of longitudinal studies, only one sample per subject was considered to avoid the inclusion of redundant samples, while for studies encompassing the administration of drugs, hormones, prebiotics and/or probiotics, only faecal and vaginal samples from the pre\u2010treatment and/or control groups were selected. In addition, to prevent biases associated with other pathologies, only faecal and vaginal samples from women with no diseases other than PCOS were considered. Overall, this literature survey allowed to select a total of 665 publicly available samples, divided into 391 (216 and 175 from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women) and 274 (140 and 134 from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women) faecal and vaginal samples, respectively (Table S1 ). Furthermore, to avoid software\u2010related biases, all samples were re\u2010analysed through the QIIME2 software pipeline (Bokulich et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Caporaso et\u00a0al., 2010 ) generating a total of 39,058,882 reads with an average of 58,735 reads per sample, reduced to a total of 29,032,727 reads with an average of 43,658 reads per sample after quality filtering (Table S2 ).    Pooled\u2010analysis of the faecal microbiota of PCOS\u2010affected women  To investigate possible alterations in the faecal microbial ecosystem correlated to PCOS, the taxonomic composition of the selected publicly available faecal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women were compared.  The \u03b1\u2010diversity analysis, calculated both through the observed ASVs and Shannon indexes, revealed a higher complexity of the intestinal microbiota of healthy women when compared to those affected by PCOS, although only the Shannon index highlighted a statistically significant increment (Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test p \u2010value of 0.085 and 0.034 for ASVs and Shannon index, respectively) (Figure 1 ). In parallel, a Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity\u2010based \u03b2\u2010diversity analysis, represented through a PCoA, showed significant compositional differences between the two groups (PERMANOVA p \u2010value <\u20090.001) (Figure 1 ). These results suggest that PCOS seems to correlate not only with a reduced intestinal microbial complexity but also with a modulation of the taxonomic composition of the human gut microbiota.   FIGURE 1   Exploration of the diversity and bacterial composition of the gut microbiota of healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women. Panel (A) displays the box and whisker plots of the alpha\u2010diversity calculated through the observed ASV index and the Shannon index of the two clinical groups. The x \u2010axis reports the two considered clinical groups, while the y \u2010axis shows the number of the observed ASVs or Shannon values. Boxes are determined by the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the whiskers are determined by the maximum and minimum values and correspond to the box extreme values. Lines inside the boxes represent the average, while crosses correspond to the median. Panel (B) depicts the three\u2010dimensional Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u2010based PCoA of the selected faecal samples. Panel (C) highlights the average relative abundance (>0.5%) of the bacterial genera that significantly differ in the gut microbiota of healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women.     In this context, in\u2010depth insights into the taxonomic composition of faecal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women revealed that the relative abundance of 27 bacterial taxa, including two of the main representative bacterial genera of the human gut microbiota, significantly differed between the two groups, based on the Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) (Figure 1A\u2013C and Table S3 ). Specifically, while the average relative abundance of the genus Bacteroides displayed a significant increment in the faecal microbiota of women with PCOS, the genus Prevotella showed an opposite trend with a concomitant prevalence reduction (Figure 1 and Table S3 ). Thus, suggesting that PCOS is strictly associated with an alteration in the average relative abundance of some of the highly abundant microbial genera colonizing the human gut (Arumugam et\u00a0al., 2011 ; Costea et\u00a0al., 2018 ). At the same time, focusing the attention on those bacterial taxa known to exert either beneficial of detrimental effects upon their host, another abundant and prevalent bacterial taxon, that is, Faecalibacterium , showed a twofold increase of the average relative abundance in the faecal samples from healthy women when compared to the PCOS\u2010affected ones (Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test p \u2010value <\u20090.001) (Figure 1 and Table S3 ). This microbial genus has attracted particular interest from the scientific community for the ability of certain members of this taxon, that is, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , to exert several beneficial effects upon the host. Indeed, this species not only displays anti\u2010inflammatory features, but being a butyrogenic microorganism, it also produces butyrate that can be favourably exploited by the intestinal epithelial cells as growth substrate enhancing the epithelial barrier integrity and mucosal immunity (Kazmierczak\u2010Siedlecka et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Lopez\u2010Siles et\u00a0al., 2017 ; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022a ). Not by chance, F. prausnitzii is considered as a biomarker of gut health as its depletion is associated with several pathological disorders (De Filippis et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Leylabadlo et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Lopez\u2010Siles et\u00a0al., 2017 ), including inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as colorectal cancer and diabetes (Cao et\u00a0al., 2014 ). In this context, the reduced abundance of this bacterial taxon in the faecal samples from PCOS\u2010affected women may be considered as one of the markers for this pathology, also considering that women with PCOS may have a higher risk of developing IBD (Mathur et\u00a0al., 2010 ).  Conversely, two bacterial genera encompassing members widely recognized as potential pathogens, that is, Escherichia\u2010Shigella and Fusobacterium , possessed a higher abundance and prevalence in the faecal samples of PCOS\u2010affected women than those from the healthy controls (Figure 1 and Table S3 ). Specifically, Fusobacterium , especially the species Fusobacterium nucleatum , has been associated with a plethora of diseases, including IBD and colorectal cancer, for its ability to stimulate a pro\u2010inflammatory status (Engevik et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Gurung et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Wong & Yu, 2019 ). Therefore, the higher abundance of this genus in faecal samples of women with PCOS corroborates its involvement in human diseases and suggests its potential role in contributing to the stimulation of an intestinal inflammatory condition typical of this syndrome (Abraham Gnanadass et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Armanini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Gurung et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Wong & Yu, 2019 ). Furthermore, unexpectedly, a bacterial taxon including some members able to exert beneficial effects upon the human host, that is, the genus Bifidobacterium , resulted to be more abundant and prevalent in the faecal samples of women with PCOS with respect to the healthy ones (Figure 1 and Table S3 ). However, the different variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplified for the taxonomic profiling of faecal samples among the various studies included in this pooled\u2010analysis may have influenced such observation. Not by chance, samples obtained from the only two studies that targeted the V1\u2010V2\u2010V3 regions (Table 1 ), known to underestimate the genus Bifidobacterium (Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Turroni et\u00a0al., 2009 ), resulted to be completely depleted of the above\u2010mentioned taxon (Table S4 ). Based on this bias, the statistical analysis was recalculated by eliminating the faecal samples of the two bio\u2010projects. The updated results revealed a slightly higher average relative abundance in the faecal samples from healthy women compared to the PCOS\u2010affected ones, even though not statistically significant ( p \u2010value\u2009=\u20090.790) (Table S4 ). However, further investigations with a large set of samples analysed with the same primer pair may clarify this hypothesis. Additional detail concerning the evaluation of possible bioproject\u2010related effects can be found in the Supplementary Text .  Overall, these results highlighted that the gut microbiota of PCOS\u2010affected women is characterized by a reduced abundance of beneficial microorganisms with a concomitant increment of certain opportunistic pathogens.    Pooled\u2010analysis of the vaginal microbiota of women with PCOS  As for faecal samples, to evaluate the correlation between PCOS and changes in the taxonomic composition of the vaginal microbiota, publicly available 16S rRNA gene microbial profiling\u2010based vaginal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women were re\u2010analysed.  The \u03b1\u2010diversity analysis, based on the ASV and Shannon indexes, highlighted that the microbial complexity of the vaginal samples from PCOS\u2010affected women is significantly higher compared to the healthy ones in which it resulted to be drastically and significantly reduced (Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test p \u2010value <\u20090.001 for both indexes) (Figure 2A\u2013C ). This is a common condition to several other urogenital diseases such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and urinary tract or human papillomavirus infections (Deka et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Gao et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Lev\u2010Sagie et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Liu et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021b ). At the same time, the \u03b2\u2010diversity analysis represented through a PCoA, revealed significant differences in the biodiversity of samples between the two clinical conditions (PERMANOVA p \u2010value <\u20090.001) (Figure 2 ). Thus, a significant increase of the complexity of the vaginal microbial ecosystem coupled with a diverse taxonomic composition was observed, indicating drastic alterations in the vaginal microbiota in presence of such syndrome.   FIGURE 2   Evaluation of the diversity and bacterial composition of the vaginal microbiota between healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women. Panel (A) shows the box and whisker plots of the \u03b1\u2010diversity calculated through the observed ASV index and Shannon index of the two clinical groups. The x \u2010axis displays the two considered clinical groups, while the y \u2010axis shows the number of the observed ASVs or Shannon values. Boxes are delimited by the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the whiskers are determined by the maximum and minimum values and correspond to the box extreme values. The crosses inside the boxes correspond to the median, while the lines represent the average. Panel (B) reports the three\u2010dimensional Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u2010based PCoA of the selected vaginal samples. Panel (C) displays the average relative abundance of the bacterial genera that significantly vary between the vaginal microbiota of healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women.     In this context, to investigate possible microbial markers associated with PCOS, a non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test corrected for multiple correction was applied to the selected samples (Table S5 ). Interestingly, the average relative abundance of the most representative bacterial genus of the vaginal microbiota, that is, Lactobacillus , is markedly reduced in PCOS\u2010affected women (average relative abundance of 60.30%) when compared to the healthy ones (87.35%) (Figure 2 and Table S5 ). Such result could be considered as a first clear sign of a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota in case of PCOS, as Lactobacillus species generally correlate with a healthy vaginal environment. Indeed, members of this bacterial genus may limit, by competitive exclusion, the proliferation of potential pathogens through the release of bacteriostatic/bactericidal compounds and/or lactic acid production lowering the environmental pH (Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Deka et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Fontana et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021a ; Parolin et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Scillato et\u00a0al., 2021 ). In parallel, the average relative abundance of various potential pathogens commonly involved in vaginal infections, that is, Atopobium , Gardnerella , Megasphaera , Mycoplasma , Mobiluncus and Prevotella , significantly increased in the vaginal microbiota of women with PCOS with respect to the healthy ones (Figure 2 and Table S5 ) (Abou Chacra et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Muzny et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Saraf et\u00a0al., 2021 ). In this context, the drastic reduction of the genus Lactobacillus may have induced lactic acid depletion with a concomitant increment of the vaginal environment pH leading to the overgrowth of the above\u2010mentioned anaerobic bacteria (Muzny et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Saraf et\u00a0al., 2021 ). Therefore, PCOS results to be characterized by important alterations in the vaginal microbiota towards a dysbiotic status, which is characterized by a disproportional growth of anaerobic pathogens at the expense of members of the health\u2010related Lactobacillus genus.  Overall, these results highlighted profound changes in the vaginal microbiota of women affected by PCOS respect to the healthy ones, with important changes in both complexity and biodiversity of the vaginal microbial ecosystem.  Therefore, considering the observed alterations in both intestinal and vaginal microbiota in women with PCOS when compared to healthy controls, the identification of natural molecules able to restore such dysbiotic condition could be an attractive and useful strategy for improving the management of the syndrome.    Effect of \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin on Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strain growth performances  \u03b1\u2010LA, a whey globular protein of the mammalian milk, is largely used as dietary supplement not only for its high\u2010water solubility, heat stability and low immunogenicity in comparison with other milk allergens, but also for its multiple beneficial effects. Indeed, bioactive peptides generated from the \u03b1\u2010LA proteolytic digestion exert antibacterial, anti\u2010inflammatory, analgesic, antihypertensive and immunomodulatory actions (Boscaini et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2019b ; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022b ). Recently, \u03b1\u2010LA has been proposed as a compound with prebiotic features able to prevent or recover intestinal dysbiosis inducing an increment in the relative abundance of certain beneficial microorganisms such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains (Boscaini et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Chen et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Li et\u00a0al., 2019b ). In this context, as the pooled\u2010analysis highlighted that PCOS correlates with a reduced abundance of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the intestinal and vaginal microbial ecosystem, respectively, the possible positive influence of \u03b1\u2010LA on the growth performances of members of the two above\u2010mentioned bacterial taxa was evaluated. Specifically, 17 Bifidobacterium and 11 Lactobacillus strains isolated from human faecal and vaginal samples, respectively, were grown in presence of three different concentrations of \u03b1\u2010LA, that is, 1%, 2% and 3%, as well as in the absence of this or other additional proteins (control sample) (Table 2 ). In detail, the strains were selected to test at least one strain for each of the most representative Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species of the human intestinal and vaginal microbiota, respectively (Derrien et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021b ). Furthermore, an outlier for each bacterial genus was included in the analysis, that is, Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 20533 and Bifidobacterium asteroides LMG 10735.  Interestingly, all tested strains displayed significant higher growth performances when cultivated for 48\u2009h on \u03b1\u2010LA if compared to the control condition, except for L. iners LMG 14328 that showed an opposite trend. Specifically, the microbial growth seemed, in almost all cases, to increase significantly with increasing \u03b1\u2010LA concentration (one\u2010way ANOVA p \u2010value <\u20090.05) (Figure 3A,B and Table S6 ). This suggests that this milk protein may act as a prebiotic growth substrate for members of the genus Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus enhancing their growth. However, although an increase in growth performances was observed for each strain, only eight strains, that is, Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 9857, Bifidobacterium adolescentis 703B, B. adolescentis 713B, Bifidobacterium bifidum LMG 11041, B. bifidum PRL2010, Bifidobacterium breve LMG 13208, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum 289B and B. pseudocatenulatum 318B, exhibited at least a twofold OD 600nm increment when cultivated on MRS supplemented with any of the three tested \u03b1\u2010LA concentrations with respect to the control condition (Figure 3 ). This result indicated that the ability to use \u03b1\u2010LA as a growth substrate is strain specific. Probably, depending on their genetic makeup, some strains can degrade \u03b1\u2010LA into a wider range of peptides and/or amino acids, which can be favourably exploited as additional growth substrate.   FIGURE 3   Growth performances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains on \u03b1\u2010LA. Panels (A) and (B) show the box and whisker plots of the growth performances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains, respectively, measured as OD 600nm . The x \u2010axis identifies the bacterial strains and the \u03b1\u2010LA concentration (1%, 2% and 3%) coupled with the control condition (MRS without the addition of \u03b1\u2010LA), while the y \u2010axis displays the OD 600nm measure. Boxes are determined by the 25th and 75th percentiles. The whiskers are delimited by the maximum and minimum values and correspond to the box extreme values. Lines inside the boxes represent the average, while the squares indicate the median.     Of note, while all tested bifidobacterial strains, except for B. longum LMG 13197, exhibited an increase in growth performances of almost twofold with 3% \u03b1\u2010LA with respect to the control, Lactobacillus strains displayed a variable behaviour depending on the species. Indeed, only Lactobacillus crispatus and L. gasseri strains exhibited a 2\u2010fold OD 600nm increase in presence of 3% \u03b1\u2010LA, while L. iners and L. jensenii strains displayed reduced growth performances (Figure 3 ). Considering that several evidence report L. crispatus and L. gasseri as positive microbial biomarkers associated with vaginal health, the ability of \u03b1\u2010LA to favour their growth strengthens the assumed prebiotic features of such protein (Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Chee et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Fontana et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Tachedjian et\u00a0al., 2017 ). At the same time, the inhibition of L. iners suggests a possible use of \u03b1\u2010LA as a compound to limit the growth of this controversial Lactobacillus species. Indeed, despite its dominance in the vaginal microbiota of a large number of healthy women, it may also act as an opportunistic pathogen participating in a high number of bacterial vaginosis (Sabbatini et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2019 , 2021 ). As a matter of fact, a vaginal microbiota dominated by L. iners offers less protection against vaginal dysbiosis and the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis, sexually transmitted infections (including human papilloma virus infections) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (Mitra et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2021 ). However, a larger number of L. iners strains are required to validate this hypothesis.  Overall, these results highlighted that \u03b1\u2010LA may be a valid compound to be administrated with the aim to favour the growth of beneficial bacteria such as members of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus that are able to use such molecule as a prebiotic substrate.    In vitro evaluation of \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin impact on female intestinal and vaginal microbiota  To investigate whether \u03b1\u2010LA may have a positive impact also on complex microbial community, faecal and vaginal samples collected from 10 healthy women were cultivated in a human intestinal and vaginal environment\u2010simulating growth media for 19 and 24\u2009h, respectively, in presence and absence of 2% \u03b1\u2010LA. In detail, although the prebiotic effect of \u03b1\u2010LA seemed to increase with increasing concentration, as demonstrated above for members of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus , for the following in\u00a0vitro experiments, a concentration of 2% \u03b1\u2010LA was selected to mimic carbohydrate\u2010based growth assays that generally test the bacterial ability to grow on a specific glycan substrate with a concentration ranging from 0.5% to 2% (Alessandri et\u00a0al., 2022a ; Lugli et\u00a0al., 2019 ; McLaughlin et\u00a0al., 2015 ; Watson et\u00a0al., 2013 ). After cultivation, growth performances of each sample were assessed through flow cytometry\u2010based bacterial cell enumeration. Interestingly, the number of bacterial cells was significantly higher in presence of \u03b1\u2010LA for both faecal (average bacterial count of 2.03E+09 cells/mL) and vaginal (average bacterial count of 1.20E+08 cells/mL) samples when compared to the control groups (average bacterial count of 1.41E+09 cells/mL and 6.70E+07 cells/mL for faecal and vaginal samples, respectively) (paired Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction p \u2010value <\u20090.01for both samples types) (Figure 4A\u2013E and Table S7 ). Thus, suggesting that this protein may have a role in improving the growth performances of certain bacterial taxa.   FIGURE 4   Effect of \u03b1\u2010LA on female intestinal and vaginal microbiota. Panel (A) and (B) show bar plots (on the left) and box and whisker plots (on the right) related to the bacterial cell enumeration of each cultivated intestinal and vaginal sample, respectively, in the presence and absence of \u03b1\u2010LA and the average of the bacterial counts per group. Panel (C) reports the three\u2010dimensional Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u2010based PCoA associated with the taxonomic profiles of both intestinal and vaginal microbiota of 10 healthy women cultivated with and without \u03b1\u2010LA. Panel (D) and (E) display the taxonomic profiles obtained through shallow shotgun sequencing after culturing intestinal and vaginal samples, respectively, from 10 healthy women in presence and absence of \u03b1\u2010LA. Only bacterial species cited in the text were highlighted.     Furthermore, to evaluate whether the exposure to \u03b1\u2010LA may also play a role in the modulation of the taxonomic composition of intestinal and vaginal microbiota, the above\u2010mentioned cultures were also subjected to DNA extraction and species\u2010level taxonomic profiling through shallow shotgun metagenomics. The sequencing resulted in a total of 4,521,317 reads, reduced to 2,319,965 reads with an average of 57,999 reads per sample after quality filtering (Table S8 ).  As expected, a Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity\u2010based \u03b2\u2010diversity analysis revealed a clear separation of samples based on their origin, that is, faecal or vaginal samples (Figure 4B ). However, neither the faecal nor the vaginal control samples clustered separately from the corresponding \u03b1\u2010LA\u2010treated samples (Figure 4B ). Thus, suggesting that the exposure to \u03b1\u2010LA did not induce any significant drastic change in the biodiversity of samples, as observed by the calculation of PERMANOVA using the Adonis function ( R  2 of 0.01023 and 0.0031 for faecal and vaginal samples, respectively, and PERMANOVA p \u2010value >0.05 for both sample types). An observation that can be considered as a positive factor since an excessive bacterial upheaval could cause dysbiosis. Indeed, considering that the analysed microbial samples derived from healthy individuals, observing that \u03b1\u2010LA administration does not subvert the architecture of the microbiota, instead it rebalances some alterations, could be an advantageous aspect of safety towards the microbiota physiology.  In addition, although in depth insights into the taxonomic profiles revealed no significant differences neither for faecal nor for vaginal samples between the control and treated group (paired Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction p \u2010value >0.05 for all comparisons) (Table S9 ), probably due to the high heterogenicity of the samples, the analysis of the sequencing data highlighted interesting trend with members of the most representative bacterial genera of the human gut microbiota, that is, Alistipes , Bacteroides , Parabacteroides and Phocaeicola that underwent a decrease in relative abundance if cultivated in presence of \u03b1 \u2010LA when compared to the control (Figure 4C and Table S9 ) (Arumugam et\u00a0al., 2011 ; Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2017 ). On the other side, although with some exceptions, species of the genus Bifidobacterium , including B. adolescentis , B. breve , Bifidobacterium catenulatum , B. longum , B. pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium ruminantium displayed an increased relative abundance in faecal samples grown in the presence of \u03b1 \u2010LA when compared to the control (Figure 4C and Table S9 ). In this context, as certain members of the genus Bifidobacterium are well recognized as microorganisms exerting multiple beneficial effects upon their host, their observed higher relative abundance in the faecal samples cultivated with \u03b1 \u2010LA indicates that this protein may have a bifidogenic effect, also confirming the above\u2010mentioned prebiotic feature of \u03b1 \u2010LA towards members of the genus Bifidobacterium (Alessandri et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Bottacini et\u00a0al., 2017 ; Hidalgo\u2010Cantabrana et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Interestingly, beyond bifidobacteria, also Prevotella copri , a bacterial species currently described as a new generation probiotic, displayed an increased relative abundance when exposed to \u03b1\u2010LA, leading to assume that this protein may exert a prebiotic effect also stimulating the growth of this new generation probiotic (Figure 4D and Table S9 ) (Abenavoli et\u00a0al., 2020 ; De Filippis et\u00a0al., 2022 ).  Similarly, the analysis of data related to the growth performances of vaginal samples in presence and absence of \u03b1 \u2010LA revealed alterations in the main bacterial representatives of the vaginal microbiota, even if not statistically significant (paired Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction p \u2010value >0.05 for all comparisons) (Figure 4D and Table S9 ). Interestingly, in all the vaginal samples with a high relative abundance (>10%), except for sample 3, L. crispatus showed better growth performances in presence of \u03b1 \u2010LA (Figure 4D and Table S9 ). This suggests the ability of the tested protein to stimulate the growth of this healthy vaginal environment\u2010associated microbial taxon, thus corroborating results on single strains of L. crispatus on \u03b1 \u2010LA. Conversely, L. iners displayed a reduced relative abundance in vaginal samples grown on \u03b1 \u2010LA when compared to the control, except for sample 2 in which this species is mostly stable between the control and the treated sample (Figure 4D and Table S9 ). Interestingly, the vaginal sample 4, when cultivated in absence of \u03b1 \u2010LA resulted to be dominated by L. iners whose relative abundance drastically decreased in presence of \u03b1 \u2010LA, favouring the overgrowth of L. gasseri , one of the Lactobacillus species generally abundant in the vaginal microbiota of healthy women (Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Ravel et\u00a0al., 2011 ). In this context, although it represents a dominant species of the vaginal microbiota as L. crispatus , the role of L. iners is controversial. Plenty of evidence reported a crucial role of L. iners \u2010dominated microbiota in predisposing the ecological niche to pathogen invasion. Indeed, even if it is considered as a common symbiont of the vaginal microbiota of healthy women, it may also act as an opportunistic pathogen participating in a high number of bacterial vaginosis (Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021b ; Sanozky\u2010Dawes & Barrangou, 2022 ; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2021 ) or correlating with the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections as in the case of human papilloma virus (Zeng et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Therefore, these data suggest that \u03b1 \u2010LA may have a role in maintaining stable/limiting the proliferation of L. iners and thus avoiding the occurrence of some adverse clinical conditions related to this bacterial species. Similarly, \u03b1 \u2010LA did not seem to favour the growth of another opportunistic pathogen of the vaginal microbiota, that is, Gardnerella vaginalis , whose relative abundance remained stable between the control and treated sample (Figure 4D and Table S9 ). However, this species was present in only one of the 10 analysed vaginal samples. Therefore, a higher number of samples comprising G. vaginalis is required to validate this hypothesis.  Overall, for both faecal and vaginal samples, \u03b1 \u2010LA seems to exert a prebiotic effect for certain positive and health\u2010promoting species of the intestinal and vaginal microbiota, including members of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus , while limiting the growth of (possible) opportunistic pathogens.    Effect of \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin on the vaginal microbiota of women with PCOS   Based on the in\u00a0vitro results, an in\u00a0vivo pilot study further evaluated the positive impact of the administration of \u03b1 \u2010LA on the vaginal microbiota of women affected by PCOS. Specifically, 10 women with clinical signs of PCOS were enrolled and privately followed at Agunco Obstetric and Gynecologic Centre (Rome, Italy), following the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration and the national law.  All the enrolled women exhibited at least two of the three Rotterdam Criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS (Rotterdam, 2004 ), in particular phenotypical hyperandrogenism and ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovaries. All patients were orally administered with \u03b1 \u2010LA (300\u2009mg twice a day) for 30\u2009days, and for each subject a vaginal swab was collected before (T0\u2014baseline) and after (T1) \u03b1 \u2010LA treatment (Figure 5A ).   FIGURE 5   \u03b1\u2010LA impact on the vaginal microbiota of PCOS\u2010affected women. Panel (A) shows the time line of the experimental procedures of the in\u00a0vivo pilot study. Panel (B) displays the flow cytometry\u2010based bacterial cell count of the vaginal swab collected from the 10 women enrolled in the in\u00a0vivo pilot study at time points T0 and T1, while panel (C) reports the box and whisker plot of the average of the bacterial cell count per considered time points. The x \u2010axis shows the two time points, while the y \u2010axis reports the number of bacterial cells. Panel (D) depicts the box and whisker plot of the average number of bacterial species detected in the collected vaginal swabs divided per time points. The x \u2010axis shows the two time points, while the y \u2010axis reports the number of bacterial species. In both box and whisker plots, boxes are determined by the 25th and 75th percentiles. The whiskers are determined by the maximum and minimum values and correspond to the box extreme values. Lines inside the boxes represent the average, while crosses correspond to the median. Panel (E) depicts the three\u2010dimensional Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index\u2010based PCoA of the 20 vaginal swabs collected before and after 30\u2009days of \u03b1\u2010LA administration, while panel (F) reports the shallow shogun\u2010based taxonomic profiles of the vaginal microbiota of the 10 women suffering from PCOS before and after \u03b1\u2010LA treatment.     To evaluate whether the administration of \u03b1 \u2010LA may have a role in modulating the total bacterial load of the vaginal microbiota, the vaginal swabs were subjected to a flow cytometry\u2010based total bacterial cell count. In detail, in all cases, except for samples F, I and L, a higher total bacterial count was recorded at T0 when compared to T1 (Figure 5B and Table S10 ), suggesting that the administration of this milk\u2010derived protein may in\u00a0vivo reduce the bacterial load of the vaginal microbiota. However, although the average total bacterial cell count at T0 was almost 10 times higher than that at T1 (average bacterial cell count of 1.13E+08 cells/mL and 1.93E+07 cells/mL, respectively) (Figure 5C ), the observed difference was not statistically significant (paired Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction p \u2010value\u2009=\u20090.105), probably due to the high heterogeneity of the collected samples in terms of total bacterial count.  Furthermore, to assess whether the administration of \u03b1 \u2010LA may modulate the taxonomic composition of PCOS\u2010affected women vaginal microbiota, the 20 collected vaginal swabs were subjected to a taxonomic profile using shallow shotgun sequencing, generating a total of 142,935 filtered reads with an average of 7147 reads per sample (Table S11 ). Based on the obtained taxonomic results, the species richness analysis revealed no significant differences in the average number of species detected in the vaginal samples of women suffering from PCOS between T0 and T1 (Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test p \u2010value\u2009=\u20090.909) (Figure 5D ). Similarly, a Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity\u2010based \u03b2\u2010diversity analysis represented through a PCoA did not show significant changes in the vaginal bacterial composition between T0 and T1 ( R  2 =\u20090.00764 and PERMANOVA p \u2010value >0.05) (Figure 5E ). Thus, suggesting that, as observed for total bacterial load, \u03b1 \u2010LA administration does not induce drastic/major shifts either in the species richness or biodiversity of the vaginal microbiota of women suffering from PCOS. However, although no appreciable alterations were observed in the biodiversity of the vaginal microbiota of PCOS\u2010affected women after 30\u2009days of \u03b1 \u2010LA treatment, possible differences in the taxonomic profiles between T0 and T1 were investigated. In detail, although no significant differences emerged in the average relative abundance of the detected bacterial species between T0 and T1 (paired Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction p \u2010value >0.05 for all species), certain trends were observed between the two examined time points. Interestingly, the relative abundance of L. crispatus , when present, remained stable (for samples A and E) or even increased (for samples B, C, F, H and I) (Figure 5F ). In this context, as this species is considered as a crucial positive microbial biomarker in the vaginal environment due to its claimed beneficial implications on vaginal health (Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Chee et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021a ), it can be assumed that the intake of \u03b1 \u2010LA can have a positive effect on the host health favouring the persistence of this species in the vaginal environment. Similarly, L. jensenii and L. gasseri , other two predominant Lactobacillus species generally related to a healthy vaginal microbiota, as also above\u2010mentioned (Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021b ), displayed an increased relative abundance in T1 respect to T0, except for sample F and D, respectively, where the two species showed an opposite trend (Figure 5F ). These data indicate that \u03b1 \u2010LA may have a beneficial effect favouring an increase in the abundance of health\u2010promoting Lactobacillus species, even if with some exceptions. On the other side, in both samples in which it was detected, the opportunistic pathogen L. iners underwent a slight decrease in its relative abundance at T1 (Figure 5F ), suggesting that \u03b1 \u2010LA may act maintaining/limiting the abundance of this controversial species potentially preventing its overgrowth and confirming the above obtained in\u00a0vitro results (Mancabelli et\u00a0al., 2021b ; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2021 ).  In parallel, the opportunistic pathogen G. vaginalis showed, in all three cases in which it was present, a relative abundance reduction after 1\u2009month of \u03b1 \u2010LA administration, denoting that this protein may have a role in limiting the growth and proliferation of this pathogenic bacterium. Similarly, even if present in a single sample, Prevotella bivia , another pathogenic microorganism strictly associated with vaginal infection, showed a decreased relative abundance after \u03b1\u2010LA intake (Figure 5F ). In addition, even if they showed a reduced relative abundance (<1%), members of the genus Mobiluncus and Porphyromonas uenonis generally known as opportunistic pathogens of the vaginal tract, underwent a relative abundance reduction in sample H at T1 respect to T0 (Figure 5F ) (Argentini et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Barczynski et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Mohankumar et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Overall, these results allowed for the first time to hypothesize that this protein may have a role in reducing the abundance/limiting the growth of potential pathogens while favouring the proliferation of health\u2010promoting bacteria not only in in\u00a0vitro but also in in\u00a0vivo conditions. Up to date, only a few studies evaluated the effects of an oral supplementation on vaginal microbiota composition and, as far as we know, they all concerned probiotics rather than natural molecules with prebiotic activity, as the \u03b1\u2010LA (Ansari et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Reid et\u00a0al., 2001 , 2003 ; Yang et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Overall, these results not only corroborate the potential prebiotic role of this milk\u2010derived protein in treating the microbial alterations in the vaginal microbiota typical of PCOS\u2010affected women, but they also allow this molecule to be nominated as a possible strategy to alleviate/limit the dysbiotic condition associated with PCOS, regardless of phenotypes or hyperandrogenic/norm androgenic profile of the PCOS\u2010affected patients.  Of course, in our study a higher number of samples is needed to achieve statistical power and to validate the potential beneficial effect of \u03b1\u2010LA in modulating the vaginal microbiota of women with PCOS towards a healthy microbiota. However, considering the alterations in the intestinal and vaginal microbiota typical of PCOS\u2010affected women, strengthening the potential prebiotic role of the \u03b1\u2010LA could pave the way for improving the management of the syndrome by restoring dysbiotic microbiota.     CONCLUSIONS  Considering the impact of PCOS on both life quality and health, in the last decades, the scientific community has focused particular attention on understanding mechanisms triggering this syndrome with the aim to identify potential solutions to prevent/treat PCOS symptoms. However, the hypothesis of the involvement of intestinal and vaginal microbiota in the onset of the syndrome has been postulated only in recent years. Indeed, still little evidence highlight the association between the intestinal/vaginal microbial ecosystems and PCOS. In this context, our pooled\u2010analysis, performed by re\u2010analysing the publicly available 16S rRNA microbial profiling of faecal and vaginal samples from healthy and PCOS\u2010affected women, shed light on the possible correlation between variations in gut and vaginal microbiota and PCOS. This analysis revealed that this syndrome was characterized by a dysbiotic condition with a reduction of beneficial bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium for the gut microbiota and Lactobacillus for the vaginal environment, and a concomitant enrichment of potential pathogens, encompassing Escherichia and Fusobacterium for the intestinal microbial ecosystem and Atopobium , Gardnerella , Megasphaera , Mycoplasma , Mobiluncus and Prevotella for the vaginal microbiota.  Furthermore, the in\u00a0vitro evaluation of the potential \u2018prebiotic\u2019 feature of \u03b1\u2010LA highlighted its ability to improve the growth performances of members of two health\u2010promoting bacterial genera that are depleted in the intestinal and vaginal microbiota of PCOS\u2010affected women, that is, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus , respectively, and to modulate the taxonomic composition of both gut and vaginal microbial ecosystems. Finally, an in\u00a0vivo pilot study based on the oral supplementation of \u03b1\u2010LA for 30\u2009days to women suffering from PCOS corroborated results from the in\u00a0vitro experiments, revealing that \u03b1\u2010LA administration seemed to maintain stable/favour the overgrowth of health\u2010promoting bacteria, including L. crispatus , L. gasseri and L. jensenii , while limiting the growth of potential vaginal pathogens. However, the results obtained from the enumeration of bacterial cells in vaginal samples from the in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments were in contrast. Indeed, while a significant increase in the number of bacterial cells was recorded in case of in\u00a0vitro cultivation of vaginal samples with \u03b1\u2010LA when compared to the control samples, in the in\u00a0vivo pilot study, even if not statistically significant, an opposite trend was observed. Probably, while in the former case the milk\u2010derived protein was added directly to the medium and was, therefore, completely bioavailable as a prebiotic substrate thus possibly favouring bacterial growth, in the latter case several variables come into play preventing knowing the real concentration of protein that reaches the different human districts and whether if this concentration varies among individuals. Naturally, also the low numbers of enrolled individuals and the short term of the analysis may represent limitations to these obtained preliminary clinical results.  Overall, these results emphasized the strict association between PCOS and a dysbiotic intestinal and vaginal microbiota, when compared to those from healthy women, thus also strengthening the hypothesis that these two microbial ecosystems are involved in the pathogenesis of this syndrome, confirming the DOGMA theory previously proposed when considering PCOS. Therefore, besides reinforcing the importance of taking into account intestinal and vaginal microbial alterations in the management of PCOS, these results also highlight, for the first time, the potential prebiotic activity of \u03b1\u2010LA in restoring/limiting the dysbiotic intestinal/vaginal environment associated with this syndrome. Indeed, obtained results suggest that \u03b1\u2010LA may play a role in limiting PCOS\u2010related microbial alterations in the vaginal and gut microbiota, regardless of PCOS phenotypes or hyperandrogenic/norm androgenic profile and in promoting the growth of bacteria with beneficial effects on the human host. Certainly, these preliminary data should be confirmed with further analyses and supporting results, including a larger number of samples for both in\u00a0vitro experiment and in\u00a0vivo study to provide mechanistic inside into the role of \u03b1\u2010LA. In addition, the lack of data related to possible changes that the intestinal, and not only the vaginal, microbiota may undergo in women suffering from PCOS after \u03b1\u2010LA treatment, represents a limitation of the present study, but at the same time a suggestion for future designed studies. Indeed, the inclusion of this data, along with the evaluation of the possible modulation of PCOS\u2010related symptoms after \u03b1\u2010LA treatment, would have allowed to obtain a global vision of the impact that this protein can have on the dysbiotic intestinal and vaginal microbiota associated with PCOS, possibly validating the obtained in\u00a0vitro results. At the same time, a pilot clinical study that does not exclusively evaluate how the taxonomic composition of the vaginal microbiota is modulated by the administration of \u03b1\u2010LA, but also the possible evolution of PCOS\u2010associated symptoms would provide higher consistency to the beneficial effect provided by this milk\u2010derived protein in PCOS management. Finally, further studies aimed at evaluating whether the vaginal administration of \u03b1\u2010LA can have higher positive effects than oral administration are necessary to define the best route of \u03b1\u2010LA administration in the management of PCOS.  However, the up\u2010to\u2010date recognized ability of \u03b1\u2010LA to improve the absorption of inositols, that is, natural compounds largely used in the management of PCOS, in case of inositol resistance (Cardinale et\u00a0al., 2022 ; Hernandez Marin et\u00a0al., 2021 ; Kamenov et\u00a0al., 2023 ; Lagana et\u00a0al., 2024 ; Montanino Oliva et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Ranaldi et\u00a0al., 2020 ), combined with the obtained results highlighting the potential beneficial effects of this protein in limiting/restoring the vaginal and intestinal dysbiosis typical of the this syndrome, suggest \u03b1\u2010LA as a promising treatment for PCOS.
