In this cross-sectional study of 60\u2009789 participants from the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study, individuals with PCOS had a significantly higher prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions. Longer time to regularity since menarche (adolescence) or irregular cycles (adulthood) were associated with a higher prevalence of several cardiometabolic conditions, even among participants without PCOS, and certain associations were modified by body mass index or physical activity. These findings suggest that early screening of cardiometabolic risk factors and interventions may benefit individuals with longer times to regular menstrual cycles or who experience adulthood irregular cycles, regardless of PCOS diagnosis. This cross-sectional study evaluates the association of polycystic ovary syndrome, timing to regular menstrual cycles, and irregular cycles with cardiometabolic conditions. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, is a common ovulatory disorder. Having an irregular cycle is a potential marker for cardiometabolic conditions, but data are limited on whether the associations differ by PCOS status or potential interventions. To evaluate the association of PCOS, time to regularity since menarche (adolescence), and irregular cycles (adulthood) with cardiometabolic conditions. This cross-sectional study used a large, US-based digital cohort of users of the Apple Research application on their iPhone. Eligibility criteria were having ever menstruated, living in the US, being at age of consent of at least 18 years (or 19 years in Alabama and Nebraska or 21 years in Puerto Rico), and being able to communicate in English. Participants were enrolled between November 14, 2019, and December 13, 2022, and completed relevant surveys. Self-reported PCOS diagnosis, prolonged time to regularity (not spontaneously establishing regularity within 5 years of menarche), and irregular cycles. The primary outcome was self-reported cardiometabolic conditions, including obesity, prediabetes, type 1 and 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart valve disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism measured using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs) and 95% CIs. Effect modification by lifestyle factors was also estimated. The study sample (N\u2009=\u200960\u2009789) had a mean (SD) age of 34.5 (11.1) years, with 12.3% having PCOS and 26.3% having prolonged time to regularity. Among a subset of 25\u2009399 participants who completed the hormonal symptoms survey, 25.6% reported irregular cycles. In covariate-adjusted logistic regression models, PCOS was associated with a higher prevalence of all metabolic and several cardiovascular conditions, eg, arrhythmia (POR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.20-1.55), coronary artery disease (POR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.95-4.29), heart attack (POR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.54), and stroke (POR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.21-2.24). Among participants without PCOS, prolonged time to regularity was associated with type 2 diabetes (POR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46), hypertension (POR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19), arrhythmia (POR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.35), and TIA (POR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.73), and having irregular cycles was associated with type 2 diabetes (POR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.69), high cholesterol (POR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30), arrhythmia (POR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43), and TIA (POR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.26). Some of these associations were modified by high vs low body mass index or low vs high physical activity. These findings suggest that PCOS and irregular cycles may be independent markers for cardiometabolic conditions. Early screening and intervention among individuals with irregular menstrual cycles may be beneficial.",
    "body": "Introduction  The menstrual cycle is an important vital sign beginning in early life. 1 Irregular cycles have been associated with adverse health outcomes. 2 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism, is a common ovulatory disorder affecting 8% to 13% of reproductive-aged females (15-49 years), 3 , 4 but not all individuals with irregular cycles are diagnosed with PCOS (due to underdiagnosis or other etiologies such as hypothalamic amenorrhea). 5 , 6 , 7 , 8  Positive associations have been found between PCOS and cardiometabolic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and stroke. 9 , 10 Previous population-based studies reported positive associations between irregular cycles and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or premature mortality, 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 while other studies did not find such associations. 17 , 18 These studies generally lacked data on PCOS diagnosis or other ovulatory disorders and therefore did not ascertain whether the associations were solely attributable to underlying PCOS or other etiologies that may confer cardiometabolic risk. 19 In addition, most of these studies were limited to menstrual patterns during adulthood. Early-life characteristics, such as time to regularity since menarche, 20 , 21 are important but understudied variables in cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, existing studies were from Europe or of relatively homogeneous or hospital-based populations in the US, and studies on potential early interventions are also lacking. In this study, we evaluated the associations of PCOS, time to regularity (adolescence), and irregular cycles (adulthood) with the prevalence of various cardiometabolic conditions.    Methods   Study Design and Population  This cross-sectional study used data from the Apple Women\u2019s Health Study (AWHS), a prospective, US-based, digital cohort study. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Advarra (CIRB #PRO00037562), and written informed consent was provided at enrollment. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) reporting guideline.  Users of the Apple Research application on their iPhone (Apple Inc) were eligible if they had ever menstruated, were living in the US, were aged at least 18 years (or 19 years in Alabama and Nebraska or 21 years in Puerto Rico), and were able to communicate in English. Eligibility also required sole usage of their iCloud account or iPhone. Enrollment began on November 14, 2019, and is ongoing. Further details were described previously. 22  Upon enrollment, participants were asked to complete 5 surveys to collect data on demographics, medical history, reproductive history, hormonal symptoms, and general health and lifestyle (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 ). We restricted analyses to female participants who enrolled from November 14, 2019, to December 13, 2022, and completed the demographics survey and at least 1 of the 4 remaining surveys. For specific analyses, data were limited to the subset of participants who answered the relevant questions (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 ).    PCOS, Time to Cycle Regularity, and Irregular Cycles  Polycystic ovary syndrome (yes or no) was based on self-reported physician diagnosis at enrollment. Using the survey question, \u201cAfter your first menstrual cycle, how long did it take for your cycle to become regular,\u201d we derived prolonged time to regularity (yes or no), where \u201cyes\u201d included participants who indicated more than 5 years, after using hormones, or not yet regular and \u201cno\u201d included those who reached regularity within 4 years. 23 Other derivations are described in the eMethods in Supplement 1 . We defined irregular cycles as selection of the response unpredictable periods to the survey question, \u201cAre you troubled by any of the following symptoms\u201d (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 ). Hereafter, we use the term irregular cycles to reflect the experience of being troubled by unpredictable menstrual periods. For all exposure variables, don\u2019t know, prefer not to answer, and no response were considered missing.    Cardiometabolic Conditions  At enrollment, we collected data on participant self-report of physician diagnosed cardiometabolic conditions, including prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, heart valve disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater (as measured by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) using self-reported weight and height. We further defined metabolic syndrome using the World Health Organization 1998 criteria with modification based on data availability (details in the eMethods in Supplement 1 ). 24 , 25    Covariates  We included covariates in regression models as potential confounders based on a priori knowledge. All covariates were self-reported at enrollment, including age; race and ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, multiracial, other [American Indian or Alaska Native, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, \u201cnone of these fully describe me\u201d] 26 ) because of their known associations with PCOS, irregular cycles, and cardiometabolic conditions 27 , 28 , 29 ; education (high school or less, college, graduate school); employment status (employed, unemployed, other); socioeconomic status based on the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, 30 a self-rated rank on a social ladder based on self-perception relative to others (0-3 [low], 4-5 [medium], 6-9 [high]); gravidity (0, 1, \u22652); age at menarche (\u226411 years, 12-13 years, 14-15 years, \u226516 years); BMI categories (underweight, <18.5; healthy, 18.5 to <25; overweight, 25 to <30; obesity, \u226530); ever used hormones (yes or no to various forms of hormonal contraception or hormone replacement); and family history of obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes. We acknowledge that some covariates may be downstream factors of the exposures and outcomes with unestablished temporality (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1 ). Thus, we performed 3 models (unadjusted, adjusted only for age and race and ethnicity, and adjusted for all covariates) to assess the robustness of our findings.    Statistical Analysis  As the AWHS is an ongoing study with currently insufficient data on incident cases during follow-up, this cross-sectional analysis uses baseline data (except for time to regularity that reflects the adolescence period). We examined the distributions of all baseline characteristics with mean (SD) and median (IQR) for continuous variables, or counts and percentages for categorical variables. To understand the associations within the key exposure variables, we first used logistic regression models to analyze associations of prolonged time to regularity with PCOS and irregular cycles, respectively. Then, for the associations of PCOS with each prevalent cardiometabolic condition, we used logistic regressions to estimate the prevalence odds ratios (PORs) and 95% CIs using the following models: (1) unadjusted, (2) minimally adjusted for age and race and ethnicity, and (3) adjusted for all covariates. For the associations of prolonged time to regularity or irregular cycles with cardiometabolic conditions, in addition to the full population, we further performed logistic regression analyses stratified by PCOS status. For each regression model, participants with missing exposure, outcome, or covariates were excluded.  For associations between (1) PCOS and cardiometabolic conditions and (2) irregular cycles and cardiometabolic conditions among participants without PCOS, we evaluated the effect modification by BMI (healthy or underweight, overweight, obesity), physical activity (none or light vs moderate, vigorous, or strenuous), and gravidity (0, 1, or \u22652) as exploratory analyses. For each proposed modifier, we tested for effect modification using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) for additive interaction. 31  We performed several exploratory and sensitivity analyses, such as exploring preliminary differences in age at diagnosis of cardiometabolic conditions among participants who reported this information, exploring other ovulatory disorders, such as hypothalamic amenorrhea, based on self-reported characteristics, 32 , 33 and evaluating the validity and stability of our findings. Further details are provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1 .  Data processing and analyses were conducted using Python, version 3.6 (Python Software Foundation) and R, version 1.2.5033 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). All statistical tests were 2-sided with 95% CIs. Significance was defined as an incremental effect for which 95% CI excluded the null and in the case of POR, excluded 1.     Results  Baseline characteristics of the 60\u2009789 participants are shown in Table 1 . Overall, participants had a mean (SD) age of 34.5 (11.1) years. Most were non-Hispanic White (71.4%, compared with 3.2% Asian, 7.3% Hispanic, 5.4% non-Hispanic Black, 10.1% multiracial, and 2.6% other), employed (72.0%), and had obtained some college education or higher (82.9%). Among all participants, 26.3% had prolonged time to regularity, and 12.3% reported diagnosed PCOS. Of 25\u2009399 participants who completed the hormonal symptoms survey, 25.6% reported having irregular cycles. The distributions of covariates among the 60\u2009789 vs 25\u2009399 participants were similar (eTable 2 in Supplement 1 ). Compared with participants without PCOS, those with PCOS had a lower socioeconomic status and gravidity and higher BMI, family history of metabolic conditions, hormone use, and prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions.

Menstrual Cycle Characteristics and PCOS  Table 2 displays the associations of prolonged time to regularity with PCOS and irregular cycles. Longer time to regularity was associated with an increased prevalence of PCOS (unadjusted POR, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.34-3.74) and irregular cycles in adulthood (unadjusted POR, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.78-3.15). The positive association between time to regularity and irregular cycles in adulthood remained among participants without PCOS (unadjusted POR, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.47-2.86). Among participants with PCOS, the associations between time to regularity and irregular cycles were attenuated (unadjusted POR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.79-2.45) but some remained positive.   Table 2.

Irregular Cycles and Cardiometabolic Conditions  Figure 1 C and D show the covariate-adjusted associations between irregular cycles and the prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions (full estimates are shown in eTable 4 in Supplement 1 ). Among the 25\u2009115 participants who responded to this survey question, irregular cycles were associated with a higher prevalence of obesity (POR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.29-1.47), prediabetes (POR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.60-1.98), type 2 diabetes (POR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.15-1.64), high cholesterol (POR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.41), hypertension (POR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), metabolic syndrome (POR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.49-2.01), arrythmia (POR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41), heart attack (POR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.11-2.85), and TIA (POR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.09-2.11). These positive associations remained among participants without PCOS (type 2 diabetes: POR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.08-1.69]; high cholesterol: POR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05-1.30]; arrhythmia: POR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.43]; TIA: POR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.06-2.26]).    Exploratory Effect Modification Analyses  Estimates of RERIs for effect modification by BMI and physical activity are presented in eTables 5 to 8 in Supplement 1 , and results with a significant effect modification by either factor are illustrated in Figure 2 . There were positive effect modifications by BMI (high vs low) and physical activity (low vs high) for the associations between PCOS and several metabolic conditions ( Figure 2 A). Additionally, excess risk of arrythmia (RERI, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.08-0.80), stroke (RERI, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.11-2.88), and DVT (RERI, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.15-1.86) were introduced by gravidity (\u22652 vs 0). Similar effect modifications by BMI were found for the associations between irregular cycles and certain cardiometabolic conditions among participants without PCOS ( Figure 2 B).   Figure 2.   Exploratory Analyses of Effect Modification by Body Mass Index (BMI) and Physical Activity  Only results with significant effect modifications by either BMI (as measured by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) or physical activity are shown. Evaluation of effect modification by BMI is not applicable for the outcome of obesity. The full estimates for all conditions are shown in eTables 5 to 8 in Supplement 1 . The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) indicates the difference between the joint risk ratio and the separate contributions by the exposure and modifier (0, no interaction or exact additivity; >0, positive interaction or more than additivity; <0, negative interaction or less than additivity); the RERI can range to infinity in either direction. The 95% CIs for RERI were calculated based on the delta method. PCOS indicates polycystic ovary syndrome.       Other Exploratory Analyses  Results from other exploratory and sensitivity analyses are shown in eTables 9 to 19 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1 . Within subsets of participants who provided age at diagnosis (eTable 9 in Supplement 1 ), the mean age at diagnosis for cardiometabolic conditions was 4 to 7 years younger among those with PCOS vs no PCOS or those with prolonged time to regularity vs regular cycles within 4 years. A higher but statistically nonsignificant prevalence was found between possible hypothalamic amenorrhea and arrhythmia (eTable 10 in Supplement 1 ). Other forms of modeling the time-to-regularity variable, or excluding 409 individuals with potentially misclassified or inaccurate time to regularity, yielded similar conclusions (eTables 11 and 12; eFigure 3 in Supplement 1 ). Using multiple imputations for missing data resulted in similar findings (eTables 13-15 in Supplement 1 ). Excluding individuals with possible PCOS based on reported irregularity and hirsutism led to similar conclusions to those previously presented (eTable 16 in Supplement 1 ). Adjusting for parity instead of gravidity had a minimal impact (eTables 17-19 in Supplement 1 ).     Discussion  In this cross-sectional study of a large US cohort, we examined associations among PCOS, irregular cycles, and multiple cardiometabolic conditions. Similar to previous studies, we found that PCOS was associated with a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions. Additionally, prolonged time to regularity since menarche or irregular cycles in adulthood was associated with a higher prevalence of certain cardiometabolic conditions, even among participants without PCOS. Some of these associations were potentiated by high BMI or low physical activity. Findings from exploratory analyses suggested a younger age at diagnosis of several cardiometabolic conditions among participants with PCOS or prolonged time to regularity.  While the positive associations between PCOS and cardiometabolic conditions are consistent with prior studies, 10 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 our findings add to the existing knowledge through the study of a larger population-based cohort with a variety of common or rare (eg, arrythmia, stroke) cardiometabolic conditions. Meta-analyses have reported an increased prevalence of obesity in individuals with PCOS, 39 although debate on temporality continues. 40 , 41 Studies have also reported a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes among patients with PCOS, 42 , 43 and current international PCOS guidelines recommend diabetes screening. 3 Previous studies reported a higher risk of dyslipidemia and hypertension with PCOS, mostly attributable to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism through lipid metabolism and renin-angiotensin mechanisms. 44 , 45 , 46 In addition to higher prevalence, our preliminary finding of younger mean age at diagnosis of several metabolic conditions among individuals with PCOS suggests potential earlier onset of metabolic sequelae that may lead to shortening of health and/or life span, warranting future research. For cardiovascular conditions, we found associations between PCOS and higher prevalence of CAD, arrythmia, heart attack, stroke, TIA, DVT, and pulmonary embolism. Existing studies on PCOS and CVD were mostly retrospective or cross-sectional, conducted in small populations or hospital-based populations, and documented mixed findings. 9 , 10 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 Further population-based studies followed throughout the life course are needed to provide better insights for causal interpretations.  Existing large cohort studies on cardiac outcomes and other studies of associations between irregular cycles and increased CVD and CVD mortality included limited data on PCOS ascertainment or irregular cycles during adolescence 47 ; therefore, the findings were unable to show whether the observed associations might be explained by underlying PCOS or other etiology or how these conditions may be identified as early as possible. Our study fills in those gaps in several ways. First, we evaluated irregular cycles and cardiometabolic conditions among individuals with and without diagnosed PCOS. We found that having irregular cycles was associated with an elevated prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions, even among participants without PCOS. Second, we observed an elevated prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions among participants with a longer time from menarche to cycle regularity, an early-life marker of menstrual health that has rarely been evaluated in past studies. Third, the findings of our exploratory analyses suggest that individuals with prolonged time to regularity may be younger at diagnosis of several metabolic conditions as well as arrythmia and DVT, posing long-term health consequences. Regular menstruation (and maturation of the reproductive axis) are typically established within 1 to 2 years after menarche, 3 , 48 , 49 but evidence remains limited on whether irregularity beyond 2 years is harmful. 50 Prolonged time to regularity and adulthood irregular cycles may both be vital signs that could serve as markers of metabolic abnormalities, predisposing one to increased CVD prevalence or earlier onset. While future studies are needed to explore the precise time frame, our findings suggest a potentially important time window for early intervention and subsequent cardiometabolic health outcomes.  We also found effect modification by BMI and physical activity for the associations between PCOS or irregular cycles and certain cardiometabolic conditions, which has rarely been reported in population-based studies. While future studies with longitudinal data are warranted, our findings suggest the benefit of early intervention, such as weight management and exercise, that may help to alleviate cardiometabolic conditions among individuals with PCOS and/or irregular cycles. Furthermore, we found that hypothalamic amenorrhea, another etiology of irregular cycles, 33 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 may contribute to a higher prevalence of arrhythmia, which may be explained by low estrogen levels and stress. 33 , 56 , 57 Abnormal menstrual patterns may be indicative of a proinflammatory process 58 that may result in elevated CVD risk. In summary, irregular cycles may serve as an early vital sign to initiate earlier screening, counseling, and lifestyle interventions for cardiometabolic conditions.   Strengths and Limitations  This study has several strengths. First, a sample size of 60\u2009789 participants allowed for sufficient statistical power to detect even modest associations, including with some less common cardiometabolic conditions. Second, we collected time-to-regularity data as an early-life marker of menstrual health, which could prompt interventions to reduce future cardiometabolic risk. Third, our study was among the first to account for PCOS status when evaluating associations between irregular cycles and cardiometabolic conditions, which could better distinguish the potential pathophysiology of the observed associations. Fourth, we explored preliminary differences in age at diagnosis of cardiometabolic conditions by PCOS status and time to regularity, which may inform future research on early intervention and quality of life over the life course. Finally, the AWHS includes a diverse population by demographics; thus, our findings may be more generalizable than previous studies that evaluated PCOS, irregular cycles, and cardiometabolic conditions.  Our study also has several limitations. First, in this cross-sectional evaluation, all data were self-reported at baseline, so potential misclassification and reverse causation may be present. The cross-sectional design also limited our ability to account for lifetime hormone use in a more refined way that takes into account temporality. Future longitudinal evaluations with incident cases are needed to better understand causal effects and differentiate between increased lifetime risk vs earlier onset so that appropriate interventions over the life course can be explored. Second, the group without PCOS may include unreported and undiagnosed individuals given the complexity of a clinical PCOS diagnosis, 59 which may lead to biased estimates. However, some of the associations remained after excluding individuals with possible PCOS based on reported irregular cycles and hirsutism. Third, the survey response of troubled by unpredictable periods to define irregular menstrual cycles is a subjective measure of irregular cycles, but this proxy measure may lead to early self-identification and screening among the general population regardless of health literacy level or access to health care or menstrual tracking technologies. Fourth, unmeasured confounding may exist. Fifth, we were unable to generate commonly used composite CVD end points because we did not have data on cardiovascular death or hospitalization, 60 and our definition for metabolic syndrome was modified based on data availability. Additionally, multiple comparisons might increase the type I error rate. However, there is no uniform agreement on whether or when multiple testing adjustments are warranted. 61 , 62 , 63 Our analysis of PCOS showed large effect sizes and statistical significance, and our analysis on irregular cycles among participants without PCOS are novel and hypothesis generating by nature. Finally, given the criteria and self-selection for enrollment, our findings may not be generalizable to all US individuals or to other populations.     Conclusions  In this cross-sectional study of a large US cohort, we found positive associations between PCOS and cardiometabolic conditions and identified associations between longer time from menarche to cycle regularity or adulthood irregular cycles and certain cardiometabolic conditions, even among individuals without diagnosed PCOS. Some of these associations were modified by BMI and physical activity. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals with PCOS or prolonged time to regularity may be younger at diagnosis of several cardiometabolic conditions. While further validation is needed, there may be potential benefits to earlier screening and intervention among individuals with irregular cycles, regardless of PCOS diagnosis.",
