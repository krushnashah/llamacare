    "abstract": "Among multiple factors that affect the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diet has\nan important contribution. Chronic oxidative stress has also been implicated in the development of PCOS. The\npresent study is an attempt to evaluate dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and its relationship with odds of\nPCOS in Iran. The study was carried out as a case-control study in hospital outpatient clinics, Tehran,\nIran. Totally, 310 female participants with a history of PCOS and 602 age-matched controls took part in this\nstudy between June 2015 and December 2018. A reproducible and valid 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency\ninventory was utilized to determine the entire antioxidants of the usual diet in order to calculate dietary\nTAC. The relationship of dietary TAC with odds of PCOS were assessed adjusting for potential confounders\nthrough an estimation of two multivariable conditional regression models. The first tertile was presented as a\nreference category. In a fully adjusted model, the highest tertile of dietary TAC was associated with a reduced odds of\nPCOS [odds ratio (OR): 0.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.59, 0.96, P for trend: 0.038). In addition,\nPCOS odds decreased in the highest tertile of \u03b1-tocopherol intake (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.88, P for trend:\n0.023). The adjusted ORs in the highest tertile of vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene and magnesium were 0.79 (95% CI:\n0.83-0.97), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.67-0.98) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.55-0.9 8) respectively, with a significant trend. Our results provide evidence that there was a relationship between high TAC diets and lower odds of\nPCOS.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common\ngynecological endocrinopathy that affects 8-13% of\nwomen in the reproductive age ( 1 ). Although, the cause\nof PCOS is still not fully understood, there are several\npossibilities. Main of them included: i. Hypothalamic/\npituitary dysregulation contributes to a rise in the ovarian\nandrogen production and ii. Hyperandrogenism leads to\ninsulin resistance that results to PCOS ( 2 ). Due to insulin\nresistance, hyperinsulinemia happens and speeds up the\novarian androgen production, which can lead to the PCOS\noccurrence ( 3 , 4 ). Recent studies have demonstrated that\noxidative stress contributes to the development of PCOS,\ninfertility and hyperandrogenism ( 5 , 6 ). Important factors that increase the oxidative stress in PCOS are insulin\nresistance and hyperglycemia ( 7 ).  Oxidative stress is clarified as a lack of balance\namong oxidants and antioxidants in the alive biological\nsystems ( 8 ). The oxidative stress decrease is positively\nrelated to further matured oocytes in the infertile\nPCOS women ( 9 ). Oxidative stress causes widespread\natherosclerosis lesions in the ovarian arteries ( 10 , 11 ).\nThus, the use of anti-oxidative agents has become an\nincreasingly popular method in the PCOS management\n( 12 ). Research works have shown that there is a\nrelationship between PCOS and dietary intakes ( 13 - 15 ).\nThe dietary antioxidants with a negative relationship\nwith PCOS are vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc and beta-carotene ( 13 ). A recent study showed that\nplant-based dietary pattern is associated with lower\nodds ratio (OR) of PCOS and antioxidant-rich foods\nmay protect the body against oxidative damage in\nthese patients ( 14 ). Furthermore, adherence to an\nantioxidants-rich diet may be inversely associated with\nPCOS ( 15 ). There are emerging evidences that total\nantioxidant capacity (TAC) of dietary can be used as\na measurement index that covers combined actions\nof dietary total antioxidants. This assay gives better\npredictions of dietary intake relation with chronic\ndiseases ( 16 ). Studies demonstrate that higher dietary\nTAC is associated with lower weight and abdominal fat\ngain ( 17 ). Furthermore, higher dietary TAC is related\nto greater improvement in the heart disease risk factors\nand reduced risk of pancreatic cancer ( 18 , 19 ).  Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data, especially\non dietary TAC and PCOS relationship. Thus, this\nfinding encouraged us to design a case-control study to\nexamine the relationship of dietary TAC and the odds\nof PCOS.    Materials and Methods   Study design and population  All volunteers signed informed consent before the onset\nof the study. The Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti\nUniversity of Medical Sciences approved the study (IR.\nSBMU.RETECH.REC.1398.750). The whole procedure\nwas conducted as per the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as\nrevised in 2013 and the ethical standards of the responsible\ncommittee on human experimentation.  A total of 310 patients with a PCOS history between\nthe ages of 20-35 years and 602 age-matched healthy\nvolunteers participated in this case-control study.\nThis study was performed in the various hospital\nendocrinology clinics of Tehran, Iran. Our case group\ninclusion criteria comprised women with a diagnosis\nor a history of PCOS. Based on the international\nRotterdam Criteria 2003, PCOS patients diagnosed\nin the past three months had to have two out of three\nsymptoms at least ( 20 ). They were diagnosed, follow\nof clinical or biochemical signs of hyper-androgenism,\noligo-ovulation or anovulation and polycystic ovaries\nby ultrasonography. Also, control group was invited\nfrom age-matched referred patients to other clinics\nsuch as orthopedic, ear, nose, throat clinics or elective\nsurgeries were referred to the same clinics that were\nnot suffered of ongoing or previous PCOS. They had\nregular menstrual cycles (26-33 day cycles) without any\novulatory abnormalities, polycystic ovary and hyperandrogenism. The rest of the inclusion criteria for the\ncontrol group were similar to the case group. On the\nthird day of their menstrual cycle, endocrine hormones\nserum level and full pelvic ultrasound assessment were\nperformed. All participants, cases and controls, were\nfree of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, renal\ndisease and did not follow special diets.    Socio-demographic assessment  Age, smoking, first menarche age, literacy level,\nhistory of medication, supplementation and monthly\nfamily income were recorded from the pretested\nbaseline questionnaire. Due to participants\u2019 religious\nand cultural taboos, questions regarding alcohol and\nopium were omitted ( 21 ). Details of anthropometric\nand physical activity assessments have been reported\npreviously ( 22 ).    Dietary assessment  The dietary data were collected through a valid\nsemi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)\n( 23 ). All participants were asked about their usual\nintakes over the past year, although in the case group\nwe considered a last year before PCOS diagnosis.\nNutrient Data Laboratory of United States Department\nof Agriculture (USDA) database was used to calculate\ndietary TAC for selected foods by the oxygen radical\nabsorbance capacity method. Results were expressed as\nmmol of Trolox Equivalents (mmol TE/day) ( 24 ). Using\nresidual method, dietary TAC was adjusted for total\nenergy intake.    Statistical analysis  Data analysis was done in statistical package for\nthe social sciences software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA, version 20) (P<0.05). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,\nhistogram and Q-Q plot were used for normality of\ncontinuous variables. Dietary intake variables were not\nnormally distributed. Therefore, transformations such as\nlogarithm, square root, reciprocal, cube root, and square\nwere done using parametric tests. Analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA) adjusting for total energy was used to\nexamine significant differences in antioxidant intakes.\nOR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated\nby binary conditional logistic regression models to\ninvestigate the association of odds PCOS in each tertile\ndietary antioxidant variables. A tertile cut-off point was\nused to categorize dietary TAC, Vitamin C, \u03b1-tocopherol,\nzinc, \u03b2-carotene, lycopene selenium and magnesium were\ndivided into the tertiles. The first tertile was presented\nas a reference category. The following variables were\nadjusted; body mass index (BMI), sex, age, physical\nactivity, familiar history of PCOS, smoking and total\nenergy intake.     Results  Final analysis was conducted on 303 PCOS cases\n(97.7% participation rate) and 588 controls (97.7%).\nTwenty-one participants were initially excluded given the\nlog scales of total energy intake, which were either >3 or\n<3 standard deviation (SD) from the mean.  The mean \u00b1 SD for age was 29.1 \u00b1 5.9 and 28.8 \u00b1\n6.2 in cases and controls represents the age-matched\ndesign. In comparison to the controls, BMI (33.7 \u00b1 6.1 vs. 24.2 \u00b1 4.9) and waist circumference (WC) (97.2 \u00b1\n8.2 vs. 80.1 \u00b1 6.5) of the case group were higher along\nwith the incidence of PCOS in their families (P<0.05).\nMean metabolic equivalent (MET) (47.3 \u00b1 5.9 hour/day\nvs. 58.1 \u00b1 7.1 hour/day) and dietary fiber intake (13 \u00b1\n3.9 vs. 16 \u00b1 4.1) were significantly lower in cases. In\naddition, the mean energy intake (3009 \u00b1 709 vs. 2139 \u00b1\n605) in the cases was significantly higher in comparison\nwith controls (P<0.05).  Table 1 lists the mean intakes of dietary antioxidant\nvariables, both for cases and controls. Cases had lower\ndietary TAC, \u03b1-tocopherol, vitamin C and magnesium\n(P<0.005). No differences were found between cases\nand the control group as regards lycopene, zinc, and\nselenium.

Associations of dietary antioxidant variables with odds\nof PCOS are shown in Table 2. There was a significant\nrelationship between the dietary TAC with an odds ratio\n(OR) of PCOS in the base model (OR of the highest\ntertile compared to lowest one: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.49-0.91).\nAfter adjusting for BMI, WC, energy intake, dietary\nintake of fiber, familial history of PCOS and physical\nactivity, the highest tertile of the dietary TAC score was\nassociated with a reduced odds ratio of PCOS (OR:\n0.81, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96). There was a significant linear\ndecrease among the dietary TAC tertiles for the odds\nratio of PCOS (P trend=0.038). There was an inverse\nrelationship between the dietary intake of \u03b1-tocopherol\nand the odds of PCOS in both base and fully adjusted\nmodels. The multivariable OR (95% CI) for PCOS was\n0.73 (0.56-0.88) in the highest tertiles of \u03b1-tocopherol,\ncompared to the lowest tertile. The adjusted ORs in the\nhighest tertile of vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene and magnesium\nwere 0.79 (95% CI: 0.83-0.97), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.67-\n0.98) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.55-0.98) respectively, with a\nsignificant trend.

Discussion  To be best of our knowledge, the association of dietary\nTAC with PCOS was assessed for the first time in a developing country in the present study. Higher intake\nof dietary TAC, \u03b1-tocopherol, vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene\nand magnesium were inversely associated with lower\nodds of PCOS, even after adjusting for confounding\nfactors. Intake of the \u03b1-tocopherol, vitamin C and\n\u03b2-carotene were significantly associated with reducing\nthe odds of PCOS. Our data are consistent with\nShahrokhi and Naeini ( 13 ) study that demonstrated\nrelationship between the higher intakes of vitamin\nC, vitamin E, and \u03b2-carotene and the reduced odds\nof PCOS. Barrea et al. ( 25 ) reported a relationship\nbetween the Mediterranean diet (rich in antioxidants)\nand decreased odds of PCOS that consistent with\nour findings these data show a relationship between\na diet high in the TAC and decreased odds of PCOS.\nSimilarly with the current study, we previously found\na significant negative association between adherence\nto the antioxidant nutrient pattern and odds of PCOS\n( 15 ). Furthermore, clinical trials demonstrated the\nbeneficial effects of dietary antioxidants on the PCOS\nmanagement ( 26 ). It was interesting that, Shahrokhi and\nNaeini ( 13 ) and present study are contradictory about\nthe relationship of the zinc and selenium intakes with\nPCOS. In the present study, we found no significant\nassociation between zinc and selenium with the odds\nof PCOS, while Shahrokhi and Naeini ( 13 ) showed\ndietary selenium and zinc were inversely associated\nwith PCOS at a significant level.  As to the important role of diet in the chronic\ndiseases, examine the general dietary antioxidant\nintake seems essential, particularly, the different\nantioxidants proportion of diet in combination with\nsynergistic effects that prevent diseases via several\nmechanisms. Dietary TAC considers the synergistic\ninteractions of antioxidant nutrients and can be used\nto assess the relationship between dietary intake\nand several chronic disorders. Verit et al. ( 27 ) found\nthat TAC was the most important prediction element\nto PCOS. Kanafchian et al. ( 28 ) concluded TAC is\ndecreased in the PCOS patients, which may be due\nto increased oxidative stress. Enechukwu et al. ( 29 )\nshowed that decreased TAC correlates with the cause\nof PCOS in these patients. However, Ghowsi et al. ( 30 )\nand Shahrokhi and Naeini ( 13 ) found that there were\nnot any significant differences in the serum TAC in the\nPCOS patients and the healthy control group.  An imbalance between the antioxidant and free radical\nproduction in the ovaries can cause negative effects\non the oocyte quality, productivity, development, and\ngrowth of the placenta ( 31 , 32 ). Lowered oxidative\nstress is related to better prognosis of PCOS ( 33 ).\nPCOS can lead to a decrease in the quality of life,\nespecially if it is accompanied by chronic diseases\nlike type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia,\nhypertension, heart disease in which oxidative stress\nmay intensify complications of these diseases ( 34 ).\nAntioxidants have a relationship with apoptosis in the\novarian tissue via different mechanisms. These are\nconnected with proper growth and action of interstitial\ncells ( 35 ). Antioxidants, which impede or restrict, the\nharmful results of oxygen radicals have a vital role in\nthe reproductive system functional and fertility process\nin the female ( 36 ). The dietary approaches to stop\nhypertension (DASH) diet is featured with using of\nthe high amount of fruit, vegetables and legumes ( 37 ).\nA review study showed that the DASH diet and lower\nlevels of oxidative stress biomarkers are related to each\nother ( 38 ). Obese women with the DASH eating plan\nare at the risk of the improvement of insulin resistance\nand inflammatory factors ( 37 ). Also, a dietary trigger\nlike glucose can induce oxidative stress and cause\nan inflammatory response even without excess of\nadiposity in the PCOS patients. Based on a previous\nstudy, Mediterranean-inspired low glycemic load\nanti-inflammatory diet can improve hormones, body\ncomposition, and menstrual cyclicity, metabolic status,\nand inflammatory factors ( 39 ).  Our study has several limitations. Although, the\nvalidity and reproducibility of FFQ among Iranians\nhas been well supported, our data may suffer from\nmeasurement error. However, we excluded participants\nthat under/over reported their energy intakes. The\nnature of case-control design with its inherent biases\nwould not allow establishing causation. Since cases\nwere chosen out of a newly-diagnosed PCOS patients,\nthere is less concern about recall bias. Since control\ngroup were recruited from the same hospital, similar\nsocioeconomic status, a great element in the developing\ncountries that influence nutritional status/intake can be\ngreatly controlled. In order to control selection bias, we\nselected our control group of the same clinical center\nbecause their participation rate were higher. Residual\nconfounding may not be completely ruled out because of\nimprecise measurements of covariates. However, there\nis a small risk that measurement errors in confounders\nwere extreme since the crude and multivariable results\nwere basically similar. Moreover, studies have reported\nthat clinic PCOS patients tend to be more overweight\nthan community PCOS patients, which can significantly\naffect the severity of PCOS ( 40 ). Similarly, the women\nin our study were more severely affected. We did not\nmatch cases and controls for BMI due to overmatching\nas it could narrow the exposure range.  One of the strengths present study was the high\nparticipation rate. When dietary information is obtained\nat onset of disease, it may not always reflect a typical\neating pattern, thus cases may have altered their diet\naccording to their disease symptoms. Therefore, to\nreduce the possibility of changing the habitual dietary\nintake, cases were included in the study 3 months prior\nto the interview. Controls were also free of any major\nrisk factors for PCOS. Another strength was the use of\nFFQ along with a detailed assessment with adjustment\nfor potential confounders. Compared to a single 24-h\ndietary recall, the FFQ allowed us to collect rarely\nconsumed food items as well as seasonal variations.    Conclusion  Our results indicated that a high TAC diet plays a role\nin lowering the odds ratio of developing PCOS, although\nlarge prospective studies are needed to expand on these\nfindings.",
