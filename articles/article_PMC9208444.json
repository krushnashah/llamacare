    "body": "Highlights   A hyperandrogenic PCOS mouse model was established to explore the changes in Hcy and autophagy in ovarian tissues to elucidate the possible mechanism for the modulation of GC autophagy by Hcy. HA induces an increase in the Hcy level in PCOS mice. Androgen increases the Hcy concentration in mGCs, and then DHT and Hcy promote autophagy.     Introduction  Data from the National Institutes of Health indicate that 15\u201320% of women of reproductive age suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is the main cause of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities [ 1 ]. The primary pathological characteristics of PCOS include hyperandrogenism [ 2 ].  Homocysteine (Hcy) occurs in high levels in the serum of patients with PCOS. Hcy is an essential amino acid and is important for the growth of cells. Under physiological conditions, Hcy is methylated by methionine synthase (MTR) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) to form methionine, and this process occurs predominantly in the liver [ 3 ]. The cause and effect of hyperhomocysteinemia in PCOS patients still have not been fully elucidated. Clinical studies report that excessive androgen intake is highly correlated with increased Hcy concentrations [ 4\u20136 ]. A previous study reported that patients suffering from hyperhomocysteinemia who underwent folic acid treatment did not exhibit a decrease in Hcy and its metabolic products in their cells [ 7 ]. Hcy can be metabolized in two ways, the transsulfuration pathway, or the remethylation pathway. One is the methylation provided by the activation of Hcy and folic acid to synthesize methionine, and the activity of homocysteine metabolizing enzymes is normal. Supplementation of folic acid can reduce the concentration of Hcy [ 3 ]. These findings indicate that the metabolic processes of Hcy are modulated by complex mechanisms.  Previous studies reported increased autophagy in the ovarian tissues of patients with PCOS [ 8 ], but only a few studies have explored the factors leading to this increase. Autophagic imbalance is associated with the dysregulation of follicular granulosa cell (GC) death and atresia in PCOS. Light chain 3 (LC3), autophagy-specific substrate P62, and Beclin1 are widely used for monitoring the autophagy process. LC3 has two isoforms, the cytosolic form (LC3I) and the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3II). The autophagosomal marker, LC3II, is used to determine autophagic activity [ 9 ]. Beclin1 plays a role in the initiation of autophagy [ 10 ]  Abnormal levels of Hcy modulate autophagy in multiple tissues [ 11 , 12 ]. However, studies have not fully explored whether Hcy activates or inhibits autophagy in ovarian tissue.  In the present study, a hyperandrogenic PCOS mouse model was established to explore the changes in Hcy and autophagy in ovarian tissues to elucidate the possible mechanism for the modulation of GC autophagy by Hcy. The findings of the study show that Hcy promotes autophagy in GCs by modulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in PCOS both in vitro and in vivo.    Materials and methods   Animals  This study was approved by the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital Experimental Animals Welfare and Ethics Committee and followed the guidelines of the Experimental Animals Management Committee (Jiangsu Province, China). Three-week-old female ICR mice and eight-week-old ICR mice, including 12 females and 6 males, were purchased from the Animal Experimental Center of the Nanjing Medical University (China). The eight-week-old mice were bred for further experiments, and the three-week-old mice were used for the GC culture. The mice were housed in individual ventilated cages with a light/dark cycle of 12\u00a0h at 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C. The first day of the copulatory plug check was considered gestation. Pregnant mice at 16.5\u201318.5\u00a0days gestation were injected with 350\u00a0\u03bcg of DHT (20,649, MCE, China) that had been dissolved in 50\u00a0\u00b5l of sesame oil. The offspring were born, and the female offspring were fed for 8\u20139\u00a0weeks. The normal estrous cycle was divided into four stages [ 13 ]: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Vaginal smears were observed daily for 10\u00a0days when the PCOS and control mice reached seven weeks old. Mice that exhibited two consecutive normal four-day estrous cycles were used in the control group. The body weight and anogenital distance of the mice were measured, ovaries were collected, and blood was harvested. All animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital.    Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test  Glucose tolerance was measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). The mice were fasted overnight and injected intraperitoneally with glucose at 1.5\u00a0g/kg. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at 0, 30, 60,90, and 120\u00a0min after injection and tested for glucose. The plasma glucose of every animal was measured using the glucometer (YUWELL; Shanghai, China). The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated for glucose.    Hematoxylin and eosin staining and the quantification of follicles  The ovaries were cut into sections with a thickness of 5\u00a0\u03bcm, and every fifth section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The follicles containing an oocyte nucleus were counted. The primordial, primary, secondary, and antral follicles were described in a previous report [ 14 ].The total number of follicles in each group was then multiplied by five.    Homocysteine measurements in serum, ovary homogenate, and cultured supernatants  Blood was collected from the posterior orbital venous plexus, refrigerated overnight at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Phosphate buffered saline(PBS,1\u00a0ml) was added to the ovarian tissue, and a tissue crusher was used for tissue homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant samples were transferred to new separate tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The serum, ovary homogenate (assayed at a 1:50-fold dilution), and culture medium levels of Hcy were detected using an ELISA kit (Cusabio Technology LLC, Wuhan, China).    Immunohistochemistry  The expression of MTR, BHMT, LC3B, and P62 in the ovaries was detected using IHC. The sections were baked at 65\u00b0C in an oven, dehydrated with alcohol, incubated with 3% H 2 O 2 , boiled in 10\u00a0mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) three times, added to solution A (for biotin block), and washed three more times in TBS. Sections were incubated in goat serum for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, and were then incubated separately with anti-MTR (1:200, ab66039, Abcam, UK), anti-BHMT (1:200, ab243698, Abcam, UK), anti-LC3B (1:300, ab48394, Abcam, UK), and anti-P62 (1:200, F032602, Abways Technology) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Samples were then washed in PBS. Sections were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, and the sections were then stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin at room temperature. The negative control sections were incubated in biotinylated goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (1:200 dilution) and stained with the experimental sections. Densitometric quantification was performed using ImageJ software.    Primary granulosa cell culture  The three-week-old mice were used for the GC culture. Ovaries were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone laboratories, USA), 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate, 2\u2009mM glutamine, 100\u2009IU/ml penicillin, and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin from three-week-old ICR mice following a method described previously [ 15 ]. Syringe needles (1 mL) were used to puncture the ovaries, and the oocytes were then filtered using a 40\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer. GCs were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . In some groups mGCs were cultured in a medium containing Hcy (Sigma, USA), DHT (20,649, MCE, China), CQ (Sigma, USA), mTOR activator (MHY1485), apalutamide (ARN509), or BHMT plasmid for 24 or 48\u00a0h.    Western blot analysis  Lysates from ovarian tissue and mGCs were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with MTR antibody (1:2000, ab66039, Abcam, UK), BHMT antibody (1:200, ab243698, Abcam, UK), LC3B antibody (1:1000, ab48394, Abcam, UK), P62 antibody (1:1000, F032602, Abways Technology), Beclin-1 antibody (D40C5, 1:500, 3495s, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), mTOR (s2442) antibody (1:1000, BS3611, bioWORLD), and p-mTOR antibody (1:1000, BS4706, bioWORLD). In addition, samples were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Inc.) was used for visualization. Protein levels were quantified and normalized using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:10,000, AB0037, Abways Technology) as internal control.    Transmission electron microscopy  After being fixed, dehydrated, and embedded according to standard procedures, cells were observed under an HT7700 electron microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Chiyoda, Japan).     Statistical analysis  Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 8, and values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Student\u2019s t-tests were used for comparisons between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison tests were used for comparisons between more than two groups. Statistical significance was defined as p <\u00a00.05.    Results   High concentration of homocysteine is observed in the serum and ovarian tissue of polycystic ovary syndrome mice  Several animal models have been used to study PCOS [ 16 , 17 ]. A prenatally androgenized PCOS mouse model was established in the current study. Analysis showed that the PCOS model exhibited hyperandrogenism, implying that the model was constructed successfully ( see Supplemental Data 1 ). To explore the level of Hcy in PCOS mice with hyperandrogenism, Hcy levels were determined in the serum and ovarian tissues using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When comparing the PCOS mice with the control group, the Hcy levels in the serum (7.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99 and. 4.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, respectively) and ovarian tissue (6980\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0722.4 vs. 3300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0341.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, respectively) were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group ( see  Figure 1a \u2013b). To further explore the role of MTR and BHMT in Hcy metabolism in PCOS mice, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed, and the findings showed that MTR and BHMT were highly expressed in GCs, but theca cells or stroma showed low expression levels. In addition, MTR and BHMT were mainly localized in the cytoplasm and only low levels were observed in the nucleus. The expression levels of MTR and BHMT were lower in the PCOS mice than in the control group ( see  Figure 1c ). These findings indicate that increased Hcy levels may be associated with hyperandrogenism. Figure 1.

Ovarian tissue of polycystic ovary syndrome mice exhibits high autophagic activity  Previous studies have shown that Hcy is implicated in the regulation of autophagy [ 18\u201321 ]. The expression levels of autophagy-related markers were determined to explore the level of autophagy in the ovarian tissues of PCOS mice. IHC results showed that LC3B and P62 were mainly expressed in GCs in the ovarian tissues (see  Figure 2a ). The findings showed an upregulation in the expression of LC3II and Beclin1 and a downregulation of the autophagy substrate P62 in the ovarian tissue of the PCOS mice (see  Figure 2b ). These findings indicate that high levels of Hcy may activate autophagy in the ovarian tissues of PCOS mice. Figure 2. Autophagy level in the ovarian tissues of polycystic ovary syndrome mice .

(b) Expression levels of Beclin 1, light chain 3-II, and P62 proteins in the ovarian tissues of polycystic ovary syndrome mice and control mice as determined by western blot analysis. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD.      High levels of homocysteine promote the activation of autophagy in mouse granulosa cells  The analysis showed a high concentration of Hcy in the ovarian tissue of PCOS mice and a downregulation the key enzymes, MTR and BHMT, in the GCs. To further explore whether increased levels of Hcy modulate autophagic activity in mouse granulosa cells (mGCs), mGCs were treated with different concentrations of Hcy (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) for 24\u00a0h. Treatment with 200 and 400\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of Hcy significantly increased the levels of LC3II ( see  Figure 3a ). mGCs were then treated with 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/L Hcy for various durations (0, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h). The findings showed that the expression of LC3II was significantly upregulated in mGCs treated with 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/L Hcy for 12 and 24\u00a0h ( see  Figure 3b ). Therefore, this dose was selected for subsequent experiments. To further explore the level of autophagy after treatment with Hcy, mGCs were treated with different concentrations (0, 25, 50, or 100\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) for 2\u00a0h. The analysis showed that the expression of LC3II was significantly increased in mGCs after treatment with 100\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of CQ for 2\u00a0h ( see Supplemental Data 2A ). Therefore, this concentration was utilized for further assays. CQ inhibits the fusion process of autophagosomes and lysosomes, thus autophagy cannot be completed, resulting in the accumulation of LC3II. After treatment with CQ for 2\u00a0h, the cells were cultured with CQ and Hcy for another 24\u00a0h. The results showed that the level of LC3II in mGCs treated with CQ and Hcy was higher than in those treated with CQ alone. This further suggests that Hcy still initiates autophagy when the fusion process of autophagosomes and lysosomes is inhibited ( see  Figure 3c ). Transmission electron microscopy showed that the number of autophagosomes increased significantly after treatment with Hcy in mGCs ( see  Figure 3d ). These findings indicate that Hcy induces autophagy in mGCs. Figure 3. Homocysteine promotes the activation of autophagy in mouse granulosa cells .

Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0nm. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, and experiments were repeated at least three times.      Homocysteine induces autophagy by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway in mouse granulosa cells  mTOR could participated in the induction, processing, and termination of autophagy [ 22 ]. The expression levels of phosphorylated-mTOR (p-mTOR) and mTOR in the ovarian tissues of the PCOS mice and the control group were evaluated to explore whether the mTOR signaling pathway is involved in autophagy. When compared with the control group, p-mTOR expression was significantly lower in the ovaries of the PCOS mice ( see  Figure 4a ). However, the analysis showed no significant difference in mTOR expression between the PCOS mice and the control group. In vitro cell experiments were performed to further verify the findings. mGCs were treated with mTOR activator MHY1485 (0, 5, 10, or 20\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; see Supplemental Data 3A ) and/or 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of Hcy ( see  Figure 4b ). MHY1485 is an mTOR activator that inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes by upregulating the expression of p-mTOR. However, it does not change the total mTOR levels [ 23 ]. The findings showed that Hcy did not affect mTOR expression, but it significantly inhibited p-mTOR expression in Hcy-treated mGCs when compared with the control group ( see  Figure 4b ). The analysis showed that the high LC3II expression in the mGCs was abrogated after cotreatment with 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of Hcy and 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of MHY1485. These findings further indicate that Hcy partly induces autophagy by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway in mGCs. Figure 4.

The quantitative puncta analysis is presented on the right panel. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, and experiments were repeated at least three times.      Dihydrotestosterone activated autophagy in mouse granulosa cells and downregulated methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase  Hyperandrogenemia (HA) is the main characteristic of PCOS mice and can affect other metabolic processes. mGCs were treated with different concentrations of DHT (0, 0.5, 1, and 2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) for 24 or 48\u00a0h to further explore the relationship between HA and increased Hcy levels. The analysis showed no significant differences in LC3II expression between mGCs treated with DHT for 24\u00a0h and untreated cells ( see Supplemental Data 4A ). ELISA results showed that the treatment of mGCs with 1\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of DHT for 48\u00a0h significantly increased Hcy levels ( see  Figure 5a ). The analysis showed that the expression of LC3II was significantly upregulated in mGCs treated with 1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L of DHT for 48\u00a0h ( see  Figure 5b ). Therefore, this concentration was used for further experiments. In addition, the expression of MTR and BHMT was significantly downregulated in a concentration-dependent manner, as indicated by the western blot analysis ( see  Figure 5b ). Figure 5. Androgen inactivates the homocysteine metabolizing enzymes (methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase) and increases homocysteine levels in mouse granulosa cells .

The quantitative puncta analysis is presented on the lower panel, data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and experiments were repeated at least three times.      Blockage of androgen may reverse dihydrotestosterone-induced homocysteine and autophagic changes in mouse granulosa cells  For further analysis, 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L of the androgen receptor inhibitor ARN509 was used to block androgens in mGCs. ELISA results showed that ARN509 reversed the significant increase in Hcy levels in mGCs caused by DHT ( see  Figure 6a ). Notably, the level of expression of MTR and BHMT in mGCs was not affected after treatment with ARN509 and DHT ( see  Figure 6b ). In addition, no significant differences were observed in mTOR expression in mGCs treated with DHT or ARN509 ( see  Figure 6b ). DHT significantly upregulated LC3II and downregulated p-mTOR in mGCs ( see  Figure 6b ). The expression levels of p-mTOR and LC3II were not significantly altered after mGCs were treated with DHT and ARN509. These finding show that blocking androgen reverses DHT-induced Hcy and autophagic changes in mGCs. Figure 6.

The quantitative puncta analysis is presented on the right and lower panels, data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and experiments were repeated at least three times.      Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase overexpression reverses the dihydrotestosterone-induced increase in homocysteine and the activation of autophagy  mGCs were transfected with plasmids overexpressing BHMT to explore the effect of androgen on BHMT. The level of Hcy in the culture medium was not detectable ( see  Figure 7a ). Western blot analysis showed that BHMT expression was upregulated in mGCs ( see  Figure 7b ). Treatment of mGCs with DHT and transfection with BHMT plasmid resulted in no significant differences in the mTOR, p-mTOR, or LC3II levels ( see  Figure 7b ). The findings observed for BHMT-overexpressing cells were not consistent with the findings on the effects of DHT. These findings further indicated that androgens downregulate the expression of Hcy-metabolizing enzymes and increase Hcy levels in mGCs. DHT and Hcy promote autophagy in mGCs by modulating the mTOR signal pathway ( see  Figure 8 ). Figure 7.

Discussion  The findings of the current study showed that increased levels of Hcy in ovarian tissues activated autophagy partly through the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway in PCOS mice and treated mGCs. High Hcy concentrations can be attributed to decreased expression levels of BHMT and MTR in mGCs. The findings relating to the Hcy-induced modulation of autophagy in mGCs provides a new experimental basis for factors affecting ovulation in PCOS.  In the mice, the concentration of Hcy was several hundred times higher in the ovarian tissues than in the serum. Significant differences in Hcy concentration were observed between PCOS mice and the control group.These findings indicate that disorders in Hcy metabolism in GCs may be more severe than in serum. Our previous study reported that the expression levels of BHMT and MTR were decreased in the ovarian tissue of PCOS mice and the GCs of patients with PCOS [ 24 ]. In the current study, the relationship between androgen and changes in Hcy concentration in mGCs was explored. The findings showed that androgen increased Hcy concentrations by downregulating MTR and BHMT in mGCs in vitro. In vivo, high Hcy concentrations were correlated with high androgen levels in the ovarian GCs of patients with PCOS [ 25 ]. In addition, a disturbance in the Hcy metabolism in the GCs leads to increased Hcy concentration in the follicular fluid [ 26 ]. Follicular fluid originates both from the trans-exudate molecules of the blood and secretions from ovarian follicular cells [ 27 ].  A clinical correlation analysis indicated that excessive androgen is correlated with Hcy metabolism. The long-term (> 20 y) intake of excess synthesized androgen in males results in increased serum Hcy concentration, decreased sex hormone binding globulin, and an increased risk of thromboembolism [ 6 ], which is supported by findings obtained from experiments using Wistar mice. A six-week treatment with synthesized androgen (Nandrolone) caused an increase in the Hcy concentration and lipid peroxidation in the cardiac tissues [ 28 ]. These findings indicate that androgen significantly affects Hcy metabolism.  Autophagy is essential for maintaining the balance between cellular homeostasis and survival [ 29 ]. In physiological conditions, autophagy serves various functions, including equilibrating ovulation and follicular atresia, which is involved in follicular development. Abnormal activation of autophagy in the ovaries leads to follicular atresia and premature ovarian failure [ 30 ]. The findings of the current study showed that autophagy was activated in the ovarian tissues of PCOS mice and DHT-treated mGCs. Androgen-induced autophagy has previously been detected in the skeletal muscles of a PCOS mouse model [ 31 ] and in GCs derived from in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in patients with PCOS [ 11 ]. However, there are differences between the cells used in the current study and those used previously. The primary cultures of mGCs were stimulated in the study, which is different from the human GCs derived from IVF used in the previous study. mGCs can be used to further explore the biomolecular mechanisms of autophagy.  The findings show that Hcy mediates androgen-induced autophagy. Hcy modulates autophagy in various cells [ 11 , 12 , 32 ]. Hyperhomocysteinemia induces cellular oxidative stress and protein aggregation and dysfunction, promotes inflammation, and impairs autophagy [ 5 , 33 ]. Excess Hcy promotes the upregulation of the fission marker DRP-1, leading to mitochondrial remodeling. The dysregulation leads to the increased activation of autophagy and cell toxicity in mouse brain endothelial cells [ 32 ]. The findings of the current study show that Hcy promotes autophagosome accumulation in mGCs and decreases the degradation of cellular components, as shown by transmission electron microscopy analysis. These changes may lead to a disturbance in the functioning of GCs. Follicular growth and atresia are highly correlated with the status of GCs [ 34 ]. An increase in GC autophagy may lead to follicular atresia during the process of folliculogenesis [ 35 ]. Hcy induces the downregulation of the expression of the hairy and enhancer of split-1 and P62 in the cortical neurons of mice [ 36 ] and accumulation of LC3 and P62 in the astrocyte cells of humans and mice [ 37 ]. Hcy-induced autophagy in GCs may induce the ovulatory disturbances observed in PCOS. In addition, the changes observed can contribute to the poor quality of embryos and high miscarriage rate [ 38 , 39 ], which may be caused by Hcy-induced impaired autophagic flux.  Autophagy is a complicated process and mTOR is one of its most important regulators. mTOR represses nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB through phosphorylation, thus promoting the formation of lysosomes [ 40 ]. In addition, mTOR promotes anabolism and cellular growth. Starvation or other extreme stimulation represses the synthesis of mTOR and related proteins and activates autophagy to preserve energy [ 41 ]. The analysis in the current study shows that p-mTOR expression was significantly lower in the ovaries of PCOS mice when compared with the control group. In addition, differences in p-mTOR expression between individual mice were relatively large. Notably, some mice did not exhibit the expression of p-mTOR, probably because phosphorylation is a dynamic process [ 42 ], and it was challenging to determine an optimal time for the analysis of the chronic PCOS model. Therefore, p-mTOR expression was determined in mGCs treated with DHT or Hcy in vitro, and the results were consistent with the in vivo results. Autophagy was activated and p-mTOR was downregulated in Hcy- and DHT-treated mGCs in vitro. A decrease in mTOR signaling may play a negative role in follicular growth, which can lead to follicular atresia and the inhibition of meiosis in oocytes [ 43 ].  Currently, several different treatment interventions exist for ovulation disorders. Therapy to lower Hcy and androgen levels can help to reverse ovulation disorders. However, the efficacy of therapies targeting autophagy in GCs should be explored further. Systemic BHMT-expressing plasmid can be considered as a novel therapy for hyperhomocysteinemia.  However, the mechanism of the Hcy-induced disturbance of autophagy is complex and future studies should explore this mechanism in GCs. The findings of the current study show that an increase in Hcy modulated androgen-activated autophagy by suppressing the mTOR pathway in the GCs of PCOS mice.    Conclusion  The findings indicate that HA induces an increase in the Hcy level in PCOS mice. High Hcy levels modulate androgen-induced autophagy by suppressing the mTOR signaling pathway. These findings imply that the Hcy-induced modulation of autophagy may cause follicular stasis and ovulation disorders in PCOS.
