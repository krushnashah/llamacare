PCOS rat models were established by injection of dehydro\u2010isoandrosterone, followed by treatment of si\u2010HOTAIR, oe\u2010HOTAIR, miR\u2010130a mimics or miR\u2010130a inhibitors.

    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequently occurring endocrine disorder in women during reproductive age, which is associated with hyperinsulinaemia, hyperandrogenaemia and aberrant adipokines production from the adipose tissue. 1 PCOS is also a hormonal, metabolic and psychosocial disorder that severely impairs the patients\u2019 quality of life. 2 The incidence of PCOS is 6%\u201010% according to the National Institute of Health criteria, which reaches 15% based on the broader Rotterdam criteria. 3 PCOS is characterised by increasing ovarian stroma and antral follicles, in addition to ovarian cortical thickening and theca cell hyperplasia. 4 Women with PCOS are highly vulnerable to anovulation and infertility, and even such risk factors (obesity, abnormal uterine bleeding and diabetes) contributing to the development of endometrial cancer. 5 Multiple studies have provided evidence for the role of molecular targets in the treatment of PCOS, which include long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and corresponding target genes. 6 , 7 , 8   LncRNA profiles in granulosa cells from patients with PCOS and healthy women demonstrate that dysregulated lncRNAs may play significant roles in steroidogenesis and granulosa cell proliferation, shedding lights on the aetiology of PCOS. 9 LncRNAs have emerged as important epigenetic mediators with critical functions in the development and disease. 10 , 11 , 12 HOTAIR is a 2158\u00a0bp lncRNA localised to a boundary in the HOXC gene cluster. 13 HOTAIR is highly expressed in primary breast tumours and the metastases, and the HOTAIR expression in primary tumours has been revealed to be a critical predictor of metastasis and death. 14 For example, HOTAIR expression is associated with the metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer and could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in epithelial ovarian cancer. 15 In this study, we found that HOTAIR up\u2010regulated the expression of insulin\u2010like growth factor 1 (IGF1) via competitive binding to microRNA\u2010130a (miR\u2010130a). A study has pointed out that miR\u2010130a expression was associated with MDR1/P\u2013glycoprotein\u2010mediated drug resistance in the ovarian cancer cells. 16 IGF1 is a polypeptide hormone with high structural similarity to human pro\u2010insulin, and thus alterations of IGF1 activity has been proposed as an option in the treatment of endocrine disorders. 17 Higher serum levels of IGF1 in PCOS women were previously reported to be correlated to the increased vascularity, which leads to the increased blood flow. 18 Accordingly, we hypothesised that the expression of HOTAIR and miR\u2010130a might associate with the development of PCOS and their effects were exerted through regulating the expression of IGF1 in ovarian granulosa cells.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Experimental animals  Totally, 90 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (aged 21 d) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Before being used in the experiments, the rats were allowed to adapt to the environment for 2 d. These rats were kept under controlled environmental conditions (22\u201026\u00b0C; 12\u00a0hours light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. The rats aged 23\u00a0day were classified into the normal group (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and PCOS group (n\u00a0=\u00a080). After model establishment, 10 PCOS rats were used to identify the modelling. After successful modelling, the rest 70 rat models of PCOS were assigned into 7 groups with 10 in each group: control group, EP group (injected with empty plasmid through the caudal vein), si\u2010HOTAIR group (injected with siRNA plasmid against HOTAIR through the caudal vein), oe\u2010HOTAIR group (injected with overexpression plasmid of HOTAIR through the caudal vein), negative control (NC) group (injected with NC of miR\u2010130a through the caudal vein), miR\u2010130a mimics group (injected with miR\u2010130a mimics through the caudal vein) and miR\u2010130a inhibitors group (injected with miR\u2010130a inhibitors through the caudal vein). The empty plasmid, siRNA plasmid against HOTAIR, overexpression plasmid of HOTAIR, NC of miR\u2010130a, miR\u2010130a mimics and miR\u2010130a inhibitors were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Pudong district, Shanghai, China). The animal experimental processes were approved by the Ethics Committee of The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University.    2.2  Model establishment and identification of PCOS  From the age of 23\u00a0days, PCOS rats were subcutaneous injected with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulphate and sodium prasterone sulphate (9\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g bodyweight) and 0.4\u00a0mL water for injection, which lasted for 20 days. Rats in the normal group were injected with 0.4\u00a0mL water for injection at the same time point every day. At 20 days later, the rats were deprived of food for 12\u00a0hours. Then the ovaries were extracted. Through vaginal smear, the oestrous cycle was determined. Serum hormonal levels, haematoxylin\u2010eosin (HE) staining, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2010mediated dUTP nick\u2010end labelling (TUNEL) assay were adopted to identify the models. When the models were determined as successful, the rats of each group were treated correspondingly the next day, and the continuous injection lasted for 7 days.    2.3  Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  Rats of all the groups were deprived of food but not water after last injection. Following blood collection from heart, the serum was isolated. ELISA was employed to determine serum levels of follicle\u2010stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), teststerone (T) and oestradiol (E 2 ) (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). The rats were euthanised by cervical dislocation, with both ovaries extracted. The morphology and colour of ovaries were observed. The weight was measured and recorded.    2.4  Haematoxylin and eosin staining  One side of the ovary was prepared and fixed in 10% formaldehyde for more than 24\u00a0hours. Then the ovary was dehydrated in gradient ethanol, permeabilised by xylene and embedded in paraffin after dipping in wax. The ovary was sliced to sections with a thickness of 4\u00a0\u03bcm. Subsequently, the sections were dewaxed and hydrated, followed by HE staining. After the treatment of gradient ethanol, the stained sections were permeabilised by xylene and mounted in neutral balsam. The morphological structures of ovarian follicles were observed under a light microscope.    2.5  Transmission electron microscope (TEM) to observe ultrastructure of ovarian follicles  One side of the ovary was prepared and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 24\u00a0hours, followed by slicing into blocks (1\u00a0mm 3 ). The ovarian blocks were immersed overnight after repeated rinsing by 0.1\u00a0mol/L phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). Then the blocks were fixed in 1% osmic acid at 4\u00b0C for 2\u00a0hours, followed by washing by deionised water for three times (5\u00a0min per wash). At 4\u00b0C, the ovarian blocks were dehydrated in gradient acetone and embedded, followed by polymerising at 70\u00b0C for 36\u00a0hours. Next, the blocks were sliced to semi\u2010thin sections, which were stained by azure\u2010methylene blue and localised under a light microscope. Then, the sections were made to ultrathin sections, treated with double electron stain of uranyl acetate\u2010lead citrate. Under the TEM, the ultrastructures of ovarian granulosa cells, theca cells and lutein cells were observed and photographed.    2.6  TUNEL assay  The paraffin\u2010embedded ovarian tissues were collected for TUNEL staining. The number of apoptotic cells in the view field (\u00d7200) was calculated. Ten fields were counted and apoptotic cells in each field were recorded. The brown particles represented positive cells. The apoptotic index (AI)\u00a0=\u00a0(number of apoptotic cells/total cell number)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100%.    2.7  Separation and culture of ovarian granulosa cells  The ovarian tissues of PCOS rats were collected and immersed in normal saline immediately. Under a microscope, the capsule of ovaries and surrounding adipose tissues were removed. Normal saline was used again to rinse the erythrocytes on the surface. The ovarian tissues were placed in the serum\u2010free DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), where the follicles were pierced to release ovarian granulosa cells. Then, the ovarian granulosa cells were gently triturated to suspend single cells, which were filtered by a 200 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000\u00a0rpm for 8\u00a0minutes with supernatant discarded and cells harvested. The deposited ovarian granulosa cells were added with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 15% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island) for incubation in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. The medium was replaced 24\u00a0hours later when the cells adhered to the wall. After the adhered cells were removed, the mixture was further incubated. When the cell confluence reached 80%, the cells were detached, and the cells were harvested after centrifugation. The deposited granulosa cells were added with DMEM/F12 medium and triturated to prepare cell suspension, which were stained by trypan blue. The cells were counted under the microscope and then subcultured.    2.8  Cell grouping and treatment  The ovarian granulosa cells at logarithmic growth phase were grouped as follows: blank group (without any treatment), EP group (transfected with empty plasmid), si\u2010HOTAIR group (transfected with siRNA plasmid against HOTAIR), oe\u2010HOTAIR group (transfected with overexpression plasmid of HOTAIR), NC group (transfected with NC of miR\u2010130a) and miR\u2010130a mimics group (transfected with miR\u2010130a mimics). According to the instructions of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), the cells were transfected and incubated in the incubators for 48\u00a0hours, followed by subsequent experiments.    2.9  Dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay  The binding sites of lncRNA HOTAIR and miR\u2010130a were predicted by the bioinformatics website ( https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Interactive/ ). Next, binding relationship between lncRNA HOTAIR and miR\u2010130a was confirmed by using the dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay. The synthesised gene fragments of miR\u2010130a 3\u2019UTR were inserted into the pMIR\u2010REPORT\u2122 miRNA Expression Reporter Vector System (AM5795; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) through such endonuclease sites as SpeI and Hind III. Complementary mutation sites were designed on the wild\u2010type (WT) miR\u2010130a. Through T4 DNA ligase, the target fragments (WT sequence and MUT sequence) were inserted into the pMIR\u2010REPORT\u2122 miRNA Expression Reporter Vector System following restriction endonuclease cleavage. The right luciferase reporter plasmid WT and MUT after sequencing were cotransfected into the ovarian granulosa cells. After 48\u00a0hours of transfection, the 293T cells were harvested and lysed. The luciferase activity was evaluated by a dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Biovision) and a Glomax20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The experiment was conducted for three times.  The bioinformatics website ( http://www.targetscan.org ) was searched to predict the targeting relationship between miR\u2010130a and IGF1 as well as the binding sites of miR\u2010130a and IGF1 mRNA 3\u2019UTR. The IGF1 mRNA 3\u2019UTR promoter region sequence containing miR\u2010130a binding sites were synthesised, and IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010WT plasmid was constructed. On the basis of IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010WT plasmid, binding sites were mutated to construct IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010MUT plasmid, and the vector plasmid of IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010WT plasmid and IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010MUT plasmid were constructed by pMIR\u2010REPORT\u2122 miRNA Expression Reporter Vector System (AM5795; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The experiment was performed according to the instructions of plasmid extraction kit (Promega). Cells in logarithmically growing were seeded in the 96\u2010well plate. When cell confluence reached 70%, cells were transfected according to instructions of lipofectamine 2000. IGF1 3\u2019UTR\u2010WT plasmid and miR\u2010130a mimics plasmid were mixed and transfected into the ovarian granulosa cells. IGF1\u20103\u2019UTR\u2010WT\u00a0+\u00a0NC and IGF1\u20103\u2019UTR\u2010MUT\u00a0+\u00a0NC were, respectively, cotransfected with IGF1\u20103\u2019UTR\u2010MUT\u00a0+\u00a0miR\u2010130a mimics. After transfection of 48\u00a0hours, cells were harvested and lysed. The luciferase activity was detected by using a dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay kit. The experiment was conducted for three times.    2.10  RNA\u2010pull down  Cells were transfected with WT biotinylated miR\u2010130a and MUT biotinylated miR\u2010130a (50\u00a0nmol/L for each), respectively. After transfection of 48\u00a0hours, cells were harvested and washed by PBS and incubated for 10\u00a0minutes in specific cell lysate (Ambion). The sample cell lysate was collected separately (50\u00a0mL). Residual lysis was incubated with M\u2010280 streptavidin magnetic beads (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) coated with RNase\u2010free and yeast tRNA (Sigma) for 3\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C. After washing in ice\u2010cold lysate two times, cells were rinsed in low\u2010salt buffer for three times and in high\u2010salt buffer once. Antagonist miR\u2010130a probe was set as a NC. Trizol method was adopted to extract total RNA. The expression of lncRNA HOTAIR was determined by reverse transcription\u2010quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR).    2.11  RNA isolation and quantitation  Total RNA of tissues and cells was extracted by Trizol method (Invitrogen). The high quality of RNA was confirmed by ultra\u2010violet analysis and formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Then 1\u00a0\u03bcg RNA was collected, which was reversely transcribed by avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) to obtain cDNA. The primers of PCR were designed and synthesised by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) (Table 1 ), with glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or U6 as an internal reference. The amplification conditions were pre\u2010denaturation (94\u00b0C) for 5\u00a0minutes, denaturation (94\u00b0C) for 40\u00a0seconds, and followed by annealing for 40\u00a0seconds at 60\u00b0C, DNA strands extension for 1\u00a0minute at 72\u00b0C, this protocol ran for 40 cycles, followed by extension for 10\u00a0minutes at 72\u00b0C. The PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Threshold value was manually selected at the lowest point of all the parallelly rising logarithmic amplification curves, and the threshold cycle (Ct) value of each reaction tube was obtained. The data were analysed by 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct , which represents the multiple proportions of target gene expression of the experimental group to the control group. The formula was: \u0394\u0394Ct\u00a0=\u00a0(\u0394Ct target gene \u2212\u00a0\u0394Ct reference gene ) experimental group \u2212\u00a0(\u0394Ct target gene \u2212\u00a0\u0394Ct reference gene ) control group . The experiment was conducted for three times with mean value calculated.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd      2.12  Western blot analysis  The protein of tissues and cells were extracted, the protein concentration of which was examined according to the instructions of bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, Hubei, China). The extracted protein added with uploading buffer was boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0minutes. The extracted protein was uploaded with 30\u00a0\u03bcg for each well. Next, the extracted proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd.), with electrophoresis voltage transferring from 80 to 120\u00a0V by wet transfer. Subsequently, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with transferring voltage of 100\u00a0mV for 45\u201070\u00a0minutes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1\u00a0hour. Primary antibodies of IGF1 and \u03b2\u2010actin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were added and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by washing three times (5\u00a0min per wash) in TBST. Corresponding secondary antibodies (Shanghai Miaotong Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) were added and incubated for 1\u00a0hour. The membranes were washed for three times (5\u00a0min per wash). Chemiluminescence reagents were employed to develop images. \u03b2\u2010actin was considered as an internal reference. The images of the gels were developed by the Bio\u2010Rad Gel Doc EZ Imager (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The grey values of target protein bands were analysed by ImageJ software(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA). The experiment was conducted for three times with mean value calculated.    2.13  Cell counting kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108) assay  Cells of all the groups were collected. The former medium was discarded before detection. Each well was added with freshly prepared pre\u2010warmed mixture (100\u00a0\u03bcL) containing DMEM/F12 and 10% CCK\u20108 (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Dongjiang District, Shanghai, China). The mixture was added to the 96\u2010well plate by replacing the medium. At the same time, blank control well was set, which was only added with the mixture of DMEM/F12 and CCK\u20108. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C. The optical density (OD) value of each group was measured with a wavelength of 450\u00a0nm at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0hours, respectively. The experiment was conducted for three times with mean value calculated.    2.14  Flow cytometry  Cells at logarithmic growth phase were detached in trypsin. Then cells were harvested after centrifugation, with supernatant discarded. Then cells were rinsed in pre\u2010cooled PBS at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 1000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0minutes, which was repeated two times. The cell density was adjusted to 10 6 cells/mL. Subsequently, 200\u00a0\u03bcL cells were washed by 1\u00a0mL pre\u2010cooled PBS two times and centrifuged. Next, the cells were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL binding buffer, with 2\u00a0\u03bcL Annexin V\u2010FITC (20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) added. Then cells were allowed to stand on the ice for 15\u00a0minutes without light exposure, followed by transferring to the flow tube. With 300\u00a0\u03bcL PBS added, each sample was also supplemented with 1\u00a0\u03bcL of PI (50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) before uploading. The samples were detected within 30\u00a0minutes. With Annexin V as the X\u2010axis and PI as the Y\u2010axis, left upper quadrant represents mechanically injured cells, right upper quadrant represents late\u2010stage apoptotic cells or necrotic cells, left lower quadrant represents negative normal cells and right lower quadrant represents early apoptotic cells.    2.15  Statistical analysis  SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was employed to analyse data in this study. Measurement data are expressed by mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation. Normally distributed measurement data between two groups were analysed by t test and comparison among multiple groups by one\u2010way analysis of variance. Pairwise comparison was conducted by the least significant difference t test. P <\u00a0.05 was accepted as indicative of significant differences.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Rat model of PCOS is successfully established  From the 10 days following modelling, vaginal smear of rats was examined every day. Through the observation of 10 days, the rats in the normal group maintained regular oestrous cycle; whereas the rat models of PCOS had irregular oestrous cycle without ovulation.  The serum hormonal levels of rats were measured (Figure 1 A\u2010D). Compared with the normal group, the serum levels of E 2 , T and LH were increased and serum levels of FSH were reduced in the PCOS group (all P <\u00a0.05).   Figure 1   Identification of the establishment of rat models of PCOS. Note: A, serum levels of E 2 in PCOS rat models and normal rats determined by ELISA; B, serum levels of T in PCOS rat models and normal rats determined by ELISA; C, serum levels of LH in PCOS rat models and normal rats determined by ELISA; D, serum levels of FSH in PCOS rat models and normal rats determined by ELISA; E, weight of ovaries of PCOS rat models and normal rats; F, HE staining to observe histopathological changes of ovarian tissues of PCOS rat models and normal rats (\u00d7100); G, the ultrastructures of ovaries of PCOS rat models and normal rats observed under a TEM (\u00d710\u00a0000); ** P <\u00a0.01 compared with the normal group; PCOS, polycystic ovaries syndrome; ELISA, enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay; E 2 , oestradiol; T, teststerone; LH, luteinising hormone; FSH, follicle\u2010stimulating hormone; and TEM, transmission electron microscope     The general conditions of ovaries of rats were observed (Figure 1 E). The rat ovaries in the normal group had red colour. In the PCOS group, the ovaries of rats were pale with increased size and saccular dilatation follicles observed on the surface. The weight of ovaries in the PCOS group was higher than that in the normal group ( P <\u00a0.05).  HE staining was used to observe the morphology of rat ovaries (Figure 1 F). In the normal group, follicles of different developmental stages and many lutein cells were found on the cutting surface of ovaries; we also observed oocytes and corona radiata in mature follicles, uniformly aligned granulosa cells with intact morphology and thick cell layers (mostly 8\u20109 layers). In the rat models of PCOS, plenty of saccular dilatation follicles were observed under the integumentumon the cutting surface of ovaries; the granulosa cells were loosely aligned, and the cell layers became thinner; proliferated thecal cells and a few lutein cells could be seen.  The ultrastructures of ovaries were observed under a TEM (Figure 1 G). A number of mitochondria, granular endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets and microtubules were found in the normal group. In the PCOS group, the granulosa cells turned spindle\u2010shaped and the shape of nucleus was irregular; chromatin condensation inside the nucleus and intercellular fibrous proliferation could be seen; more layers of theca cells and lipid droplets in the thecal cells were observed. The aforementioned findings were highly suggestive of successful establishment of rat models of PCOS.    3.2  HOTAIR is highly expressed in ovarian tissues of PCOS rat models  The expression of HOTAIR in the ovarian tissues of rats in the normal and PCOS groups was measured by using RT\u2010qPCR. PCOS rat models showed higher expression of HOTAIR than the normal rats ( P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 2 A), which was indicative of the association of HOTAIR with PCOS.   Figure 2   A high level of HOTAIR expression was identified in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rat models. Note: A, the expression of HOTAIR in the ovarian tissues of rats in the normal and PCOS groups detected by RT\u2010qPCR; B, the efficiency of interference to the HOTAIR expression was assessed by RT\u2010qPCR; ** P <\u00a0.01 compared with the normal group or control group; PCOS, polycystic ovaries syndrome; and RT\u2010qPCR, reverse transcription\u2010quantitative polymerase chain reaction     The efficiency of interference to the HOTAIR expression in ovarian tissues was assessed by RT\u2010qPCR. Compared with the control and EP groups, the HOTAIR expression in ovarian tissues was significantly reduced in the si\u2010HOTAIR group and elevated in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group (both P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 2 B), suggesting successful interference to the HOTAIR expression in PCOS rat models.    3.3  HOTAIR accelerates endocrine disorders, ovarian injury and apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells  In comparison to the control and EP groups, the serum levels of E 2 , T and LH were increased and serum levels of FSH were decreased in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group, whereas the situation was reversed in the si\u2010HOTAIR group (all P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 3 A\u2010D).

HE staining (Figure 3 F) was employed to observe the effect of oe\u2010HOTAIR and si\u2010HOTAIR on pathological changes of ovaries. In the control and EP groups, obviously saccular dilatation follicles and loosely aligned granulosa cells were observed; the layers of granulosa cells were reduced and the majority was 3\u20104 layers; the thecal cells were proliferated and lutein cells were reduced. In the si\u2010HOTAIR group, no or little cystic dilatation was found in ovarian follicles; we also observed increased layers of granulosa cells, and oocytes and corona radiata in the dominant follicles. In the oe\u2010HOTAIR group, lutein cells and follicle development of different stages in the ovaries were decreased; few dominant follicles could be observed; reduced granulosa cells, atretic follicle and saccular dilatation follicles were observed.  Under a TEM, the ultrastructures of ovaries were observed (Figure 3 G). In the control and EP groups, ovarian granulosa cells were irregularly shaped; plenty of round, oval or irregular mitochondria were found in the cytoplasm; some of the mitochondrial cristae were vacuolated; ribosome, granular endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex were abundant. In the oe\u2010HOTAIR group, plenty of mitochondria in round, oval or irregular shapes were observed in the granulosa cells; the mitochondrial cristae were vacuolated. In the si\u2010HOTAIR group, the cytoplasm of granulosa cells was abundant, in which a number of granular endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum could be found; the mitochondria was reduced, most of which were round or oval shaped and a minority of which were in irregular shape; scattered lipid droplets and lysosomes were observed; the nuclei were in round or oblong shapes with uniform sizes.  TUNEL staining was used to evaluate the effect of HOTAIR on the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells (Figure 3 H\u2010I). Compared with the control and EP groups, the AI of ovarian granulosa cells was increased in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group and decreased in the si\u2010HOTAIR group ( P <\u00a0.05).    3.4  HOTAIR inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells  The efficiency of interference to the HOTAIR expression in ovarian granulosa cells was assessed by RT\u2010qPCR. Compared with the blank and EP groups, the HOTAIR expression in ovarian granulosa cells was elevated in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group and reduced in the si\u2010HOTAIR group ( P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 4 A), suggesting successful interference to the HOTAIR expression in ovarian granulosa cells of PCOS rat models.

No significant difference was found between the blank and EP groups in the viability of ovarian granulosa cells ( P >\u00a0.05). The viability of ovarian granulosa cells was increased in the si\u2010HOTAIR group and inhibited in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group, as compared with the blank and EP groups ( P <\u00a0.05).  The effect of HOTAIR on the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells was examined by flow cytometry (Figure 4 C\u2010D). The apoptosis rate of ovarian granulosa cells was higher in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group and lower in si\u2010HOTAIR group than the blank and EP groups ( P <\u00a0.05). These results indicated that up\u2010regulated HOTAIR expression could suppress the proliferation and facilitate the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells.    3.5  HOTAIR inhibits expression of miR\u2010130a and promotes expression of IGF1 in ovarian tissues and granulosa cells  HOTAIR was expressed at a high level in ovarian tissues of PCOS rat models. According to the results of RT\u2010qPCR (Figure 5 A\u2010D), lower expression of miR\u2010130a and higher expression of IGF1 were identified in the ovarian tissues of the PCOS rat models than the normal rats ( P <\u00a0.05), suggesting that HOTAIR may negatively regulate the expression of miR\u2010130a and positively regulate the expression of IGF1 in PCOS rat models.   Figure 5   The effect of HOTAIR on the expression of miR\u2010130a and IGF1 in the ovarian tissues and granulosa cells.

Compared with the control and EP groups, the expression of miR\u2010130a was increased in the si\u2010HOTAIR group and decreased in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group; besides, the expression of IGF1 was reduced in the si\u2010HOTAIR group and elevated in the oe\u2010HOTAIR group ( P <\u00a0.05).  Furthermore, the effect of HOTAIR on the expression of miR\u2010130a and IGF1 in the ovarian granulosa cells was also determined (Figure 5 I\u2010L). Compared with the blank and EP groups, the oe\u2010HOTAIR group showed reduced expression of miR\u2010130a and increased expression of IGF1; the si\u2010HOTAIR group displayed increased expression of miR\u2010130a and decreased expression of IGF1 ( P <\u00a0.05). The aforementioned findings implied that up\u2010regulated expression of HOTAIR could negatively regulate the expression of miR\u2010130a and positively regulate the expression of IGF1.    3.6  HOTAIR up\u2010regulates the expression of IGF1 via competitively binding to miR\u2010130a  Bioinformatics online software analysis demonstrated specific binding region of HOTAIR gene sequence to miR\u2010130a sequence (Figure 6A). Dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to confirm the binding relationship of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a (Figure 6 B). Compared with the NC group, the luciferase activity in the WT oe\u2010HOTAIR group was reduced ( P <\u00a0.05), and no significant difference was identified in the MUT luciferase activity ( P >\u00a0.05), suggesting the binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a.   Figure 6   The identification of competitive binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a as well as bindings of miR\u2010130a and IGF1. Note: A, the binding sites of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a predicted by bioinformatic online software; B, the luciferase activity detected by dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay to verify the binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a; C, the binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a confirmed by RNA\u2010pull down assay; D, the expression of miR\u2010130a in the ovarian granulosa cells; E, the mRNA expression of IGF1 in the ovarian granulosa cells; F, the protein expression of IGF1 in the ovarian granulosa cells; G, the protein band patterns of IGF1 in the ovarian granulosa cells; H, the binding sites of miR\u2010130a to IGF1 predicted by bioinformatic online software; I, the luciferase activity detected by dual\u2010luciferase reporter gene assay to verify the targeting relationship of miR\u2010130a to IGF1; * P <\u00a0.05 compared with the NC group or blank group; PCOS, polycystic ovaries syndrome; NC, negative control     RNA\u2010pull down assay results (Figure 6 C) indicated that, compared with the Bio\u2010probe NC group, the expression of HOTAIR in the Bio\u2010miR\u2010130a\u2010WT group was significantly increased ( P <\u00a0.05); besides, no difference was determined in the Bio\u2010miR\u2010130a\u2010MUT group ( P >\u00a0.05). These results implied that Bio\u2010miR\u2010130a\u2010WT could promote the enrichment of HOTAIR around it, following which, the competitive binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a reduced the dissociation of miR\u2010130a.  In comparison with the blank and NC groups, the expression of miR\u2010130a was increased in the miR\u2010130a mimics group and decreased in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group; moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of IGF1 was decreased in the miR\u2010130a mimics group and increased in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group ( P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 6 D\u2010G). Thus, we could conclude that the interference to the expression of miR\u2010130a in the ovarian granulosa cells was successful and miR\u2010130a negatively regulated the expression of IGF1.  Bioinformatics online software ( http://www.targetscan.org ) predicted the targeting relationship of miR\u2010130a and IGF1 (Figure 6H). The IGF1\u20103'UTR\u2010WT plasmid and miR\u2010130a mimics were cotransfected in the ovary granulosa cells. In the WT, the luciferase activity in the IGF1\u20103'UTR\u2010WT\u00a0+\u00a0NC group was lower than that in the IGF1\u20103'UTR\u2010WT\u00a0+\u00a0miR\u2010130a mimics group ( P <\u00a0.05). In the MUT, the luciferase activity in the IGF1\u20103'UTR\u2010MUT\u00a0+\u00a0NC group didn't differ from that in the IGF1\u20103'UTR\u2010MUT\u00a0+\u00a0miR\u2010130a mimics group ( P >\u00a0.05) (Figure 6 I). The aforementioned results indicated that HOTAIR repressed the inhibitory effect of miR\u2010130a on IGF1 and increased the expression of IGF1 by competitive binding to miR\u2010130a.    3.7  MiR\u2010130a attenuates endocrine disorders, ovarian injury and apoptosis of ovarian\u00a0granulosa cells  The serum levels of E 2 , T and LH were not significantly different between the control group and NC group (all P >\u00a0.05). Compared with the control and NC groups, serum levels of E 2 , T and LH were reduced and serum levels of FSH were elevated in the miR\u2010130a mimics group, whereas the situation was reversed in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group ( P <\u00a0.05; Figure 7 A\u2010D).  The weight of ovary in the miR\u2010130a mimics group was lower and that in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group was higher, when compared with the control and NC groups ( P <\u00a0.05; Figure 7 E).

In the miR\u2010130a mimics group, cystic dilatation in ovarian follicles was reduced and layers of granulosa cells were increased. In the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group, plenty of saccular dilatation follicles could be seen; lutein cells and follicle development of different stages in the ovaries were decreased; few dominant follicles and granulosa cells could be observed (Figure 7 F).  The ultrastructures of ovaries were observed under a TEM (Figure 7G). In the control and NC groups, ovarian granulosa cells were irregularly shaped; plenty of round, oval or irregular mitochondria and vacuolated mitochondrial cristae were found in the cytoplasm. In the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group, large numbers of round, oval or irregular mitochondria and obviously vacuolated mitochondrial cristae were observed in the ovarian granulosa cells. In the miR\u2010130a mimics group, a number of granular endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum could be found in the ovarian granulosa cells; the mitochondria was reduced, most of which were round or oval shaped; almost no lipid droplets and few lysosomes were observed; the nuclei were in round shape with uniform sizes.  TUNEL staining was used to evaluate the effect of miR\u2010130a on the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells (Figure 7 H\u2010I). The AI of ovarian granulosa cells was lower in the miR\u2010130a mimics group and higher in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group than the control and NC groups ( P <\u00a0.05).    3.8  MiR\u2010130a enhances proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells  The effect of miR\u2010130a on the viability of ovarian granulosa cells was examined by CCK\u20108 assay (Figure 8 A). Increased viability and proliferation rate of ovarian granulosa cells was found in the miR\u2010130a mimics group; reduced \u00a0viability and proliferation rate of ovarian granulosa cells was identified in the miR\u2010130a inhibitors group, as compared with the blank and NC groups ( P <\u00a0.05).

The apoptosis rate of ovarian granulosa cells was lower in the miR\u2010130a mimics group and higher in miR\u2010130a inhibitors group than the blank and NC groups ( P <\u00a0.05). These results indicated that up\u2010regulated miR\u2010130a expression could promote the proliferation and impede the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells.     4  DISCUSSION  PCOS, as the most common cause of female infertility across the globe, is a multi\u2010causal and genetically complicated disorder, which is implicated in the failure in endocrine glands. 19 , 20 In the ovarian cancer, inhibited HOTAIR expression in ovarian cancer cells could impede the tumourgenesis and metastasis. 21 , 22 According to Deng et al, HOTAIR modulates the self\u2010renewal, growth, tumour metastatic and formation of the cancer stem\u2010like cell subpopulation enriched from breast cancer cells. 23 Moreover, the levels of IGF1 are elevated and may affect ovarian function and increase androgen production in PCOS. 24 Herein, we identified the expression of HOTAIR, miR\u2010130a and IGF1 in the ovarian tissues and granulosa cells of PCOS rat models and verified the regulatory relationships among them, so as to determine the mechanisms of controlling the endocrine disorders and activities of ovarian granulosa cells.  PCOS rat models were established by injection of DHEA. In the separated ovarian tissues and granulosa cells of rat models of PCOS, a high level of HOTAIR expression and IGF1 expression as well as a low level of miR\u2010130a expression were identified. It has been proved that HOTAIR rs920778 polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility and prognosis in a Chinese population. 25 Then, the therapeutic value of HOTAIR in ovarian and breast cancers has been demonstrated using tumour specific peptides inhibits HOTAIR activity. 26 Silencing of HOTAIR could inhibit the tumour growth and increase chemosensitivity of ovarian tumours in nude mice through regulation of HOXA7. 27 In this present study, we found that HOTAIR accelerated the endocrine disorders, ovarian injury and apoptosis of granulosa cells in rat models of PCOS. HOTAIR is located between HoxC11 and HoxC12 in the human genome and mediates HoxD expression in multiple tissues. 28 A study has revealed that IGF1 expression was elevated in human epithelial ovarian cancer samples in relation to that in benign ovarian tumour samples. 29 Another study also proved that IGF1 level was up\u2010regulated in plasma of well\u2010differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer. 30 As Zhang et al state that miR\u2010130a expression was markedly reduced in cisplatin\u2010resistant ovarian cancer cells. 31 Epigenetic alterations of HOX genes can be correlated with PCOS and consequently female infertility, which provide insight for novel treatments with epidrugs for this disease. Notably, HOTAIR was validated to negatively regulate the expression of miR\u2010130a and positively regulate the expression of IGF1 in PCOS rat models. Furthermore, we confirmed that HOTAIR repressed the inhibitory effect of miR\u2010130a on IGF1 and increased the expression of IGF1 by competitive binding to miR\u2010130a.  It has been suggested that miR\u2010130 expression interacting with Hox genes could control vascular morphogenesis in developing lung. 32 The role of miR\u2010130a was characterised in reducing HOXA5 expression, thus decreasing p53 expression and controlling breast cancer cells resulting in tumour progression and metastasis. 33 MiR\u2010130a attenuated endocrine disorders, ovarian injury and apoptosis of granulosa cells in rat models of PCOS. The expression of miR\u2010130a has been examined in ovarian cancer cells, and it is involved in the cell activities and drug resistance. 16 MiR\u2010130a may be a potential treatment target in ovarian cancers through inhibiting PTEN to activate PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. 34 According to a previous integrated gene network analysis, miR\u2010130a expression is associated with multidrug resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer by binding to NRP1. 35 MiR\u2010130a enhanced proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells in the rat models of PCOS of this study. MiR\u2010130a directly targeted and negatively regulated the expression of IGF1. When the expression of IGF1 was reduced, women with PCOS may be more sensitive to the treatment of octreotide. 36 IGF1 might be attributed to the increase in serum levels of LH and the consequent hyperandrogenic anovulation in women with PCOS. 37 , 38 The bioavailability of IGF1 has been reported to play a key role in oocyte maturation in PCOS patients. 39   By demonstrating that HOTAIR up\u2010regulated the expression of IGF1 via competitive binding to miR\u2010130a in the rat models of PCOS, we provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the promotion effect of up\u2010regulated HOTAIR expression in the endocrine disorders and granulosa cell apoptosis. We show that HOTAIR up\u2010regulates the expression of IGF1 and aggravates the endocrine disorders and granulosa cell apoptosis through competitive binding to miR\u2010130a in rat models of PCOS. Based on our finding, we predict that competitive binding of HOTAIR to miR\u2010130a may act as a novel target for the molecular treatment of PCOS. However, whether treatment will affect other organs and systems and whether it will directly or indirectly affect the ovaries will be explained in future study.
