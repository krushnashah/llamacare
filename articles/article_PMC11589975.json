    "abstract": "While the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and infertility on women\u2019s health have often\nbeen discussed, not many studies have assessed the other complications of infertility. One of these complications is\nfemale sexual dysfunction (FSD), a range of psychosexual disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence\nof FSD in PCOS and its comparison with other causes of infertility. In this cross-sectional study, two questionnaires were filled out by two groups (60 people\neach) of infertile patients, due to PCOS and other causes, referred to Arash Women\u2019s Hospital from December 2018\nto 2019. The data was analyzed in SPSS software to evaluate the frequency of FSD in the whole study population\nand each group separately as well as its relationship with age, history of pregnancy, the literacy level of the patient or\nspouse, body mass index (BMI), infertility duration, hirsutism, and acne. The frequency of FSD in the study group had a significant inverse relationship with the women\u2019s level of\neducation (P=0.044), although no such correlation was found with age, pregnancy history, spouse\u2019s literacy level,\nBMI, duration of infertility, acne, and hirsutism. In the comparison group, there was a significant relationship between\nthe duration of infertility and FSD (P=0.002). The prevalence of FSD in the study and comparison groups was 43.1\nand 52%, respectively. The prevalence of FSD sub-domains in all categories, except for pain, was higher in the study\ngroup. PCOS, compared to other groups, presented at a relatively younger age. In the PCOS group, patients with lower education levels were more likely to suffer from FSD. This suggests\nthe effect of education and awareness on the sexual performance of these people. No significant difference in\nFSD experience was found between PCOS and other groups.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the\nmost common endocrine and metabolic disorders\namong premenopausal women ( 1 ). It affects between 4\nand 8% of women of reproductive age. Being considered a heterogeneous condition, PCOS presents with\na combination of signs and symptoms linked with androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction. The underlying cause of the syndrome remains generally unknown;\nnevertheless, abundant evidence suggests PCOS as a\ncomplex polygenetic disorder influenced by strong\nepigenetic and environmental factors including dietary\nand lifestyle habits ( 1 , 2 ). The clinical manifestations\nof PCOS vary widely, ranging from menstrual disorders to clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism\nand infertility. Menstrual disorders in PCOS women may present as oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or prolonged irregular menstrual bleeding. This is while 30%\nof women suffering from PCOS have normal periods.\nApproximately 85 to 90% of women with oligomenorrhea have PCOS; this number is as low as 30-40%\nin those with amenorrhea. More than 80% of PCOS\nwomen present with various symptoms of hyperandrogenism. Hirsutism, a common clinical manifestation of\nandrogen excess, is reported in 70% of these women.\nMore than 90% of women with normal periods who\nsuffer from hirsutism are diagnosed with PCOS in ultrasound follow-ups ( 3 ). Acne, the other common sign\nof hyperandrogenism, however, is less common among\nPCOS women (15 to 30%) ( 4 ).  PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility ( 5 ). Approximately 90 to 95% of women visiting infertility clinics with anovulation are diagnosed\nwith PCOS. These women are reported to have normal\nnumber of primary follicles, but significantly increased\nsecondary ones ( 6 ). The follicular growth though is\ndisrupted in these women, limited to the diameter of 4\nto 8 mm. Ovulation, therefore, never happens in these\nwomen as no dominant follicle is ever formed ( 7 ). At\nthe same time, the evidence for intrauterine changes\nleading to PCOS is inconclusive.  Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a range of psycho-sexual disorders defined as disturbed sexual desire\nor psychological and physiological changes in sexual\nrelations, leading to significant tension and interpersonal issues ( 8 ). Despite the controversial link reported\nbetween FSD and PCOS, increased interest has been\nfocused on their relationship because of their high\nprevalence ( 8 - 10 ).  The results of studies on the relationship between\nPCOS and FSD are contradictory. Considering the significant impact of FSD on the quality of life of these\npatients, further studies are required in this field to help\nthe public health system identify their predisposing\nfactors and at-risk individuals. This would provide the\npolicymakers with the required information to design\nand implement a screening program. Therefore, this\nstudy was designed to determine the frequency of FSD\nin infertile patients with PCOS and compare it with infertile patients due to other causes.    Materials and Methods   Study design and subjects  This cross-sectional study compares the frequency of\nsexual dysfunction as the primary outcome in a group\nof infertile PCOS women and those suffering from infertility due to other causes. The secondary objective\nwas to identify the characteristics in PCOS women\nassociated with a higher prevalence of FSD. The two\nmentioned groups were recruited from those visiting\nthe infertility clinic of Arash Women\u2019s Hospital, Tehran, Iran between the beginning of December 2018 and\nthe end of November 2019.    Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The participants were married women between the\nages of 20 to 40 years. PCOS was diagnosed based on\nthe Rotterdam criteria, which requires at least two of\nthree findings, chronic anovulation, clinical or biochemical symptoms of hyperandrogenism, and the presence of polycystic ovaries in the ultrasound imaging\n( 11 ). In some cases, the diagnosis was made after ruling out other disorders mimicking PCOS [thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassical congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia (mainly 21-hydroxylase deficiency\ncharacterized by serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone)]. In\ncertain women with amenorrhea or more severe phenotypes of PCOS, further extensive evaluations were performed to rule out other possible causes such as pregnancy and Asherman syndrome ( 12 ). Accordingly, the\ndiagnosis was made based on the existence of clinical\nor biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after\nexcluding other pathologies) along with persistent oligomenorrhea. The comparison group included infertile\npatients due to reasons other than PCOS. Those with\na history of psychiatric disorders or taking psychiatric\nmedication, with a history of hospitalization in the past\nmonth, or taking oral contraceptive pills in the last two\nmonths were excluded. Subjects diagnosed with endometriosis were also excluded as the condition is accompanied by problems, including pain due to organic\nissues, interfering with the study objectives. Hirsutism\nwas assessed using a modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system. This tool assesses hair growth in seven areas: upper lip, chin, chest, back, abdomen, arms, and\nthighs. A score of zero suggests the absence of terminal\nhair growth and four suggests extensive growth. A total\nscore of eight or more indicates hirsutism.    Information collection  A questionnaire containing a personal and past medical history of the women was completed by a reliable\nobserver. The participants and their spouses were divided into five groups based on their education level\ninto illiterate, below diploma, diploma, bachelor's\ndegree and less, and master's degree and higher. A\ntranslated version of the female sexual function index\n(FSFI) questionnaire was completed for each subject.\nOver the past 20 years, the FSFI has been considered\nas the standard questionnaire for the assessment of\nsexual performance among women. The reliability of\nthe Persian version of this questionnaire has already\nbeen proven in earlier studies ( 13 ). The questionnaire\ncontains 19 questions on sexual performance during\nthe past four weeks in 6 areas, including sexual desire,\npsychological arousal, vaginal moisture, peak sexual\npleasure, satisfaction, and pain during intercourse. A\nscore between 0 and 5 can be given for each question.\nThe scores for each field are then calculated by adding that of all the questions in each section and then\nmultiplying the result by a certain factorial number,\nrecommended by the developer ( 14 ). This number aims to balance the weight of different fields based on the\nnumber of questions in each section. The total score is,\nfinally, calculated by adding the scores of the six sections. The maximum score for each section is six and\nthus 36 for the whole questionnaire. A higher total score\nindicates better sexual performance. The cut-off point\nfor the whole questionnaire is 28 and for each subscale\nis sexual desire at 3.3, psychological stimulation at 3.4,\nvaginal moisture at 3.4, peak sexual pleasure at 3.4,\nsatisfaction at 3.8, and pain during the relationship at\n3.8. In other words, scores higher than the cut-off point\nindicate good performance and lower ones show sexual\ndysfunction. A score of zero indicates no sexual activity during the past four weeks.    Sample size calculation  The sample size was calculated based on the data\ngathered in previous studies [expected FSD prevalence\nof 60% ( 10 )], and a power of 95%. Fifteen percent was\nadded to compensate for possible data loss, resulting in\na sample size of 120 patients.    Statistical analysis  The data were analyzed using SPSS 25 (IBM Corp.,\nArmonk, New York, USA). In addition to the frequency of sexual dysfunction and its subdomains in the two\nstudied groups, the relationship between FSD and age,\nthe history of pregnancy, the literacy level of the patient\nand her spouse, (BMI) profile, the duration of infertility,\nhirsutism, and acne were assessed. Mann-Whitney U test\nwas used to assess the non-parametric variables (age and\nduration of infertility) as well as to compare the education\nlevel of the patients and their spouses between the two\ngroups. The chi-square test helped to assess the relationship between the qualitative variables and FSD, whereas\nthe independent t test illustrated the correlation between\nthe quantitative variables and sexual dysfunction. Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to compare the sexual function\nsubdomains in the two groups, due to the small number of\ncases. As for pain during intercourse, however, chi-square\nwas applied due to the higher number of cases affected by\nthe problem.    Ethical considerations  The purpose, optionality, and confidentiality of the\nstudy were explained separately to each patient and\nwritten consent was obtained from those who agreed to\nenter the study. The study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences\n(IR.TUMS.MEDICINE.REC.1398.585).     Results  Overall, 120 women agreed to participate in the study.\nThe mean age of the study group was lower than that of\nthe comparison group (30.6 vs. 33.9, P=0.001). The demographic and past medical history of the two groups\nis shown in Table 1 . There was a significant difference\nin their education level (P=0.035), the presence of hirsutism (58.6 vs. 16%, P<0.001), and acne (43.1 vs. 18%,\nP=0.005). There were significantly more women with\nhigher education in the comparison group, while such\na difference was not reported for the education level of\nthe spouse (P=0.235). Women in the comparison group,\non the other hand, reported a higher number of previous\npregnancies (41.4 vs. 24%, P=0.056). This, however, was\nnot statistically significant. As for BMI and the duration of\ninfertility, similarly, no significant difference was noted.  Table 1 compares the FSFI score and the prevalence\nof FSD between the two groups. The average FSFI\nscore was higher in the study group; though the difference was not statistically significant (28.55 vs. 28.33,\nP=0.730). FSD was less prevalent among the study\ngroup (43.1 vs. 52%, P=0.440).

Table 2 illustrates the relationship between the demographic information and past medical history, and\nthe presence of sexual dysfunction in PCOS patients.\nThere was no significant relationship between age,\nBMI, duration of infertility, and sexual dysfunction.\nThe women with FSD and their spouses were reported\nto have lower educational levels. The difference was\nonly significant in the women and not among their\nspouses. As for the comparison group, no significant relationship was found between age and BMI, and\nsexual dysfunction ( Table 3 ). The average duration of\ninfertility in women with FSD was significantly longer\nthan that of those with no such disorder (6.7 years vs.\n3.7 years, P=0.002, Fig .1 ).

Discussion  The present cross-sectional study showed a significant\ndifference in the level of education, the prevalence of hirsutism, and acne between the PCOS women and the comparison group. However, there was no significant difference in the history of previous pregnancies between these\ngroups.  The prevalence of FSD among women with and without\nPCOS was 35 and 29.6% according to a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Loh et al. ( 15 ) and\n30.1% among infertile women due to PCOS aging between 18-35 ( 16 ). A systematic review and meta-analysis\nconducted on 3419 infertile Iranian women estimated the\nprevalence of FSD in this population to be about 64.3%\n( 17 ). Dashti et al. ( 18 ) reported that 62.5% of women\nwith PCOS complained of FSD symptoms, highlighting\nthe prevalence of the condition in the general society to\nbe between 5.5 to 11.2 percent. This is while a prevalence\nof as high as 46.2% was previously reported for FSD in\nwomen of reproductive age ( 19 , 20 ). According to a crosssectional study conducted in Iran, FSD is seen in 98.8%\nof women with PCOS, 100% of those with endometriosis,\nand 36.2% of fertile women ( 21 ). Similarly, a cross-sectional study conducted between 2006 and 2009 at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n(NICHD) in China, and a case-control study conducted\nin 2013 in Turkey, reported FSD to be more prevalent\namong PCOS women (27.2 vs. 24.4% and 25 vs. 19%\nrespectively). This is while our results revealed a lower\nprevalence of FSD among PCOS women ( 22 , 23 ). This\nis while several studies have suggested that PCOS has no\nsignificant effect on women\u2019s sexual performance. In a\ncase-control study conducted by Basirat et al. ( 24 ), no significant difference was revealed between the prevalence\nof FSD in infertile women due to PCOS and other causes.  The present study revealed PCOS women to be more\neducated and less likely to suffer from FSD. In line with\nour results, a cross-sectional study conducted in Iran between 2009 and 2011 showed a significant relationship\nbetween FSD and the subjects\u2019 education level, but not\nwith age or BMI ( 10 ). Jaafarpour et al. ( 19 ), similarly\nshowed the education level to have an inverse correlation with FSD. They revealed the FSD patients to be significantly older, pointing out the condition to be more common among those performing intercourse less than three\ntimes a week, having three or more children, being married for 10 years or more, or having husbands older than\n40 years of age as well as being unemployed.  The higher prevalence of hirsutism and acne in PCOS\nwomen is related to the nature of the underlying disease\nand the high incidence of hyperandrogenism in these patients; a high prevalence of hirsutism, however, is reported\namong those with FSD ( 25 ). This is in line with previous\nsimilar studies ( 20 , 24 ). In a study conducted by Ashrafi\net al. ( 21 ), a statistically significant difference was shown\nbetween the BMI and education level of women with the\nmost common causes of infertility.  From among the studied variables, a longer period of\ninfertility was the main risk factor linked with FSD. This\ncould be due to the longer duration of infertility can probably contribute to additional psychological disorders such\nas depression ( 26 ). This was the reason behind selecting\nbeing infertile due to other reasons as the comparison\ngroup in this study with the aim of eliminating its possible confounding effect on the results. Correspondingly, a\ncase-control study conducted by Dong et al. ( 26 ) revealed\nan increase in the incidence of FSD and psychological\ndistress, especially when the infertility duration is more\nthan 8 years.  Except for \"pain during intercourse,\" the frequency of\nthe disorders in all sub-areas was higher, though not significantly, in the study group. In line with the study conducted by Basirat et al. ( 24 ), we failed to observe a significant difference in the FSD sub-domains between the\nPCOS and the comparison group. Ashrafi et al. ( 21 ), on\nthe other hand, showed the disorders in all subdomains,\nexcept for \"Orgasm\" and \"pain during intercourse\", to be\nsignificantly higher in the PCOS group. The two exception subdomains, on the other hand, were more common\nin the endometriosis group. The observed differences\nwere statistically significant. This again points out the\nreason behind excluding the endometriosis patients from\nthe comparison group in the current study, as they are believed to be more prone to FSD due to the higher pain\nexperienced during intercourse (mainly secondary to organic rather than psychological issues).  PCOS, compared to other causes of infertility, appeared\nat a relatively younger age in our study. Despite the defined recruitment age range, the age and level of education in the comparison group were significantly higher\nthan in the study group. This could be attributed to the\nfact that infertility due to PCOS is easier to treat compared with cases secondary to causes such as endometriosis, anatomical problems, and reduced ovarian reserves\n( 15 , 16 ). As a result, some may suggest selecting healthy\nwomen rather than infertile ones as the comparison group\nto reduce the age difference between the studied groups.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the prevalence of FSD among PCOS and non-PCOS infertile women in Iran. The current study, however, suffered\nfrom several limitations. Firstly, due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, the assessment of the relationship\nbetween the variables as well as the longitudinal interpretations were not possible. Secondly, as the research\nwas conducted in a tertiary center, the study population\nmay not be representative of the entire society; therefore,\nconducting more studies in the future in different regions\nwith a larger sample size can help with the generalization\nof its results. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer\nvisits to the clinics, the sampling period lasted longer than\nthe estimated time.    Conclusion  The present study did not reveal any significant relationship between FSD and PCOS. However, due to the\ncontradictory nature of these results, compared with existing literature, more studies with larger sample sizes\nare needed. Our results however suggested that the level\nof education significantly influences FSD and educating\nwomen and increasing their awareness, therefore, can\nhelp improve their sexual performance. This is of great\nimportance as it can strongly impact their quality of life\nand their relationship with their spouses.",
