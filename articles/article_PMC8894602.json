    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized with hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction, irregular menstruation, and insulin resistance, is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in reproductive-age women ( 1 ). PCOS is the main cause of infertility in women of reproductive age. The global prevalence of PCOS ranges from 4% to 20% owing to differences in diagnostic criteria and population assessed in different geographic areas ( 2 , 3 ). Due to its obscure etiology and high heterogeneity of clinical manifestations, the available therapeutic strategies for PCOS mainly rely on symptoms while there is no cure yet. The complex interaction between genetical and environmental factors, metabolic alterations, neuroendocrine and immune systems is supposed to play a role to the pathogenesis of PCOS ( 4 \u2013 6 ). Moreover, physiological inflammation occurs in female reproductive tract during ovulation, menstruation, implantation, and labor at term, the establishment of low-grade chronic inflammation may participate in PCOS etiology ( 7 , 8 ). PCOS patients have permanently elevated serum and ovarian levels of inflammatory markers interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-18, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) compared with normal controls ( 9 \u2013 11 ). The association between inflammatory cytokines and ovarian dysfunction implies that inflammation might be reckoned as the most potent risk factor of PCOS ( 12 ). Further investigating the role of inflammatory mediators in the commencement and development of PCOS could be critical for better understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and developing a potential therapeutic target.  IL-15 is secreted by many cell types, including both immune and nonimmune cells such as T-lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and skeletal muscle cells ( 13 , 14 ). IL-15 has attracted considerable attention for its beneficial effects, including improving lipid and glucose metabolism, suppressing white adipose tissue inflammation, enhancing mitochondrial function, and attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress ( 15 , 16 ). In contrast with beneficial effects of IL-15, IL-15 was also reported to participate in chronic inflammation of adipose tissue leading to obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, which absent in IL-15 KO mice prevented accumulation of fat in the white adipose tissue and promoted lipid utilization via adaptive thermogenesis ( 17 ). Furthermore, serum IL-15 concentrations were higher in overweight subjects, suggesting that adipose tissue depots might be a source of IL-15 ( 18 ). IL-15 was increased in follicular fluid (FF) from women with endometriosis, suggesting that IL-15 may have impaired oocyte quality leading to lower fertilization rates ( 19 ). IL-15 concentration in FF of follicles with immature oocytes were significantly higher than those with mature oocytes, suggesting that IL-15 should be investigated as a possible predictive factor for oocyte maturity ( 20 ). Adverse correlation between FF IL-15 concentration and maturity of oocyte, therefore, we aimed to investigate the pathogenesis role of IL-15 in women with PCOS.  Granulosa cells (GCs) are the predominant somatic cell type of the ovarian follicle and involved in folliculogenesis through proliferation, acquisition of gonadotropic responsiveness, steroidogenesis and production of autocrine/paracrine factors ( 21 ). Increased apoptosis of GCs has been proved in patients with PCOS and PCOS animals, although the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis in GCs have not been fully revealed ( 22 \u2013 24 ). Hyperandrogenism directly induces apoptosis of GCs by stimulating an intrinsic pathway and decreasing the production of follicular growth factors ( 25 \u2013 28 ). Immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 also induced GCs apoptosis during the follicular development in PCOS rats ( 29 ). Although the IL-15 concentration in FF is negatively related to the maturity of oocytes, the effect of IL-15 on the proliferation and apoptosis of GCs remains unknown. The MAPK signaling pathway is one of the important pathways of IL-15. The activation of this signaling pathway affects the proliferation and apoptosis of target cells and the release of inflammatory factors ( 30 , 31 ). And interestingly, phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway is involved in the expression of androgen synthesis related enzymes StAR and CAP17A1 ( 32 , 33 ). We hypothesize that IL-15 will affect the proliferation of granulosa cells and the expression of genes related to androgen synthesis through the above signaling.  Knowledge in the association between FF IL-15 concentration and testosterone in women with PCOS could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of PCOS. this study aimed to detect the FF IL-15 concentration in women with PCOS, examine the association of FF IL-15 concentration with serum testosterone and explore the effect of IL-15 on the biological activities of GCs.    Materials and Methods   Study Subjects and Sample Collection  This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital affiliated Fudan University. Informed written consent was obtained from all the participants. Eligible women who had undergone IVF were recruited from September 2020 to January 2021. PCOS was diagnosed based on the Rotterdam criteria with two of the following: oligo and/or anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology, and clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (in this study, hyperandrogenism was defined as T>51ng/dl\u3001the menstrual cycle exceeds 45 days and the number of small follicles visible on both sides of the ovary under ultrasound is \u226512). The control group included women who seek treatment for tubal infertility or male factors, with normal ovarian reserve (regular menstrual cycles, and normal ovarian morphology) who has normal BMI, the menstrual cycle is 28-35 days and the number of small follicles in a unilateral ovary under ultrasound <10. Women with endometriosis, cancer, or other medical disorders that could affect folliculogenesis were excluded.  FF samples were collected from 3 PCOS patients and 3 controls of the participants for cytokine array analysis. Patients included met all the three items of Rotterdam criteria. The clinical, hormonal characteristics were compared between the two subgroups (  Table\u00a01  ). FF samples from an additional 20 PCOS patients and 15 controls of the participants were collected for ELISA validation of the identified cytokines, and the clinical, hormonal characteristics were presented in  Table\u00a02  . All subjects underwent controlled ovarian stimulation using the standard IVF antagonist stimulation regimen protocol. FF was collected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration, 36 h after the administration of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin. Only clear FF samples with no macroscopic blood contamination were included. After oocyte isolation, the FF samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min to remove pellets. The supernatant was then separated and stored at -80\u00b0C for future use.   Table\u00a01   Clinical information of the participants for cytokine array analysis.

Cytokine and Chemokine Array  A cytokine and chemokine array (Proteome Profiler TM Human XL Cytokine Array Kit, R&D Systems, MN, USA) was used to detect the changes in 102 cytokines and chemokines in follicular fluid from PCOS and non-PCOS patients according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, samples were incubated on the membrane overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rocking shaker. The membranes were washed and incubated with a cocktail of biotinylated dectection antibody, and then the membrane was incubated with Strepatividin-HRP and chemiluminescent detection reagents. The chemiluminescent signal on each membrane was collected using an Amershan Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The intensity (Pixel density) of each spot was quantified using HL Image++ (Western Vision Software, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), and corrected for background intensity and normalized to the membrane\u2019s positive control.    ELISA Validation  The differential abundance of IL-15 was validated by ELISA using FF samples of 20 patients with PCOS and 15 control participants. Concentrations of IL-15 in the FF samples were measured using the commercial human IL-15 ELSIA kits (Multi Science, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.    PCOS Modeling  Three-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Jiesjie laboratory animal co. LTD, Shanghai, China) were maintained in a 12h light/12 h dark cycle with free access to rodent feed and water. All procedures were carried out followed the guidelines provided by the Fudan University Institutional Animal Ethical Committee. Mice were divided randomly into two subgroups: control was subcutaneously implanted with a placebo and PCOS was subcutaneously implanted with 3mg letrozole (LTZ) pellet (Innovative Research of American, Sarasota, FL, USA) for 21 days. At the end of experiment, all mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital sodium. Ovary was dissected out and fixed by paraformaldehyde to paraffin embedding. The animal study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fudan University.    Vaginal Smears  Viginal smears of all mice were collected and for determination of estrous cycle, Giemsa staining was used, and stages of estrous cycle were determined microscopically.    Glucose Tolerance Tests  Mice were fasted for 12 h before the glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and 4h before the insulin tolerance tests (ITT). Glucose levels were measured by tail vein blood sampling using Accu-Chek Performa blood glucose analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). The mice were intraperitoneally injected with D-glucose (2g/kg body weight) for GTT or insulin (1 IU/kg body weight) for ITT after measurement of fasting glucose levels, and tail samples were collected at 15,30,60,90 and 120 min after the IP injection for glucose level detection. And the level of fasting insulin was measured by ELSIA (Multi Science, Hangzhou, China). And HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) index was calculated refer to ( 34 ).    Serum Analysis  Serum testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were measured by corresponding ELISA kits (Sino-UK bio, Beijing, China). Moreover, serum and ovarian tissue homogenates IL-15 concentration was determined through a mice ELISA kit (Multi Science, Hangzhou, China).    Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining  Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for ovary following deparaffinization and rehydration. 5\u03bcm sections were stained using hematoxylin followed by eosin staining and subjected to graded alcohol dehydration. The histopathological analysis of the ovary was evaluated by two independent viewers (Yan Liu, Zhi Li) who were blinded to the group information.    Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of IL-15 was used an immunohistochemical SP kit (Origene, Rockville, MD, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, tissue sections were boiled in antigen retrieval buffer. After cooling, sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution at room temperature for 15 min followed with 10% goat serum as an antigen-blocking buffer for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Sections were then incubated with Rabbit antibody against IL-15 (1:100, Affinity Bioscience, OH,USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humid chamber. HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 30 min and visualized with 3\u20193-diaminobenzideine (DAB). Observations were made using a Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) microscope. The positive staining areas were measured by Image J software (NIH, USA). Immunofluorescence staining was applied by a multiple fluorescent staining kit (Absin Bioscience, Shanghai China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The sections were incubated with primary antibody against IL-15 (1:100), and FSHR (1:500, Service Bio, Wuhan, China). Images were captured using a laser confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Germany).    Cell Culture  KGN (human ovarian granulosa cell tumor) cells were obtained from Shandong University and were cultured with DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Mouse primary granulosa cells (mGCs) were isolated from ovaries of 3 weeks age female C57 mice. Ovaries were dip on ice in Lebovitz\u2019s-15 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. A 25-gauge needle was used to separate surrounding adipose and envelope tissues then puncture the ovary to release the GCs. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 100 rpm for 5 min, resuspended with McCoy\u2019s 5A medium (Sigma Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. To further investigate the involvement of MAPK signaling pathways in IL-15\u2013induced apoptosis and CYP17A1 abundance, the cells were preincubated with or without p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 uM, Selleck Chemicals, USA) ( 35 ), and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 uM, Selleck Chemicals, USA) ( 36 ) for 30 minutes before IL-15 (500pg/ml) treatment.    Cell Counting Kit-8 Assay  Cell viability was determined by cell-counting kit-8 (CCK8) (Selleck, Shanghai, China). KGN cells and mouse primary GCs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u00d7103 cells/well in 100\u03bcl cell suspension. 10\u03bcl CCK-8 reagent was added to each well and then the cells were cultured for 1h at 37\u00b0C. Optical density was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTeck, USA). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate at least.    Apoptosis Assay  The apoptosis level of GCs cells was detected using Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Experiments were performed by a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and analyzed by FlowJo 10.0 software (Tree Star, Ashland, USA).    RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR)  Total RNA was extracted from ovarian tissues and GCs using RNA-Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The RNA concentration of all samples was quantified by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and was reverse transcribed to cDNA by Reverse Transciption kit (Takara, Dalian, China). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed in SYBR Green \u00ae fast qPCR Mix (Takara, Dalian, China) on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA). Results were normalized using \u03b2-actin expression. Primers were designed using Primer-Blast tool by NCBI and present in  Supplementary Table\u00a01  . Relative transcription levels were calculated using 2  -\u0394\u0394CT  methods.    Western Blot  Total protein was extracted using ice-cold radio-immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Cwbio) containing a phosphatase inhibitor and a protease inhibitor cocktail (both from Roche). Protein from each sample was electro-phoresed in a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose blot. After 1 hour of blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the blot was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies against phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185; 1:1000), and total JNK (1:1000), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182; 1:1000), total p38 MAPK (1:1000). On the second day, the blot was washed and then incubated with the respective secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1500) for 1 hour. An enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Millipore) was used to detect the bands with peroxidase activity. A G-Box iChemi Chemiluminescence image capture system (Syngene) was used to visualize the bands. The same blot was also probed with \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000) as internal controls. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (CST, Massachusetts, USA).    GEO Data Analysis  Microarray datasets 155489 and GSE106724 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and collected using the following platforms: GPL20795 (HiSeq X Ten) and GPL21096 (Agilent-062918 Human lncRNA array V4.0).The raw data was converted to a recognizable format by GEO2R ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/ ).    Statistical Analyses  Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 8.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA), and data were presented as the mean\u00b1 the standard error of the mean (SEM)or medians with interquartile ranges. Student\u2019 t test of two independent samples was used for the data of normal distribution, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test of two independent samples was used for the data of non-normal distribution. Pearson\u2019s linear regression was used for correlation analysis to investigate the relationship among IL-15 and serum Testosterone concentration. Spearman\u2019s or pearson\u2019s correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationship among the relative expression of IL-15 or IL-2rg(IL-15r) and CYP17A1 in PCOS patients. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post-hoc test was used for multiple groups. The post hoc statistical power value is expressed as \u201cR\u201d. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   Higher Level of IL-15 in the Follicular Fluid of Patients With PCOS  In order to determine the alteration of cytokine and chemokine in the follicular fluid of PCOS women, we recruited 3 PCOS and 3 non-PCOS patients, whose clinical characteristics are illustrated in  Table\u00a01  . In the PCOS patients, the BMI and serum LH, T and AMH level, and the ratio of LH/FSH were significantly higher, while the age, serum FSH and E2 levels were similar between the two groups. According to the findings of cytokine array, we found that chemokine MPO, IL-1\u03b1, Kallikrein3, IL-15, MCP-1, and IL-8 were significantly increased in PCOS group (  Figure\u00a01A  and  Supplementary Figure\u00a01A  ). As previously reported, IL-15 is a regulator of obesity related pathological changes ( 37 , 38 ), and can modulate insulin sensitivity ( 39 ). Whereas, obesity and insulin resistance (IR) are typical pathological changes in PCOS, we speculated that IL-15 plays an important role in PCOS. Then, the similar results were observed in FF collected from 20 PCOS and 15 non-PCOS patients (  Figure\u00a01C  ), and their clinical characteristics are illustrated in  Table\u00a02  . Non-PCOS patients matched the BMI of PCOS patients, while the LH level of PCOS patients tends to be higher\u3001the FSH level and E2 level tend to be lower and the T level is significantly higher compared with non-PCOS patients, which were also consistent with the clinical endocrine characteristics of PCOS. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis showed that the FF IL-15 concentration was positively correlated with serum T (r=0.2466, P = 0.0024,  Figure\u00a01D  ). And relative expression of IL-15 was positively correlated with CYP17A1 in cumulus granulosa cells of PCOS patients and age-matched control (r=0.7904, P=0.0254,  Figure\u00a01E  ) and relative expression of IL-2rg (IL-15r) was positively correlated with CYP17A1 in cumulus granulosa cells of PCOS patients and non-PCOS women (r=0.5849, P=0.0458,  Figure\u00a01F  ) by using bioinformatics analysis.

Higher Level of IL-15 in PCOS Model Mice  In order to verify the role of IL-15 in the pathogenesis of PCOS, the well-established LTZ-induced PCOS mouse model was confirmed. The mice in the PCOS group were significantly heavier compared with age-matched control mice that had received placebo pellets (  Figure\u00a02A  ). Similar results were observed in the weight of ovary and fat pads in PCOS group (  Supplementary Figure\u00a01C, D  ). PCOS mice had significantly reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (  Figures\u00a02B, C  ). And we tested the fasting blood glucose of the mice and calculated HOMA-IR. The results showed that the PCOS mice had obvious insulin resistance compared with the control group (  Figure\u00a02D  and  Supplementary Figure\u00a01E  ). PCOS mice also displayed an irregular estrous cycle (  Supplementary Figure\u00a01F  ). The levels of serum T, DHEAS and LH were significantly higher in PCOS mice (P<0.05) compared with the control, but there is no significant difference in serum FSH levels (  Figure\u00a02E  and  Supplementary Figure\u00a01G  ). Atresia and cystic dilated follicles were significantly increased and the number of corpora lutea was decreased in the PCOS mice compared with the control mice (  Figures\u00a02F\u2013H  ), indicating similar ovarian dysfunction to the clinical presentation of PCOS.

Consistently, we found that IL-15 mRNA and protein expression were elevated significantly in ovarian of PCOS mice compared with control, while the serum IL-15 level was similar between two groups (  Figures\u00a03A\u2013C  ). Moreover, the IL-15 mRNA expression was elevated significantly in adipose tissues of PCOS mice compared with control, suggesting that IL-15 may play a role in chronic inflammation of adipose (  Figure\u00a03D  ). IHC results confirmed that IL-15 was overexpressed in PCOS mice compared with control (  Figure\u00a03E  ), and colocalized with FSHR, a GCs marker (  Figure\u00a03F  ). This data suggested that IL-15 may be involved in the pathogenic role of GCs in PCOS.   Figure\u00a03   Higher level of IL-15 in PCOS model mice. (A, B) .

Effects of IL-15 on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of KGN Cells  Due to the significant association of IL-15 with the clinic pathological characteristics in PCOS women and the colocalization between IL-15 and GCs in PCOS mice, we examine the effects of IL-15 on GCs growth and apoptosis. Our data showed that IL-15 suppressed proliferation of KGN cells and the intervention of JNK inhibitor SP600125 and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 alleviated this effect of IL-15 (  Figure\u00a04A  ). The results obtained by flow cytometry analysis are also consistent with CCK-8 assay (  Figure\u00a04B  ). These results suggested that IL-15 decreased proliferation, whereas increased apoptosis in GCs.   Figure\u00a04   IL-15 inhibits the proliferation of KGN, promotes its apoptosis and dysfunction. (A) Effects of IL-15 and inhibitors on the cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay(for 48h, P=0.0124, R=7252; for 72h, P=0.0097, R=0.7423; (B) Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis cells (Annexin V+ cells).

Effects of IL-15 on Steroidogenesis and the State of Inflammation in KGN Cells  To delineate the role of IL-15 in GCs steroidogenesis and the state of inflammation, we cultured the KGN cells in the presence or absence of IL-15 with or without inhibitors. Treatment of KGN cells with IL-15 for 4 h resulted in significantly increases the mRNA levels of cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 ( CYP17A1 ), which converts progesterone to 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione (  Figures\u00a04C, D  ). Interestingly, we found that these two inhibitors have inhibitory effects on the increase in CYP17A1 expression induced by IL-15. Consistent to previous studies that IL-15 function as a proinflammatory cytokine ( 40 ), IL-15 significantly increased mRNA level of IL-1b and Ifng and the above two inhibitors have a tendency to reverse this effect (  Figured 4E, F  ). These data suggested that IL-15 might play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS by increasing production of androgen hormones and sustaining inflammation state in GCs, and these effects may be related to the activation of the signaling pathways p38 MAPK and JNK. Therefore, we carried out the detection of these two signaling pathway molecules and their phosphorylation levels on different treated KGN cells by Western Blot. The results of WB showed that IL-15 treatment increased the phosphorylation level of JNK and P38 MAPK in the KGN cell line compared with DMSO alone (  Figure\u00a04G  ).    Effects of IL-15 on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of Mouse Primary Granulosa Cells  IL-15 suppressed proliferation of primary GCs cells at dose dependent manner (  Figures\u00a05A, B  ). In addition, IL-15 promoted apoptosis of primary mGCs at dose dependent manner (  Figure\u00a05C  ).   Figure\u00a05   IL-15 inhibits the proliferation of mGCs and promotes its apoptosis and dysfunction.

Effects of IL-15 on Steroidogenesis and the State of Inflammatory in Mouse Primary Granulosa Cells  Consistent with previous study, IL-15 significantly increased mRNA levels of CYP17A1 , while decreased mRNA levels of CYP19A1 and FSHR (  Figures\u00a05D\u2013G  ). IL-15 also increased proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels of Ifng and Tnfa (  Figures\u00a05H, I  ). The effects of IL-15 on the steroidogenic activity of primary GCs were evaluated. The level of DHEAS and progesterone in the medium secreted from primary GCs for 24 h in the presence of IL-15 were measured. The concentration of DHEAS were significantly increased after incubation of the cells with IL-15 (  Figure\u00a05J  ), while the concentration of progesterone remained unaltered (  Figure\u00a05K  ). These data confirmed the results obtained from the human GCs cell line KGN.     Discussion  Ovarian granulosa cells (GC) are important somatic cells in ovarian tissue which are stimulated by FSH. They secrete insulin-like growth factors and promote the development of follicles. In addition, various aromatase families can promote cholesterol metabolism and secrete synthetic sex hormones, which play an important role in female reproductive health ( 41 ). In this study, we evaluated the effects of IL-15 on GC functions including GC proliferation, expression of inflammatory factors and steroidogenesis, aiming to examine the potential involvement of IL-15 in regulating ovarian follicle function by utilizing the KGN cells and a primary mouse granulosa cells culture model. And we found that IL-15 affects the proliferation and function of GC through p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation.  Chronic inflammation is an important pathogenic factor of PCOS. In the analysis of the cytokine and chemokine array of the patient\u2019s follicular fluid, we found that IL-15 significantly elevated in PCOS group. And except it, we found that MPO, IL-1\u03b1, Kallikrein3, MCP-1, and IL-8 significantly elevated in PCOS group, proving that the ovarian of PCOS patients does have a chronic inflammation state. Previous studies reported that these inflammatory factors are associated with insulin resistance and promoting androgen release ( 42 \u2013 46 ). However, these inflammatory factors except IL-8 have been reported to be elevated only in the serum of PCOS patients before, the results of our follicular fluid provide ideas for studying the relationship between circulatory inflammation and ovarian inflammation in patients with PCOS.  We found that the level of follicular fluid (FF) IL-15 was higher than that in the control mice group, which was consistent with the results of PCOS patients. But the level of IL-15 in serum didn\u2019t significant increase. The results seem to indicate that IL-15 is produced locally in the ovarian tissue, or certain factors may promote the accumulation of IL-15 in the ovarian tissue. By co-localizing mouse granulosa cells and IL-15 immunofluorescence, we found that the position of IL-15 and granulosa cells are highly co-localized, indicating that granulosa cells are the main somatic cells that produce IL-15 in ovarian tissue, but which factors lead to increased IL-15 secretion by ovarian granulosa cells need further research. In addition, we also found that the expression level of IL-15 in adipose tissue was significantly up-regulated in the PCOS model mouse group. Studies have shown that the adipose tissue of patients with metabolic abnormalities such as obesity is in a state of chronic inflammation ( 47 ). The results suggested that the inflammatory reaction occurred not only in the FF but also in the fat tissue of the PCOS.  IL-15 is generally regarded as a T cell growth factor and is belongs to the cytokine receptor \u03b3 chain (\u03b3c) family. It shows a wide range of pleiotropic effects regulating the innate and adaptive immune system, regulates cell differentiation and promoting survival or inducing apoptosis according to the cell environment ( 48 ). But there is no research showing that IL-15 has a direct effect on the apoptosis of somatic cells. The present studies provide new insights into the intracellular signaling cascade by which IL-15 induces GCs apoptosis. Our research showed that IL-15 not only induced Ifng but also Tnfa expression. Both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 promote cell apoptosis. IFN-gamma(IFN-\u03b3) modulates the apoptotic pathway by upregulating apoptosis-related genes and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 induces the excessive apoptosis of IECs and is involved in Crohn\u2019s disease development ( 49 , 50 ). And studies have shown that IFN-\u03b3 can promote the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells ( 51 ). TNF-\u03b1 can induce hepatocyte apoptosis and liver damage ( 52 ). And our study found that IL-15 promoted the increase of mGCs synthesis DHEAS. Study have shown that the increase of androgens inhibits the proliferation of granulosa cells ( 53 ), so the pro-apoptotic effect of IL-15 on ovarian granulosa cells may be indirectly achieved by promoting the androgen and inflammation state of follicular fluid microenvironment. Follicular atresia in PCOS patients is associated with increased granulosa cell apoptosis ( 54 ). Our study revealed that high doses of IL-15 inhibited the proliferation of GCs, indicating that the increase in granuloma cells apoptosis observed under pathological conditions (such as PCOS) may be caused by IL-15 or the immune microenvironmental changes caused by IL-15 stimulation. Therefore, based on these findings, we believe that IL-15 participates in the follicular atresia of PCOS by promoting the apoptosis of granulosa cells.  Elevated androgen is an important pathological manifestation of PCOS. We found that treatment of IL-15 increases the expression of CYP17A1 in granulosa cells. CYP17A1 is a critically important enzyme in humans that catalyzes the formation of androgens. It catalyzes the 17\u03b1-hydroxylation of pregnenolone to 17\u03b1-OH pregnenolone. Subsequently, through its C17,20 lyase activity, it can further convert 17\u03b1-OH pregnenolone to the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone, which is the precursor of androstenedione, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( 55 ). The increase in DHEAS of the culture supernatant of mGCs treated with IL-15 also indicates that IL-15 promotes the secretion of androgens from granulosa cells. IL-15 forms a complex with receptors IL-2R\u03b2 and \u03b3 chain (IL-2R\u03b3) through IL-15R\u03b1, and completes the process of signal transduction to play immune and other functions ( 56 ). Our analysis of the database showed that the expression of IL-15, IL-2rg and CYP17A1 in granulosa cells of PCOS patients were positively correlated, indicating that IL-15 was involved in androgen synthesis. And there is a randomized controlled trial using BNZ-1, a selective and simultaneous inhibitor of cytokines IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15, for the treatment of hyperandrogen-induced hair loss ( 57 ).It shows that factors that inhibit IL-15 such as BNZ-1 have a role in the treatment of PCOS hyperandrogenism.  CYP19A1 is considered to be an important marker in the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome. The study reported that compared with healthy controls, the aromatase gene expression in PCOS follicles before ovulation and the subsequent estradiol production decreased ( 58 ). And it can convert androgen into estrogen ( 59 ). FSHR plays an important role in synthesizing estrogen and stimulating follicular development ( 60 , 61 ). IL-15 treatment reduced the expression of CYP19A1 , and FSHR both in mGCs. Those all indicated that IL-15 can affect follicle development by influence hormone synthesis related enzymes and participate in the follicular atresia of PCOS.  We found that IL-15 promoted the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK in KGN cells, and the addition of corresponding inhibitors would reverse the effects of IL-15 on the proliferation inhibition and functional genes and expression of pro-inflammatory factors in KGN cell lines. It reminds us that IL-15 may play a role through these two signaling pathways. This needs to be further verified in mGCs.  For the first time, we reported that IL-15 decreased KGN cells and mGCs proliferation as well as key genes for follicular development such as CYP19A1 and FSHR . IL-15 also up-regulated the expression of CYP17A1, the key steroidogenic-related genes in androstenedione secretion. In addition, IL-15 can increase the expression of pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 , Tnfa and Ifng of granulosa cells, and these pro-inflammatory factors have been reported to be related to the metabolism of PCOS and the abnormal reproductive phenotype, and promote the chronicity of the microenvironment around the follicle. And this effect is through p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation. The present study provides new evidence for IL-15-dependent regulation of proliferation and steroidogenesis in GCs that may influence follicle development. It is now convincingly suggested that IL-15 may serve as a critical regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation and steroidogenesis in the KGN and mGCs of ovarian preantral follicle. But additional research is needed to understand the mechanism of action of IL-15 in granulosa cells, as well as its exact role in follicle development. The current clinical treatment and efficacy evaluation of PCOS, due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria, patients often have repeated symptoms. IL-15, as a pro-inflammatory factor, participates in the pathogenic process of PCOS, showing the potential in evaluation of the diagnosis and treatment effect of PCOS. However, this study only analyzed the signal pathways of the human KGN cell line, did not study mGCs and did not conduct IL-15 intervention experiments and rescue experiments in vivo . The sample size of patients used to detect IL-15 is relatively small. We will continue to improve in the future.  Further efforts are needed to demonstrate a connection between inflammatory factors and PCOS pathogenesis. Research on which signaling pathway is used by IL-15 to promote the secretion of androgens by granulosa cells needs to be further explored. By verifying the involvement of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of PCOS, new therapy may be developed for PCOS treatment, such as blocking therapeutic targets including inflammatory factors and signaling pathways.
