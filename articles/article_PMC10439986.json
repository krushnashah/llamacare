    "abstract": "One of the most common endocrine disorders of reproductive age women is polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS). Women with PCOS are at risk for infertility, endometrial cancer, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular disease.\nAwareness of the signs and symptoms of PCOS can be effective in diagnosing early stage PCOS and promoting\nquality of life (QoL). This study assesses the awareness of PCOS in schoolgirls and their mothers. This cross-sectional study was carried out on 1580 high school girls and 480 of their mothers\nin Tehran (capital of Iran) in 2017 and 2018. We used the stratified sampling method and divided Tehran into five\ngeographic regions: north, south, east, west, and central. Schools were randomly selected from each of these regions.\nStudents and their mothers separately answered a self-administered questionnaire that pertained to their knowledge\nof PCOS. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS, version 22 (Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and R version 3.2.1. Students had an average age of 16.97 \u00b1 0.84 years and their mothers\u2019 average age was 45.19 \u00b1 5.03 years.\nThe average body mass index (BMI) of the students was 22.01 \u00b1 5.54 kg/m The level of PCOS awareness in Iranian women is insufficient and this may affect their QoL. Therefore,\nthe health authorities should implement educational programs to challenge women\u2019s incorrect beliefs about PCOS and\nincrease their awareness of this disease.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most\ncommon and complex endocrine disorders that affects\n5-10% of reproductive-aged women (1). The range of\nPCOS prevalence is 8 to 13% and depends on the type\nof diagnostic criteria, race, and ethnicity of the studied\npopulation (2). For instance, the prevalence of PCOS in\nthe United States ranges from 5 to 7% (3); however, it is\nat least 2.2% in China (4) and as high as 14.1% in Iran (5).\nThe results of a study conducted in the United Kingdom\nindicated that women in South Asia were significantly more likely to hyperandrogenic symptoms in comparison with\nCaucasian women (6). These differences in phenotypes\nhave been mentioned in other populations, including\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics (7, 8). Differences in\nthe reported prevalence of PCOS are probably be due to\ndifferences in diagnostic criteria (9). For instance, Tehrani\net al. (10) have reported a prevalence of PCOS in women\nages 18-45 years of 7.1% according to National Institutes\nof Health (NIH) criteria, 11.7% by Androgen Excess\nSociety (AES) criteria, and 14.6% according to Rotterdam\ncriteria. Sayehmiri et al. (11) reported a prevalence of\nPCOS among 10-54 years old females of 6.8% (NIH),\n19.5% (Rotterdam), and 41.4% (ultrasound) criteria. In\naddition, the prevalence of PCOS may vary according to\nage. Koivunen et al. (12) reported a higher prevalence\nof PCOS in young women compared to women over 35\nyears of age. PCOS seems to have a genetic source that is\naffected by environmental factors of eating habits, lifestyle,\nand social status. It is characterised by a wide range of\nsigns and symptoms that are associated with dysfunction\nin the reproductive organs, endocrine functions, and\nmetabolic systems (13, 14). The signs and symptoms of\nPCOS in women are painful and uncomfortable. Barnard\net al. (13) have reported that women with PCOS had\npoor quality of life (QoL), high levels of depression,\nemotional disturbance, obesity, infertility, acne, menstrual\nsymptoms, and hirsutism. Also, PCOS is a leading cause\nof anovulatory infertility, a risk factor for endometrial\ndysfunction and uterine cancer, which is a serious lifelong\nhealth concern (15, 16). Therefore, awareness of the signs,\nsymptoms, and complications of early stage PCOS could\nbe of tremendous importance in improving QoL in these\nwomen (1).  Sunanda and Nayak (17) reported that, in recent years,\nthe number of PCOS patients increased by 30% in India.\nLack of knowledge and lifestyle changes among the\nwomen appeared to be two important factors that led to\nincreased numbers of PCOS patients. Hajivandi et al. (18)\nreported decreased consumption of healthy foods (e.g.,\nfibre, meat, beans, fish, seafood, and dairy products)\namong adolescent girls with PCOS. The results of studies\nindicate that weight loss and lifestyle modification are two,\ninitially important steps for treatment of PCOS (19-21).\nThe actual cause of PCOS is unclear and symptoms vary\nfrom case to case (22). PCOS is caused by an imbalance\nof female sex hormones, which may lead to changes in\nthe menstrual cycle, multiple cysts in the ovaries, failure\nto conceive, and other health issues (17). Symptoms\nof PCOS begin after onset of the menstrual cycle in\nwomen. The most common symptom is irregularity in\nthe menstrual cycle along with symptoms of obesity,\nmenstrual abnormalities (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea,\nand other menstrual irregularities), hirsutism, acne, sleep\napnoea, depression, and infertility (23).  Diagnosis of the early symptoms of PCOS is possible\nin individuals with late puberty and early adolescence,\nboth of which are commonly correlated with lifestyle\nand environmental changes. Early diagnosis of PCOS is\nnecessary for timely intervention in order to reduce both\nthe initial and chronic complications of PCOS (24).  Obesity and insulin resistance are important risk factors\nof metabolic syndrome in PCOS patients. The high risks\nassociated with such metabolic disorders call for rapid and\ntimely identification of PCOS. In this regard, the first step\nis to increase women\u2019s awareness of PCOS (25) because\nan accurate diagnosis can improve QoL in these women\n(26). Awareness of PCOS symptoms is of great importance\nfor both treatment and prevention of complications (27).\nHaq et al. (28) have reported that although the prevalence\nof signs and symptoms of PCOS is increasing, there is\nstill a substantial lack of awareness of the symptoms\namong females. According to Rahmanpour et al. (25),\nawareness of women with PCOS in terms of symptoms,\ncomplications (obesity, insulin resistance, infertility,\netc.) and ways to prevent PCOS progression that include\nlifestyle changes and decreased consumption of fast foods\ncan play an important role in the future.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto evaluate the level of awareness towards PCOS\namong high school girls and their mothers in Iran. The\nresults of this study can help to change the approach\nof the education system in Iran. Therefore, educating\nhigh school girls about the symptoms, risk factors,\nand prevention of diseases (such as PCOS) can be a\nsignificant help in improving women\u2019s community\nhealth in the future.    Materials and Methods  This was a cross-sectional study performed on 1580\nschoolgirls who attended randomly chosen schools from\n19 school districts in Tehran (capital of Iran) and 480 of\ntheir mothers. The study was conducted in 2017 and 2018.\nOf note, the school principals of these schools invited all\nmothers to participate in a meeting, but only 480 of them\nattended.  The Ethical Committee of Royan Institute, Tehran\nIran (IR.ACECR.ROYAN.REC.1396.45) approved\nthis study. The study aim and data confidentiality were\nclearly explained for all participants along with ethical\nissues, which were written above the questionnaires.\nEach schoolgirl and her mother who wished to participate\nwere included in this study. Each completed questionnaire\nwas considered to be that participant\u2019s written informed\nconsent.  A review of available sources and texts was\nconducted by researchers on different sites and no\nsimilar questionnaire was located. Therefore, in order\nto achieve the main goal of the study, we designed this\nquestionnaire. Initially, similar articles about PCOS were\nextracted by searching various databases and locating the\navailable sources and texts. This was a knowledge-based\nquestionnaire; therefore, content validity was confirmed\nvia thorough review and revision by 15 experts and\nspecialists (obstetricians and gynaecologists, midwives\nand nurses). Face validity was also used for the spoken\nitems in the questionnaire. The designed questionnaire\nincluded ten positive and negative questions about\nPCOS. Participants who answered more than half of\nthese questions were considered to \u201chave knowledge\u201d.\nDemographic and general information questions that\nincluded region of school and grade, age, weight, height,\nbirth order, type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean\nsection), nutrition in infancy (breast milk, powdered\nmilk, or both) were included. The mother\u2019s questionnaire\nincluded demographic information that pertained to age, birth order, type of delivery, nutrition in infancy,\noccupation, and education, etc\u2026 A yes/no general\nquestion about self-perception of PCOS awareness was\nalso included.  Any clinical or laboratory diagnostic methods were not\nincluded in this study.  We used a stratified sampling method to divide Tehran\ninto five geographic regions: north, south, east, west, and\ncentral, from which the schools were randomly selected.\nIn the next step, with the coordination of the school\nprincipals, we conducted a conference entitled \"Awareness\nof PCOS for Girls and Their Mothers\". Students and their\nmothers answered a self-administered questionnaire of\ntheir knowledge about PCOS prior to the conference.  Based on this method, estimating the sample size,\n95% confidence level, 0.025 (two-way) confidence\ninterval, and proportional probabilities of the three-stage\nclustering method were used. In the first stage, with equal\nprobability, regions and schools were randomly selected\nwith an equal probability within the clusters. Finally,\nwe selected 40 students from each school. Due to the\nstructure of the data collection and the random number\nof participants in the third stage of the surveys, we\nselected the minimum sample size available to decrease\nthe possibility of insufficiency of the sample at this stage\n(Table S1, See supplementary Online Information at www.ijfs.ir ).   Statistical analysis  The descriptive characteristics of the students and\ntheir mothers are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation\nor frequency (percentage). The McNemar test was\nperformed to estimate the relation between mothers and\ndaughters\u2019 knowledge about PCOS. The Chi-square test\nof independence or Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to assess\nthe association of the PCOS categorical variables. Type I\nerror was considered to be 0.05. Statistical analyses were\nconducted using SPSS, version 22 (Inc. Chicago, IL,\nUSA) and R version 3.2.1.     Results  School girls had a mean age and body mass index\n(BMI) of 16.97 \u00b1 0.84 years and 22.01 \u00b1 5.54 kg/m 2 ,\nrespectively. Most students were from the east region\n(29.4%) and most were the first child in their family\n(52.4%). A total of 71% were born by caesarean section\nand 63.8% were completely breastfed during their\nchildhood. Table 1 lists the demographic characteristics\nof the students.  Table 2 lists the demographic characteristics of the\nmothers. The mothers had an average age of 45.19 \u00b1\n5.03 years, 62.7% of them were born by vaginal delivery,\nand 71.9% were completely breastfed. The majority of\nmothers who were housewives with a diploma degree\nhad more information about PCOS compared to the other\nmothers.

There was a\nhistory of PCOS in their mothers (n=5, 10.41%) and\nsisters (n=6, 12.5%). The awareness rate of PCOS among\nmothers was 27% (n=128).  In terms of self-perception of awareness, 6.45% (n=102)\nof the students considered themselves to have knowledge\nof PCOS compared to 44.58% (n=214) of the mothers.  Sources of information about PCOS for schoolgirls\nincluded their mothers (31.25%), the Internet (25%),\nhealth educators and radio /television (each one 18.75%),\ntheir friends and study about PCOS (each one 14.58%).  Table 3 shows a significant positive relation between\nawareness of the schoolgirls about PCOS and their\nmothers\u2019 knowledge about PCOS (P<0.001).

The result of our study showed that awareness of PCOS\nin mothers and their daughters was significantly related\nto the level of mothers\u2019 education (P=0.002). In addition,\nPCOS awareness among mothers was significantly related\nto their educational level (P<0.001, Table 4).  We observed a significant correlation between mothers\u2019\noccupations and their awareness of PCOS (P=0.01).\nHowever, there was no correlation between mothers\u2019\noccupations and their daughters\u2019 awareness of PCOS\n(P=0.06, Table 5).

Our results showed that the level of awareness towards\nPCOS among students was significantly related to two\nvariables: maternal delivery type (P=0.02) and district\nof residence (P=0.01). In this regard, students who were\ndelivered by caesarean section and lived in the east\nregion had more information of PCOS compared to other\nstudents. Table 6 shows that mothers who had higher\nawareness of PCOS compared to the other participants\nhad the following characteristics: first child (P<0.001),\nage range: 42\u201345 years (P=0.01), nutrition in infancy\n(P<0.001), and residence in the central region of the\ncapital (P=0.01).    Discussion  The first step in managing PCOS is awareness and\naccurate diagnosis, which can both improve QoL in\na patient (1). This study was conducted to assess the\nknowledge of PCOS among schoolgirls and their mothers.\nThe results of our study showed that awareness of PCOS\nin schoolgirls and their mothers was 3.2% (n=48) and\n27% (n=148), respectively. Among them, 22.91% (n=11)\nof girls and 10.41 % (n=5) of mothers were diagnosed\nwith PCOS.  Gul et al. (29) reported that only 20 out of 177 (11.3%)\nPakistani women who participated in their study had\ninadequate information about PCOS, and 11 participants\nhad degrees in the Medical Sciences. In another study\nin Pakistan, Haq et al. (28) reported that 72.5% of the\nwomen were unaware of PCOS. Awareness of PCOS in\nSaudi women was 56.7% of which 15.3% of these women\nhad PCOS (27). Additionally, Shammi (26) showed that\n66.94% of female students had the least knowledge and\n2.20% had high awareness of PCOS, 30.85% had no\nknowledge of PCOS, and 22.25% were diagnosed with\nPCOS. Upadhye and Shembekar (1) conducted a study\nin India and reported that 72% of girls (medical students)\nhad knowledge of PCOS, and 6% had PCOS. The high\nlevel of awareness of girls in their study might be due to\ntheir medical school education.  In a study conducted by Alessa et al. (27), 72.9% of\nfemales were university graduates and 1.2% had only\nprimary school education. They found that a significantly\ngreater level of awareness of PCOS among women\nwith higher education levels; most of the women with\nknowledge of PCOS had a history of medical and\nhealth education. Aminrad et al. (30) reported that an\nincrease in age and level of education resulted in an\nincrease in awareness and attitude of individuals towards\nenvironmental issues. In our study, the average age of\nhigh school girls was 16.97 \u00b1 0.84 years. Upadhye and\nShembekar (1) reported that 62.5% of participants were\nyoung adults (20-24 years) and 37.5% were adolescents\n(18-19 years); only 28% were unaware of PCOS. Sills et\nal. (31) found that participants in the age group of 26-34\nyears had significantly higher information about PCOS\nthan others. Alessa et al. (27) reported a relatively high\nawareness level (56.7%) towards PCOS among Saudi\nwomen (18-50 years). Due to less experience and study\nlevels among younger age groups, they might receive less\ninformation about PCOS than older age groups; however,\nStrong (32) believes that people who live longer will\nhave a better chance of learning. In other words, as young\ngirls become older, their level of awareness and curiosity\nincrease with respect to female-related illnesses, which\ncould be due to the exposure of students, friends, and\nrelatives to relative illnesses and symptoms.  In the present study, the most common source of\ninformation for girls was from their mothers (31.25%),\nfollowed by the Internet (25%), health educators and radio\n/television (each one 18.75%), and their friends and study\nabout PCOS (each one 14.58%). Alessa and colleagues\n(27) reported that among women who had knowledge of\nPCOS, 15.3% had PCOS and they received information\nabout their disease from the Internet (21.3%), other patients\n(10.4%), doctors (10.8%), and books (3.1%). In another\nstudy, 82.02% of the students with PCOS had access to\ninformation via doctors (17.98%), media (11.24%), the\nInternet, and physiotherapists (1.1%) (26). Sills et al.\n(31) reported that women with PCOS, regardless of age,\nreceived more information on PCOS from their doctors.\nUpadhye and Shembekar (1) indicated that 33% of young\ngirls and teenagers received their information about\nPCOS from teachers, friends (19%), physicians (11.5%),\nnewspapers (3.5%), and the Internet (5%).  The results of our study showed that schoolgirls who\nattended high schools in east Tehran had the highest\nknowledge about PCOS and students in the south had\nthe least awareness of PCOS. The east parts of Tehran\nappear to be some of the older, original regions, and had\nless migration than the other regions. Also, the quality of\neducation in this area is higher than the south of Tehran,\nwith a more native and marginal tissue. Shokouhi (33)\nbelieves that one of the consequences of uncontrolled\nmigration to large cities, such as Tehran, is marginalization\nthat has expanded over the past few decades.  Mothers\u2019 knowledge about PCOS significantly affects\nthe awareness of their daughters. In addition, mothers\nwho are the first-born in a family have more awareness of\nPCOS. It seems that mothers are more sensitive and spend\nmore time to train and educate their first-born children.\nMothers usually obtain their information through\nconsultation with friends, doctors, radio and television,\nreading books, and the Internet. If a mother has PCOS, she\ncan inform her daughter of its symptoms and side effects.\nTherefore, this awareness can lead to a faster diagnosis\nand prevention of complications.  Abdel Azim Mohamed (34) concluded that educating\nwoman about PCOS could play a significant role in\nincreasing their awareness. They reported that prior to\nthe establishment of educational sessions, most students\n(84.4%) had poor knowledge about PCOS. After the\neducational sessions, there was an increase in the\nknowledge score of PCOS. Nivetha and Suganya (24)\nreported that educating women about all aspects of PCOS\nwould increase community knowledge about the impact of PCOS on women and their loved ones. Jakhar et al.\n(35) believes that screening of PCOS in schools/colleges/\nuniversities is extremely important and awareness of\nPCOS could enhance a woman\u2019s lifestyle and her future\nreproductive life.  The limitations of our study include the lack of suitable\ncooperation by schools, students, and their mothers with\nresearchers. The allotted time for students and mothers\nto complete the questionnaires was 8 am to 2 pm that\nmajority of mothers were housewives. The exclusion of\ndiagnostic analysis; and the criterion for PCOS was selfreported\n(mother or student).    Conclusion  The level of PCOS awareness in Iranian women is\ninsufficient and this affects their QoL. Adolescent girls\nshould receive knowledge about PCOS because it can\naffect their health and future pregnancies since PCOS\nis associated with foetal and maternal complications. A\nmother\u2019s awareness about PCOS can be a tremendous\nassistance to her daughter\u2019s knowledge of PCOS.    Supplementary PDF",
