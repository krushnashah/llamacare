    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the most common endocrine system disorders,\naffects women during their reproductive age ( McCartney & Marshall, 2016 ). This disease was described in 1935 by\nStein and Leventhal, that is why it is also named Stein-Leventhal syndrome ( Leventhal, 1958 ). In this disease,\napproximately 10 small cysts with diameters from 2 to 8 mm are formed in one or both\novaries; or the ovarian volume in at least one ovary is more than 10 ml ( Jonard et al ., 2003 ). In\nhealthy women, immature oocytes are matured under the effect of Follicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH) and ovulation, as well as final maturation is induced by Luteinizing\nHormone (LH). While, in women with PCOS, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is\nincreased, and subsequently LH is promoted in comparison with FSH in circulation\n( Banaszewska et al .,\n2003 ).  Since androgen hormones are greatly produced in PCOS, the expression of involved\ngenes is changed in the production of endogenous hormones. One of these genes is the\nCytochrome P450-C17 gene ( Cyp17 ), which encodes the cytochrome P40\nenzyme. It is involved in the production of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and\n17-hydroxyprogesterone from pregnenolone and progesterone, respectively ( Gilep et al. , 2011 ). Ptgs2 or Cox2 gene are important in ovulation.\nThey are involved in the production of prostaglandin as an inflammatory dilator in\nthe ovary ( Fox et al .,\n2019 ).  Multiple studies have indicated that oxidative stress, a mismatch between oxidation\nand antioxidation, is one of the causes of PCOS and PCOS-related symptoms, such as\ninsulin resistance, hyperandrogenic and chronic inflammation ( Zuo et al ., 2016 ). In view of the fact that\nepidemiological findings showed a high prevalence of PCOS worldwide ( Yildiz et al ., 2012 ), PCOS\nincreases the risk of many diseases, such as infertility ( Hart, 2008 ), cancer ( Balen,\n2001 ), type II diabetes mellitus ( Elting et al ., 2001 ), obesity ( Elting et al ., 2001 ) and heart disease ( Dokras, 2013 ) in these women. Thus, this\ndisease affects all aspects of a woman\u2019s mental and physical health, and\nsubsequently it will have negative mental and economic impacts on family health.  Regarding the side effects of chemical drugs on PCOS treatment, identification and\nproduction of alternative drugs are conducive to improve PCOS and its symptoms.\nMedicinal plants were applied for treating a high range of gynecological diseases,\nincluding menopausal and menstrual symptoms. Mentha arvensis is a\nspecies of the Lamiaceae family of plants, which can grow in temperate wet climates\nand even in humid places with steppe climates ( Ferreira et al ., 2012 ). Various species of the\nLamiaceae family have been used to treat various women\u2019s health problems, like\ndysmenorrhea ( Bafor et al .,\n2021 ; Uritu et al .,\n2018 ), amenorrhea ( Elahi et\nal ., 2016 ; Moini Jazani et al ., 2018 ) and PCOS ( Abasian et al ., 2018 ; Goswami et al ., 2012 ). But no study has been\nconducted to investigate the effects of M. arvensis on PCOS.\nRegarding the high prevalence of PCOS and complications, and failure of chemical\ntreatments in these patients, we investigated the impact of M.\narvensis hydroalcoholic extract on LH and FSH hormones in blood, as\nwell as the expression of Cyp17 and Ptgs2 genes\nand antioxidant capacity of ovary in a PCOS rat model.    MATERIALS AND METHODS   Plant collection and extraction  For this experimental study, M. arvensis was collected from the\nprovince ofFars, Iran. It was identified by a botanist; it was given a voucher\nnumber and it was deposited in the Shiraz School of Pharmacy Herbarium.  The plant was dried with all its organs, and it was grinded. To provide\nhydroethanolic extract, 100 g of dried plant was soaked in 700 ml 80% ethanol\nand the mixture was shaken for 48 hours, and it was repeated twice. The solution\nwas filtered and the extracts were condensed by a rotary device at 40-50\u00b0C for\ntwo days. The provided powder was stored at 4\u00b0C until the assays were\nperformed.    Animals  Thirty female wistar rats (6-7 weeks old), weighting 195\u00b14.1 were provided\nby the Pasture Iran institute animal house. The animals were randomly divided\ninto five groups of six rats each, including a healthy control group, untreated\nPCOS group (PCOS), PCOS rats treated with 50 mg/kg (T50 mg/kg), 100 mg/kg (T100\nmg/kg) and 200 mg/kg (T200 mg/kg) hydroalcoholic extract of M.\narvensis . The rats were maintained into 23\u00b13\u00b0C with free\naccess to food and water in 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles.  Furthermore, the treatment groups of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of extract powder\nmixed with water for 4 weeks were fed by gavage at a volume of 0.5 ml. The\nweight of all rats was measured before the treatment, after PCOS induction and\nthe last day of experiment. All animal care and procedures in this study were\napproved by the Ethics committee of the Islamic Azad University, Shahr-e-Qods\nBranch (No. IAUSG 1926).    Polycystic ovary syndrome rat model  Rats in the PCOS group, were daily administered 250 mg/kg of testosterone\nenanthate (Aburaihan Pharmaceutical Co., Iran) by subcutaneous injection in the\nneck for 3 weeks. After that, ovarian tissue and the number of follicles were\nexamined to confirm the PCOS induction.    Measurement of LH and FSH hormone levels  After four weeks of M. arvensis extract treatment, blood samples\nwere harvested from the rats\u2019 hearts. To prepare the serum, blood samples were\ncentrifuged at 2500rpm for 10 minutes and levels of LH and FSH hormones (ZellBio\nGmbH, Germany) were assessed using the ELISA technique, based on instructions\nfrom the manufacturer, by ELISA Reader at a wavelength of 450nm.    Ovarian morphology  In the end of the experiment, the ovaries of all groups were stained for\nhistological assessment by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Briefly, after\ndissecting the ovaries, the samples were fixed in formaldehyde. Then, the\nroutine paraffin embedding was done. The ovary tissues were cut using a rotary\nmicrotome at a thickness of 5 \u00b5m. The samples were stained with H&E\nand examined under a light microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE E200, Japan).    Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in ovarian tissues  The ovaries were removed and homogenized in PBS buffer, and then centrifuged at\n12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After that, the supernatant was transferred\ninto a new tube and TAC was measured using the Kiazist TAC kit (Kiazist, Iran)\naccording to instructions from the manufacturer. Absorbance was read at 450 nm\nwavelength.    The assessment of Cyp17 and Ptgs2 gene\nexpression  Real time RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of Cyp17 and Ptgs2 ( Cox2 ) genes in ovarian tissue\nsamples. To extract RNA, we used the RiboEX kit (GeneAll, Seoul, South Korea),\naccording to instructions of manufacturer. A nanodrop device was used to\ndetermine the amount and purity of the extracted RNA. In the next step, cDNA was\nsynthesized using a HyperScript\u2122 first strand cDNA synthesis kit.\nReal-time RT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus\u2122\n(Applied Biosystems\u2122, Foster City, CA, USA) in a final volume of 25\n\u00b5L containing of 1 \u00b5l of the cDNA template, 12.5 \u00b5L of\nRealQ Plus 2x Master Mix Green (Amplicon, Denmark), and 1 \u00b5L (10\npmol/\u00b5l) of each specific primer ( Table\n1 ). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a reference\ngene. The samples were analyzed using the 2 -\u2206\u2206Ct method.

Tukey\u2019s multiple\ncomparison was used as a posthoc to compare the groups. All results were\npresented as mean \u00b1 standard error (mean\u00b1SEM). We considered a\nsignificance level of 0.05. we used five replicates per group for each\nassessment.     RESULTS   Body weight  The rats\u2019 weights were measured before starting the study, after creating the\nPCOS model and on the last day of the study ( Table 2 ). In the last day of the experiment, the body weight in the\nPCOS group was higher than among controls and the T50, T100 and T200 groups\n( p <0.05). After 21 days of treatment with hydroalcoholic\nextract of M. arvensis , body weight of rats in the T50, T100\nand T200 groups reached the levels of the control group.

LH and FSH levels in untreated\nPCOS and T50 groups significantly increased in comparison with the healthy\ncontrols, the T100 and T200 groups ( p <0.01). It was also\nfound that the levels of LH and FSH in the PCOS group were higher than theT50\ngroup ( p <0.01). On the other hand, levels of LH and FSH\nhormones in the T100 and T200 groups reached the values of the control group\n( Fig. 1 ).   Figure 1 The changes in LH and FSH hormones in the rat groups: LH and FSH\nhormones (IU/mL) in the healthy control group, untreated PCOS group\n(PCOS), treated groups with 50 mg (T50), 100 mg (T100) and 200 mg\n(T200) hydroalcoholic extract of M. arvensis . *\nShows a significant difference with the control group at p <0.001, and # Shows a significant\ndifference vis-\u00e0-vis the PCOS group at p <0.01.      Ovarian morphology  Ovarian tissues of controls, PCOS and treated group (with 200 mg/kg\nhydroalcoholic extract of M. arvensis ) were assessed using\nhematoxylin and eosin staining ( Fig. 2 )\nwith a magnification of 400s. As indicated in Fig.\n2 in the control group, healthy follicles were visible with black\narrows and in the PCOS group cysts were indicated with red arrows. In the T200\ngroup, healthy follicles are represented by a black arrow.

Red\narrows show the cysts in the PCOS group (middle image), and the\nblack arrows represent a healthy follicle in the ovaries of control\ngroup (left image) and T200 group (right image) animals.      Number of follicles  We counted the number of follicles in the ovaries from three rats of each group.\nResults showed that the number of ovarian follicles in the PCOS group\n(5\u00b11.3) was lower than that in healthy rats (23\u00b11.4. p <0.01). This number was increased in PCOS rats treated\nwith M. arvensis hydroalcoholic extract\n( p <0.01); and the highest number of follicles was observed\nin the T200 group (21\u00b12.6), which was not significantly different from\nthe number of follicles among healthy controls Table 3 .

DISCUSSION  PCOS is a common metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age, which affects all\naspects of a woman\u2019s life. The criteria for diagnosis of this disease are LH and FSH\nhormone level as well as ovarian histological changes and weight gain of patients.\nIn this study, we approved creating a rat model using features like rat weight, LH\nand FSH hormones and ovarian tissue changes.  In the present study we found that hydroalcoholic extract of M.\narvensis in all concentrations inhibited weight gain in the PCOS rats;\nalthough the concentration of 200 mg/kg had the highest impact on body weight\nimprovement. Alizadeh et al . (2020) evaluated the effects of\nhydroalcoholic extract of Stachys sylvatica from Lamiacea family on\nthe inhibition of obesity in the PCOS rat model. Their study indicated that the\nextract improved obesity in PCOS rats.  In healthy women, the level of the two hormones FSH and LH were almost the same\n( Swaroop et al ., 2015 );\nbut in PCOS women the LH level was increased. The results of our study showed an\nincrease in LH in the PCOS group. The groups treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg of\nhydroalcoholic extract of M. arvensis significantly decreased the\nLH and FSH to their levels in healthy rats. Mentha species, like M.\narvensis have high amounts of phenolic compounds as secondary\nmetabolites ( Benabdallah et al .,\n2016 ; Gharib & da Silva,\n2013 ), and the most significant phenolic compounds in these species are\nflavonoids ( Haj-Husein et al .,\n2016 ). Some flavonoids can activate GABA by binding to its receptor\n( Ciechanowska et al .,\n2009 ). Gonadotropins stimulate the secretion of LH and FSH hormones from\nthe pituitary gland. On the other hand, gonadotropin secretion is prevented by GABA\nneurotransmitter ( Ciechanowska et\nal ., 2009 ). Thus, by binding the flavonoids to GABA receptors,\nGABA prevents the GnRH secretion and subsequently, the level of LH secretion will be\nreduced ( Herbison & Dyer, 1991 ). At\nvariance with those results, Alizadeh et al . (2020) study indicated\nthat Stachys sylvatica hydroalcoholic extract significantly reduced\nthe levels of FSH and LH in treated rats. Also, Grant\u2019s (2010) study showed that spearmint (Lamiacea family)\nsignificantly increased LH and FSH in women with PCOS. The results of another study\nindicated that Marjoram (Lamiacea family) as tea, had no change in the level of LH\nhormone in women with PCOS ( Haj-Husein et\nal ., 2016 ). These differences in the studies could be\nattributed to variances in the PCOS induction drug, the investigated subject, and\nthe type of plant extract used.  This study showed a significant increase in the number of cystic follicles in the\nPCOS group in comparison with the healthy control group. The number of ovarian cysts\nwas reduced after treatment with M. arvensis hydroalcoholic\nextract. These findings are consistent with the results of some other species of\nLamiacea family and other herbal extracts in the treatment of PCOS ( Alizadeh et al ., 2020 ; Amoura et al ., 2015 ; Sadeghi Ataabadi et al .,\n2017 ).  Our findings indicated an important increase in the antioxidant capacity of the ovary\nof PCOS rats treated with M. arvensis hydroalcoholic extract. The\nresearch of Sadeghi Ataabadi et al . (2017) indicated that Mentha spicata extract in PCOS rats decreased ovarian cysts and\nincreased ovarian antioxidant capacity. Increasing oxidative stress by an imbalance\nbetween antioxidants and oxidants, which can disrupt the folliculogenesis in PCOS\npatients and consumption of antioxidant substances can be efficient in the treatment\nof PCOS ( Zhang et al .,\n2008 ). Multiple studies showed that the increase in antioxidant capacity of\nMentha species such as arvensis is due to its phenolic compounds\n( Benabdallah et al .,\n2016 ; Dar et al .,\n2014 ).  In this study, the expression of Cyp17 in ovarian tissue of PCOS\nrats was considerably high. In agreement with this finding, many studies revealed\nthat the expression of Cyp17 in PCOS ovarian tissue of humans and\nrats was greatly expressed compared to healthy ovarian tissue ( Li et al ., 2013 ; Nelson et al ., 1999 ; Wickenheisser et al ., 2005 ). This study for\nthe first time presented that M. arvensis hydroalcoholic extract\nconsiderably decreased the expression of Cyp17 in PCOS rats.\nIncreasing Cyp17 production increases androgen production.\nSubsequently, misplaced androgen production plays a pivotal role in the PCOS\netiology ( Rosenfield & Ehrmann, 2016 ).\nHence, reduction of PCOS symptoms in treated rats with M. arvensis extract can be due to the influence of this plant on downregulation of the Cyp17 expression and subsequently, reduction of androgen\nproduction.  The expression of Ptgs2 gene as a follicular phase marker was\nconsiderably high in the ovarian tissue of PCOS rats. Several studies reported high\nexpression of this gene in PCOS patients ( Liu et al ., 2016 ; Schmidt et al ., 2014 ). One of the mechanisms of\npathogenesis suggested that gene expression of zinc finger gene 217\n( Znf217 ) was decreased in PCOS rats and women. This gene\nincreases the expression of inflammatory genes, such as Ptgs2 and\nProstaglandin E2 ( Pge2 ) ( Zhai et al ., 2020 ).    CONCLUSION  This study confirmed that M. arvensis hydroalcoholic extract can be\nuseful as a treatment for PCOS patients by improving follicularization and\nregulating LH and FSH secretion. It seems that the antioxidant features of arvensis extract are beneficial in reducing the symptoms of\nthis disease, and it is suggested that different extract compounds, especially\nphenolic compounds, play an important role in this activity.",
