    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS) is the most common endocrine disease\nin patients with ovaries of reproductive age and seriously affects\nwomen\u2019s reproductive health. The prevalence of PCOS is approximately\n6\u201312% according to the diagnostic criteria. 1 , 2 PCOS\nis clinically heterogeneous, there is no single diagnostic test, and\nthe Rotterdam criteria are usually used to diagnose PCOS. 3 , 4 At present, the biochemical indicators for the diagnosis of PCOS\ninclude mainly anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), the luteinizing\nhormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio, and progesterone\n(Prog). Serum levels of AMH are significantly higher in PCOS patients\nthan in controls, reflecting functional ovarian reserve and serving\nas a biomarker of female reproductive potential. 5 The serum LH level is elevated in PCOS patients, and the\nLH/FSH ratio reflects ovarian reserve function to a certain extent. 6 In women with PCOS, the endometrium is often\ncharacterized by Prog resistance. 7 Therefore,\nthe clinical diagnosis of PCOS relies mainly on these biochemical\nindicators, and a single diagnostic gold standard is lacking.  The etiology of PCOS is complex, encompassing dysfunctions in the\nmetabolic, reproductive, and psychological domains, and these dysfunctions\nare frequently accompanied by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance\n(IR), obesity, metabolic irregularities, inflammation, and cardiovascular\nrisk factors. 8 \u2212 10 IR can induce dyslipidemia and lipid triads in routine\nclinical operations for diagnosing IR according to the Homeostasis\nModel Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (fasting plasma glucose\n(FPG, mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting insulin (FINS, mIU/L)/22.5). OVGP1 is\nan estrogen-induced secretory protein that plays a key role in sperm\ncapacitation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. 11 Our previous studies confirmed that OVGP1 is\na hypertensive factor that directly promotes vascular remodeling and\nis involved in regulating oxidative stress and metabolism-related\npathways. 12 Since PCOS is associated with\noxidative stress and some metabolic complications, 13 , 14 OVGP1 levels may be related to PCOS. However, the OVGP1 expression\nlevel and its clinical implications in patients with PCOS have never\nbeen reported.  Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore\nthe value of the\nserum OVGP1 level in females with PCOS and healthy controls. Spearman\u2019s\ncorrelation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis were\nused to investigate the associations between OVGP1 and endocrine\u2013metabolic\nparameters, and logistic regression analysis was further employed\nto identify the risk factors associated with PCOS. In addition, recursive\nfeature elimination based on cross-validation (RFE-CV) algorithm was\nused to screen existing diagnostic markers for PCOS. Six machine learning\nalgorithms and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were\nused to evaluate the diagnostic value of OVGP1 for PCOS, and an optimal\nclassifier was ultimately determined for the discovery of novel clinical\ndiagnostic biomarkers.    2  Materials and Methods   2.1  Study Design and Participants  In\nthis cross-sectional study, serum was collected from 70 women with\nPCOS who met the inclusion criteria and 60 age-matched controls at\nthe Xijing Hospital from April 2022 to June 2023. The inclusion criteria\nwere as follows: age 18\u201340 years 15 and meeting the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment\nand management of PCOS 2023, which revises the 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic\ncriteria. 16 Excluding other causes, a diagnosis\nof PCOS can be made if one of the following criteria is met: (1) irregular\nmenstrual cycles and clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism;\n(2) irregular menstrual cycles and no clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism\nor were not obvious, and the biochemical examination showed hyperandrogenemia;\n(3) only irregular menstrual cycles or hyperandrogenemia, adult women\nneed further ultrasound examination, if the presence of polycystic\novary monography, the diagnosis of PCOS; adolescents were included\nin the high-risk management of PCOS and were followed up regularly.\nOther causes to be excluded mainly include thyroid-stimulating hormone,\nprolactin (PRL), 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone, follicle-stimulating\nhormone, or related causes that need to be excluded if there are clinical\ncharacteristics (such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, adrenal tumor,\netc.). Hypogonadotropin-induced hypogonadism (usually caused by low\nfat or prolonged vigorous exercise) can be ruled out in combination\nwith clinical and LH and FSH levels. 17 All\nparticipants underwent an analysis of sex hormones (Roche Cobas 6000\nCE Line E601 Lab Chemistry Analyzer, Germany), an evaluation of thyroid\nfunction (Roche Cobas 6000 CE Line E801 Lab Chemistry Analyzer, Germany),\nan analysis of a four-item panel of blood lipids (Hitachi 7060 Automatic\nBiochemical Analyzer, Japan), glucose tolerance tests (BIOELAB ES-480\nAutomatic Biochemical Analyzer, China), and 25(OH)-vitamin D tests\n(Roche Cobas 6000 CE Line E601 Lab Chemistry Analyzer, Germany) to\nestablish the baseline characteristics. The study was approved by\nthe ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth\nMilitary Medical University, and informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.    2.2  Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent\nAssay (ELISA)  Serum OVGP1 was measured using an ELISA kit\n(LifeSpan, Seattle,\nWA, USA). All procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Standard substances of different concentrations were\nprepared. Then, 100 \u03bcL of standard substances and 100 \u03bcL\nof serum samples were added to 96-well plates coated with the OVGP1\nprotein antibody and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. The mixture\nwas subsequently discarded, 100 \u03bcL of the biotin OVGP1 antibody\nconjugate was added, the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1\nh, and the unbound antibodies were removed by washing three times.\nNext, 100 \u03bcL of HRP-conjugated reagent was added, and the mixture\nwas incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 0.5 h and washed five times with washing\nsolution. Subsequently, 90 \u03bcL of TMB substrate was added, the\nsample was shielded from light at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min, 50 \u03bcL\nof stop solution was added, the absorbance was read at 450 nm with\na multifunctional enzyme marker (TECAN Infinite200 PRO), and the OVGP1\nconcentration was calculated. All of the assays were carried out in\nduplicate at minimum, and average absorbance data were obtained from\nthree independently repeated experiments.    2.3  Performance\nEvaluation of Candidate Signatures\nvia Machine Learning Algorithms  To evaluate the application\nof the biomarkers, we used RFE-CV algorithms to screen candidate signatures\naccording to clinical indicators in PCOS patients and controls. 18 To accurately predict the performance of the\ndiagnostic model, we used six machine learning classification algorithms\nin Python, i.e., adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting\n(XGBoost), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic\nregression (LR), and random forest (RF), to discriminate PCOS patients\nfrom controls. 19 \u2212 21 Furthermore, we used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure\nthe stability and accuracy of the classifiers and calculated five\nmeasurements, namely, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive\npredictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The ROC\ncurve was used to evaluate the discriminant ability of the prediction\nmodel, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to estimate the\nclinical usefulness and net benefit of the model. 22    2.4  Statistical Analysis  SPSS 21.0 (IBM\nCorp., NY, USA) was used for the data analysis. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov\ntest was used to determine whether the data fit a normal distribution.\nFor parametric data, Student\u2019s t test was\nused, and for nonparametric data, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was\nused to determine the difference between the two groups. The measurement\ndata are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations and medians\n(interquartile distances). The difference in the OVGP1 expression\nbetween the two groups is represented by a violin diagram. Spearman\u2019s\ncorrelation analysis and multiple linear regression models were used\nto assess the associations between OVGP1 and other diagnostic indicators.\nLogistic regression analysis was performed to predict the exposure\nrisk in PCOS patients. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) 23 and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) 24 were used to assess the impact of adding OVGP1\ndetection on the reclassification of a predictive model. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.     3  Results   3.1  Demographics and Clinical\nCharacteristics\nof the Participants Enrolled in the Study  A total of 130\nparticipants were recruited for this study. The baseline characteristics\nand clinical outcomes of patients with PCOS and controls are listed\nin Table 1 . There were\nno significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) between\npatients with PCOS and controls. The levels of LH (13.030 (8.060,\n20.070) vs 5.500 (3.660, 9.250) mIU/L, p < 0.001),\nLH/FSH (2.446 (1.708, 3.458) vs 0.986 (0.612, 1.406), p < 0.001), and AMH (6.940 (5.050, 9.390) vs 3.260 (1.620, 4.810)\nng/mL, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in\nthe PCOS group than those in the control group, which was consistent\nwith the biochemical performance of PCOS, 25 while the levels of other hormones were not different from those\nin the control group. IR and metabolic disorders are common symptoms\nin patients with PCOS. 26 Subsequently,\ncomparisons were made between the two groups regarding endocrine and\nmetabolic parameters. The results showed that the HOMA-IR (2.316 (1.582,\n3.335) vs 1.460 (0.936, 2.392), p < 0.001), FPG\n(4.800 (4.410, 5.240) vs 4.560 (3.790, 4.910) mmol/L, p = 0.019), the levels of FINS (11.090 (7.780, 15.260) vs 7.940 (6.520,\n10.600) mIU/L, p < 0.001), and the levels of fasting\nC-peptide (FCP, 2.400 (1.940, 3.310) vs 2.020 (1.610, 2.600) ng/mL, p = 0.016) were significantly increased in PCOS patients\ncompared with the control groups. Likewise, the levels of thyroglobulin\n(Tg, 6.980 (3.690, 10.810) vs 13.200 (4.650, 16.300) ng/mL, p = 0.035), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C,\n1.270 (1.050, 1.520) vs 1.420 (1.180, 1.680) mmol/L, p = 0.009), and the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio (TC/HDL-C, 3.414\n(2.940, 4.188) vs 3.036 (2.658, 3.708), p = 0.012)\nwere also significantly different between the PCOS and control groups.\nThese changes were associated with the clinical phenotypes of PCOS\nand were consistent with the results of the metabolic parameter analysis.

The data were compared with normal distribution using\nStudent\u2019s t test. The Mann\u2013Whitney\nU test is used for non-normal distributions. A p -value\n< 0.05 was considered significant.       3.2  The OVGP1 Serum Level Is Significantly Decreased\nin Patients with PCOS  To evaluate the level of OVGP1 in patients\nwith PCOS, we measured differences in the serum OVGP1 concentration\nbetween patients with PCOS and controls by using ELISA. As shown in Figure 1 a, the serum expression\nlevel of OVGP1 was significantly lower in patients with PCOS than\nin those in the control group (120 \u00b1 39.67 vs 180 \u00b1 93.19\npg/mL, p < 0.001), which indicates that OVGP1\nmay be a diagnostic biomarker for PCOS.

The area and color intensity of the round\ncake indicate the strength of the correlation.       3.3  Correlations between OVGP1 Expression Levels\nand Clinical Characteristics in PCOS Patients  To explore\nthe correlations between OVGP1 expression and clinical characteristics\nin patients with PCOS, Pearson and Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses\nwere performed to assess the associations between the levels of OVGP1\nand clinical indicators of PCOS. The results revealed that the OVGP1\nlevel was positively correlated with the FSH level (rho = 0.39, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with the LH/FSH ratio\n(rho = \u22120.25, p < 0.01) ( Figure 1 b,c). However, the OVGP1 level\ndid not significantly correlate with any other diagnostic indicator\n( p > 0.05), as shown in Table S1 . Multivariate joint distribution revealed differences in\nthe OVGP1, LH, LH/FSH, AMH, and FSH data distributions between the\nPCOS and control groups ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, we performed multivariate linear regression\nto analyze the associations between OVGP1 and endocrine and metabolic\nparameters. The results also revealed that the OVGP1 level was significantly\npositively correlated with the baseline serum FSH concentration (\u03b2\n= 0.444, p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).

We found that with a one-unit increase in\nLH and AMH, the odds ratios (ORs) for PCOS occurrence were 1.228 (95%\nCI: 1.105\u20131.366, p < 0.001) and 1.276 (95%\nCI: 1.068\u20131.526, p = 0.007), respectively.\nAdditionally, the ORs for PCOS occurrence were 0.454 (95% CI: 0.263\u20130.782, p = 0.004) and 0.983 (95% CI: 0.972\u20130.995, p = 0.006), with one-unit increases in FSH and OVGP1, respectively\n( Table 3 ). These results\nsuggest that an increase in LH and AMH levels or a decrease in FSH\nand OVGP1 levels could increase the risk of PCOS in females.

Six signatures, including\nLH/FSH, Prog, TC, TG, HDL-C, and AMH, were constructed ( Figure 3 a). Next, we used six machine\nlearning algorithms to further evaluate the optimal diagnostic models\nfor these indices. Among these classifiers, the performance of XGBoost\nwas superior to that of each of the other five algorithms ( Figure 3 b,c); the area under\nthe curve (AUC) for the model was 0.953 (95% CI = 0.916\u20130.990)\nin the training set and 0.907 (95% CI = 0.855\u20130.959) in the\ntesting set ( Table 4 ). When OVGP1 was combined with the six signatures, the AUCs of the\nXGBoost and LR models increased to 0.963 (95% CI = 0.931\u20130.995)\nand 0.833 (95% CI = 0.764\u20130.902), respectively, indicating\nthat the addition of OVGP1 detection can be used to improve diagnostic\nperformance in patients suspected of having PCOS ( Figure 3 d). The DCA curve calculates\nthe clinical net benefit of each predictive model within the risk\nthreshold probability range. The results showed that the net benefit\nof Model 2 (six signatures and OVGP1) was superior to that of Model\n1 (six signatures), which met the practical requirements of clinical\ndiagnosis ( Figure 3 e). In addition, when the two models were compared, as shown in Figure 3 f, the NRI was 3.81%\nand the IDI was 7.4% (1.1%\u201313.7%, p = 0.021),\nwhich suggested that the combination of OVGP1 with the other six signatures\nimproved the diagnostic performance of PCOS.

LH, LH/FSH, and AMH serum levels\nare the most frequently used criteria for assessing ovarian reserve. 27 Consequently, we compared the diagnostic efficacy\nof individual hormones, such as LH, LH/FSH, and AMH, as well as their\ncombination. The AUCs of the ROC curves were 0.789 for LH, 0.846 for\nLH/FSH, and 0.778 for AMH. We found that all the ROC curves had high\naccuracy, with an AUC > 0.7, which reveals the predictive efficacy\nof all four indicators ( Figure 4 a). The combined diagnosis had an AUC of 0.930 (95% CI: 0.885\u20130.975),\nwith a sensitivity of 90.00%, a specificity of 81.67%, and an accuracy\nof 86.15%, surpassing that of a single diagnostic index. Moreover,\nwhen OVGP1 was included, the AUC increased to 0.932 (95% CI: 0.888\u20130.976),\nthe specificity increased to 86.67%, and the accuracy increased to\n88.46% for differentiating between patients with PCOS and controls\n( Figure 4 b,d). The\nDCA showed that the two diagnostic models are suitable for clinical\napplication ( Figure 4 c). Similarly, the IDI and NRI were also used to compare the advantages\nand disadvantages of the two prediction models, and the results showed\nan NRI of 5% and an IDI of 8.5% (95% CI: 2.2%\u201314.8%, p = 0.008). These results indicate that the reclassification\nability of OVGP1 was significantly improved after its inclusion.

Model 1 represents\nthe combination of LH, the LH/FSH ratio, and AMH; Model 2 represents\nthe combination of LH, the LH/FSH ratio, AMH, and OVGP1.        4  Discussion  In this study, we are the\nfirst to report the level of OVGP1 in\npatients with PCOS and report that OVGP1 is significantly decreased\nin patients with PCOS, is positively associated with FSH, and is negatively\nassociated with the LH/FSH ratio. We also screened the ability of\nsix signatures (LH/FSH, Prog, TC, TG, HDL-C, and AMH) to discriminate\nPCOS patients from controls via machine learning algorithms and found\nthat the diagnostic value of OVGP1 alone and in combination with the\nsix signatures or clinically applied markers for distinguishing PCOS\npatients from controls is high. Moreover, our study shows that a decrease\nin the level of OVGP1 expression can increase the risk of PCOS.  Anovulation is a major cause of infertility in 90% of women with\nPCOS, and OVGP1 is a major tubal glycoprotein in many species that\nis essential for sperm motility, fertilization, and embryonic development,\nand it may also be involved in female ovulation function. 11 , 28 , 29 Genetic mechanisms play an important\nrole in the etiology of PCOS. The ERK-1 and ERK-2 pathways are among\nthe most important of these mechanisms. In some studies, it has been\nstated that OVGP1 levels may be related to ERK gene pathways. 30 \u2212 33 The MEK/ERK pathway is closely related to androgen secretion; 14 therefore, OVGP1 may also be involved in androgen\nsecretion. Hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation\nare associated with PCOS. 34 In this study,\nwe also found that HDL-C levels were decreased and HOMA-IR was increased\nin women with PCOS. Our previous study revealed that OVGP1 induced\nvascular oxidative stress and inflammation, 12 which suggested that OVGP1 is associated with the pathophysiology\nof PCOS. The exact mechanism of OVGP1 in PCOS patients should be explored\nin future studies.  In addition, reproductive function is closely\nrelated to the endocrine\nsystem, and PCOS is characterized by a series of interrelated changes\nin reproductive hormones, 35 and the relationship\nbetween OVGP1 and PCOS has not been evaluated at either the clinical\nor basic level. Therefore, we conducted this first clinical study\nto analyze the correlation between OVGP1 and diagnostic indicators\nof PCOS.  Reproduction occurs through the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013ovary\naxis, which coordinates reproductive behavior with ovulation. Gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus regulates the secretion\nof FSH and LH, and E2 levels increase as follicles develop. 36 , 37 An increase in E2 in turn stimulates the release of GnRH, and the\nrelease of OVGP1 is dependent on estrogen. 38 , 39 In our study, a significant positive correlation between OVGP1 and\nFSH was evident, which suggested that OVGP1 may play an important\nrole in promoting follicle development and ovulation. Studies have\nreported that in women, LH and FSH are positively correlated from\nthe beginning of the reproductive stage up to menopause, 40 which is consistent with our findings. We next\nused multiple linear regression to determine how OVGP1 and FSH are\ncorrelated, and the results confirmed our findings and highlighted\nhow complex and close the regulatory relationships between sex hormones\nare. Subsequent logistic regression analysis revealed that a decrease\nin the level of OVGP1 was an independent risk factor for PCOS and\nmay indirectly influence the development of PCOS by regulating hormone\nlevels.  We also evaluated biochemical indicators as predictors\nof PCOS\nvia machine learning algorithms. In particular, we observed that the\nXGBoost model had the best predictive performance for PCOS diagnosis\nand that the analysis of the six signatures through the XGBoost model\nwas able to predict PCOS with an accuracy of 88.46%; however, combining\nOVGP1 with the six signatures resulted in an increased accuracy of\n89.23%. In the context of routine PCOS diagnosis, the primary focus\nis on sex hormone levels. We developed a diagnostic model encompassing\nsex hormones, and the AUC was 0.932 (95% CI = 0.888\u20130.976),\nwith an accuracy of 88.46%. Silva used a machine learning algorithm\nto incorporate 14 variables with an accuracy of 86% and an AUC of\n97%. 41 These results indicate that our\nmodel (four indicators) is well suited for clinical implementation,\nwhile reducing the cost of examination. This finding implies that\nwell-designed machine learning has the potential to significantly\nenhance our ability to diagnose PCOS early, with associated cost savings\nand a reduced burden of PCOS on patients and the health system. 42 , 43  The main objective of our study was to provide a new diagnostic\nindex for PCOS. Feature selection methods were applied to select the\noptimal subset of features to combine with OVGP1, and the results\nshowed that XGBoost with RFE feature selection achieved the highest\nperformance compared to that of a single index. The application of\na machine learning algorithm can be useful for guiding more personalized\nand effective approaches for diagnosing PCOS and preventing its comorbidities.\nHowever, this study has several limitations. First, the sample in\nthis study was limited, and a larger multicenter study with more participants\nis needed to externally validate the diagnostic value of OVGP1. Second,\nthe lack of multilayer distribution analysis and the presence of some\npatients with irregular menstruation in the control group may lead\nto the underestimation of the diagnostic efficacy of OVGP1 for PCOS;\nin the future, additional clinical samples need to be collected for\nclinical verification. Finally, the potential functions of OVGP1 in\npatients with PCOS should be explored via cell and animal experiments.    5  Conclusion  In this study, we report\nOVGP1 levels in PCOS patients for the\nfirst time. The level of OVGP1 is significantly decreased in PCOS\npatients and is associated with FSH and the LH/FSH ratio, and the\nOVGP1 level may be an independent predictor of PCOS occurrence. Furthermore,\nwe identified six signatures (LH/FSH, Prog, TC, TG, HDL-C, and AMH)\nby machine learning that perform well in the diagnosis of PCOS patients\nwith a diagnostic accuracy of 88.46%. Considering the cost and benefit,\nthe accuracy of the combination of three clinical indicators (LH,\nLH/FSH, and AMH) was 86.15%. With the addition of the OVGP1 index,\nthe accuracy rate increased to 89.23% and 88.46%, respectively, which\nimproved the diagnostic ability and emphasized that OVGP1 helps to\ndiagnose PCOS.",
