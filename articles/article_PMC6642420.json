    "abstract": "Infertile females experience some types of distress such as social stress, depression, and sexual dys-\nfunction that may be exacerbated by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The current study aimed at comparing\npsychological profile of infertile females with PCOS with that of women without PCOS with respect to four domains:\ninfertility stress, depression, sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia. The current case-control study was conducted on 240 infertile females (120 with\nPCOS and 120 without PCOS) in Fatemeh Azahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research Center (Babol,\nIran) from 2016 to 2017. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the fertility problem inven-\ntory (FPI), the female sexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto\nalexithymia scale (TAS-20). Females with PCOS had higher FPI total scores than the ones without PCOS (120.68 \u00b1 29.42 vs. 112.83 \u00b1\n30.94). Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of social stress and rejection of a future life without a\nchild were higher in females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS (P<0.05). Also, the mean total scores of alexithy-\nmia symptoms (TAS-20) in females with PCOS were significantly higher than those of the ones without PCOS (59.83\n\u00b1 11.36 vs. 55.69 \u00b1 11.52). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean scores of\ndepression symptoms and sexual function. Infertile females with PCOS experienced higher levels of infertility stress and inability to distinguish\nand describe their feelings compared with the ones without PCOS. It is suggested that infertility care providers should\nprovide more psychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the \nmost common etiological factors of infertility which is \nidentified in up to 20% of infertile females ( 1 ). Studies \nemphasized that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders \nis high in patients with PCOS. A longitudinal \nstudy reported a prevalence of 40% for depression in \npatients with PCOS ( 2 ). A cohort study reported that \nPCOS can increase the risk of schizophrenia, bipolar \ndisorder, personality disorders, and tics ( 3 ). Other psychiatric \ndisorders such as anxiety, eating disorders, and \nsexual dysfunction disorders are common in patients \nwith PCOS ( 4 ). In addition, females with PCOS reported \nlower body image satisfaction compared to the ones \nwithout PCOS ( 5 ). Clinical manifestations of PCOS including \nmenstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and acne may \nexacerbate distress in the affected females ( 6 ).  Many females experience infertility as a feeling of \ndistress and stigma ( 7 ). Infertile females experience \nsome types of distress such as social stress, depression, \nsexual dysfunction, and marital dissatisfaction ( 8 - 10 ) \nthat may be exacerbated by PCOS. Kitzinger and Willmott \n( 11 ) introduced PCOS as a stigma, \u201cthe thief of \nwomanhood\u201d. Infertile females with PCOS and infertility \nproblems may experience being less feminine, due \nto excessive hair growth and absence of or irregular \nmenstrual periods ( 12 ). Additionally, infertility management \nprocesses such as assisted reproductive techniques \nare more stressful in females with PCOS than \nthe ones without it ( 13 ).  Alexithymia is a personality construct with inability \nin normal affect regulation that is comprised of five \ncharacteristics including difficulty to identify and distinguish \nemotions from bodily sensations, difficulty to \ndescribe and verbalize emotions, externally oriented \nthinking style, poverty of fantasy life, and poor empathy \n( 14 ). This personality construct is a risk factor for \nvarious physical and mental health problems including \nanxiety, depression, compulsive or addictive behaviors, \nphysical symptoms, and potentially somatic diseases \n( 15 ). Since a previous study showed that infertile \nfemales had higher rates of alexithymia than the fertile \nones ( 16 ), it was assumed that the rate of alexithymia \nmay differ among infertile females with different levels \nof stress. Therefore, infertile females with PCOS may \nhave different levels of alexithymia compared with the \nones without PCOS.  Although many previous studies indicated that psychiatric \ndisorders are common in patients with PCOS \n( 2 - 6 ), few researches reported psychiatric symptoms \nin females with PCOS and infertility. Diamond et al. \n( 16 ) concluded that female sexual dysfunction does not \nvary between infertile females with PCOS and the ones \nwith unexplained infertility. Another study reported that \ninfertility did not appear to constitute a risk factor of \npsychological distress in females with PCOS ( 17 ). As \ndifferences in psychological profiles between infertile \nfemales with PCOS and those without PCOS are not \nclear yet, the current study aimed at comparing the psychological \nprofile of these two groups. To the authors\u2019 \nbest knowledge, it was the first study that compared psychological \nprofiles of infertile females with and without \nPCOS in terms of four domains: infertility stress, \ndepression, female sexual dysfunction, and alexithymia \n(i.e. the inability to distinguish and describe feelings and \nthe absence of fantasies).    Materials and Methods   Participants  The current case-control study was conducted in Fatemeh \nAzahra Infertility and Reproductive Health Research \nCenter (Babol, Iran) from May 2016 to December \n2017 on 240 infertile females selected through census \nsampling method. The case group was composed of 120 \nfemales with a definite diagnosis of PCOS. The control \ngroup was comprised of 120 infertile females without \nPCOS based on Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Besides, \nthe control group was matched with the case group in \nterms of age, level of education, and duration of infertility.  Inclusion criteria for infertile females with and without \nPCOS were being 15-45 years old, completion of \nprimary school as the minimum level of education, being \nmarried and having an active sex life, and lacking \nany problems in speaking or understanding the Persian \nlanguage; also, a definite diagnosis of PCOS was an \nadditional criterion for PCOS group. Definite diagnosis \nof PCOS was done based on two of the following Rotterdam \ndiagnostic criteria: ultrasound scan of PCOS \n(presence of .12 follicles in one or both ovaries and/\nor increased ovarian volume >10 mL), clinical signs of \nhyperandrogenism (hirsutism or obvious acne), and/or \nan elevated plasma testosterone level, and/or irregular \nmenstrual periods (interval between menstrual periods \n>35 days, amenorrhea defined as the absence of vaginal \nbleeding for .6 months, and/or variable menstruation) \n( 18 , 19 ).  Exclusion criteria for all participants (females with \nand without PCOS) were diagnosis of the husband with \nazoospermia or oligospermia, presence of other disorders \nthat could mimic PCOS syndrome such as congenital \nadrenal hyperplasia, thyroid disease, or hyperprolactinemia.    Procedure  Four staff of the infertility center explained the study\u2019s \nobjectives to the participants and accordingly, the subjects \nwere required to sign the written informed consent \nforms. The staff interviewed the subjects and recorded \ntheir demographic characteristics, as well as their medical \nand gynecological history. Furthermore, the subjects \nwere asked to complete five questionnaires of the study \nincluding the fertility problem inventory (FPI), the female \nsexual function index (FSFI), the Beck depression \ninventory-II (BDI-II), and the Toronto alexithymia scale \n(TAS-20). First, 258 females (129 with and 129 without \nPCOS) were enrolled of which 240 females with infertility \n(120 with and 120 without PCOS) completed the \nquestionnaires.    Ethical considerations  The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee \nof Babol University of Medical Sciences \n(No.4834).    Measures   Demographic questionnaire  Demographic characteristics including age, educational \nlevel, infertility history, clinical information of \nPCOS, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) history \nwere obtained from the subjects. In addition, weight \nand height were measured in order to obtain body mass \nindex (BMI).    Infertility stress  Infertility stress was assessed using FPI developed by \nNewton in 1999. It is a multi-dimensional tool to detect \nstress and infertility problems. The FPI is comprised \nof 46 questions divided in five subscales: social concern, \nsexual concern, relationship concern, rejection of \nparenthood, and the need for parenthood. Each item is \nscored based on a six-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 \n(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The total score \nranges from 46 to 276 with higher scores representing \nhigher levels of stress ( 20 ). Validity and reliability of the \nPersian version of FPI were previously examined ( 21 ). \nIn the current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of \nthe FPI was 0.898.     Sexual function  The FSFI was used to assess sexual function in subjects. \nThe FSFI assesses sexual function over the past four \nweeks. It covers six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, \norgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The score for each domain \nranges from 0 or 1 to 5 with higher scores representing \nbetter sexual function ( 22 ). It was previously shown that \nthe Persian version of FSFI has high validity and reliability \n( 23 ). In the current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient \nof the FSFI was 0.896.    Depression symptoms  Depression was measured by the BDI-II. It is a self-\nreported scale and a screening instrument for depression \nwith 21 items, most of which assess depressive symptoms \non a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Total \nscores range from 0 to 63. In clinical settings, the severity \nof depression based on BDI-II, is classified as follows: \n0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-\n28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression \n( 24 ). A valid Persian version of the BID-II was used in \nthe current study. The internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \nalpha=0.87) and test re-test reliability (r=0.74) of the \nBID-II Persian was high and acceptable ( 25 ). In the current \nstudy, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of the BDI-II \nwas 0.915.    Alexithymia  In the current study, alexithymia was assessed using \nTAS-20. It is one of the most common instruments to \nmeasure alexithymia that has 20 items in three subscales: \ndifficulty to describe emotions, difficulty to \nidentify feelings (DIF), and externally-oriented thinking. \nItems are scored based on a five-point Likert \nscale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly \nagree). The total alexithymia score ranges from 20 to \n100 ( 26 ). A study conducted by Besharat supported the \ninternal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent \nvalidity of the Persian version of TAS-20 ( 27 ). In \nthe current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of \nthe TAS-20 was 0.809.    Statistical analysis  All data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, \nversion 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To present \ncharacteristics of females with and without PCOS, \ncontinuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD and \ncategorical variables as numbers (%). Chi-square test \nwas employed to compare categorical variables such \nas educational attainment level, duration of infertility, \nregularity of menstruation, and BMI between the two \ngroups. Also, independent samples t test was employed \nto compare the means of age and duration of marriage \nbetween the two groups. In addition, comparisons of \nthe mean scores between females with PCOS and those \nwithout PCOS in all four questionnaires and their subscales \nincluding FPI, FSFI, TAS-20, and BDI-II, were \ndone using independent t test. A P<0.0.5 was considered \nstatistically significant.     Results  Table 1 provides the summarized demographic information \nof subjects in the two groups. There were no \nsignificant differences between the two groups regarding \nthe subjects\u2019 age, husbands\u2019 age, educational level \nof the subjects, educational level of their husbands, and \nduration of infertility (P>0.05 in all cases). The frequency \nof irregular menstruation was significantly higher \nin females with PCOS than the ones without PCOS \n(P<0.001).

Depression symptoms (0-63), Minimum (0-13), mild (14-19), moderate (20-28), severe (29-63). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD or n (%).     Of the subscales of infertility stress, the mean scores of \nsocial stress and rejection of life without child were higher \nin females with PCOS than those of the other group \n(P=0.024 and P=0.021, respectively). There were no significant \ndifferences in the mean scores of subscales of \nsexual stress, marital stress, and parental stress between \nthe two groups. Also, females with PCOS had higher total \nmean scores of alexithymia symptoms (TAS-20) than \nthe ones without PCOS (59.83 \u00b1 11.36 vs. 55.69 \u00b1 11.52, \nP=0.005). Of the subscales of TAS-20, DIF and difficulty \nto describe feeling were significantly higher in females \nwith PCOS than the ones in the other group (P<0.001 and \nP=0.015, respectively). There was no significant difference \nbetween the two groups in the mean scores of depression \nsymptoms. In addition, severity of depressive \nsymptoms did not significantly differ between the two \ngroups (18.06 \u00b1 12.03 vs. 15.65 \u00b1 11.76, P=0.121). Total \nscores of FSFI and all its six subscales did not significantly \ndiffer between the two groups (25.13 \u00b1 3.95 vs. 25.35 \n\u00b1 3.87, P=0.660).    Discussion  The current study aimed at comparing the psychological \nprofiles of infertile females with PCOS with those of \nwomen without PCOS. The results showed that females \nwith PCOS had higher total mean scores of infertility \nstress (FPI) than the ones without PCOS. Infertile females \nwith PCOS had more social concerns than the ones \nin the other group. Also, infertile females with PCOS had \nmore stress of rejection of life without child than the other \ngroup. To the authors' best knowledge, no published study \nhas examined various aspects of infertility stress in infertile \nfemales with and without PCOS. However, some studies \nevaluated social relationships in patients with PCOS \ncompared to the controls. Such studies reported that the \nsocial relationships of patients with PCOS was more impaired \ncompared to the normal population ( 28 , 29 ). A recent \nstudy on the development of specific measurements \nof quality of life in patients with PCOS emphasized on the \nnegative effects of PCOS on family and friends and social \nrelationships ( 30 ). Consistently, another study reported \nthat the majority of females with PCOS (76.1%) worried \nabout their future life without any children ( 15 ).  Now, higher intensity of infertility stress observed in infertile \nfemales with PCOS compared to the ones without \nPCOS, should be explained. There are some hypotheses \nto explain this finding. First, the secondary analysis of the \ndata showed that symptoms of PCOS such as obesity and \nhirsutism were related to infertility stress. Second, some \nprevious studies confirmed that females with PCOS experienced \nsocial pressure due to hirsutism, especially excessive \nfacial hair ( 31 ). A study showed that hirsutism score \nof females with PCOS was significantly correlated with \nmental health status ( 32 ). Infertile females with PCOS \nthat had hirsutism felt \u201cunfeminine\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d ( 33 ). \nTherefore, social concerns of infertile females with PCOS \nmay be more than those of the ones without PCOS.  In contrast with the current study\u2019s expectation, the total \nscores of FSFI and all of its six subscales did not significantly \ndiffer between females with PCOS and those without \nPCOS. Results of some previous studies were consistent \nwith the findings of the present study reporting that \nfemales with PCOS did not have more depression symptoms \nthan the ones without PCOS ( 34 , 35 ). However, a \nstudy reported that infertile females with PCOS had significantly \nhigher depression scores compared to the ones \nwithout PCOS ( 36 ). A study reported that females with \nPCOS with ones with no desire for a child did not show \nsignificant differences in specific aspects of sexual satisfaction \ncompared to the ones with no desire for a child \n( 17 ). A recent study reported no significant difference in \nfemale sexual dysfunction disorders between infertile females \nwith PCOS and those without PCOS ( 16 ).  The current study also aimed at comparing the alexithymia \nbetween infertile females with and those without \nPCOS. The results of the current study indicated that infertile \nfemales with PCOS had higher alexithymia scores \nthan the ones without PCOS. Infertile females with PCOS \nhad more difficulty to identify their feelings and describe \ntheir emotions compared to the ones without PCOS. To \nthe authors\u2019 best knowledge, no previous study assessed \nthe alexithymia in infertile females with PCOS. Although \nthe current study did not have enough information about \nthe reasons for higher alexithymia in females with PCOS \ncompared to the ones without PCOS, several hypotheses \ncould be proposed. First, there are associations between \nalexithymia and maladaptation to stress. A study investigated \nthe association between alexithymia and fertility-\nrelated stress in females with infertility demonstrated that \nalexithymia was related to fertility-related stress. The \nauthors concluded that alexithymia acted as a secondary \ncoping strategy in females with infertility ( 37 ). Second, \nalexithymia is related to somatization disorders. A recent \nmeta-analysis reported that females with PCOS were more \nlikely to have higher somatization disorders compared to \nthe ones without PCOS ( 38 ). Third, another study introduced \nalexithymia and somatization as the consequences \nof maladaptation to stress of infertility ( 39 ). Therefore, it \nis supposed that high somatization in females with PCOS \nand infertility was comorbid with alexithymia and higher \ninfertility stress than ones without PCOS.  Due to some limitations of the current study, data \nshould be interpreted with caution. First, the case-control \nnature of the current study prevents drawing any conclusions \nconcerning possible relationships. Prospective \ncohort studies in the area using reliable approaches are \nrequired to describe the casual relationship between infertile \nfemales with PCOS and those without PCOS. Second, \ndata was collected using self-report scales that may result \nin underreporting of the conditions. Future studies using \nmore reliable methods such as interviewing, might give a \nbetter picture of the psychological profile of infertile females \nwith PCOS. Third, all of the patients included in \nthe current study were recruited from one hospital, rather \nthan multiple centers, that could be a limitation of the current \nstudy. Fourth, the study sample was small and cannot \nbe generalized to numerous phenotypes of PCOS. Further, \nmulti-centered studies with larger sample sizes are \nrecommended. Finally, since the study was the first work \nthat showed higher alexithymia in infertile females with \nPCOS, more studies in the area should investigate the extent \nof the associations between alexithymia and PCOS \nin females with infertility. Additionally, future studies are \nrequired to clarify how alexithymia arises in infertile females \nwith PCOS.    Conclusion  The current study results showed that infertile females \nwith PCOS experience more infertility stress than the \nones without PCOS. Also, infertile females with PCOS \nhad higher means of alexithymia, especially with respect \nto the ability to distinguish and describe, compared to the \nones without PCOS. The results of the current study indicated \nthat infertility care providers should provide more \npsychosocial support for infertile females with PCOS. \nThe current study was a step to present the profiles of infertile \nfemales with PCOS; thus, further longitudinal studies \nare required to follow the changes in psychological \nprofiles of females with and without PCOS during infertility \ntreatment.",
