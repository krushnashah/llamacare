    "body": "1.  Introduction  PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular risk factors [ 1 ] Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disorder and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age 5%\u201310% [ 1 ]. A wide range of pathophysiological changes are related to neuroendocrine, immunology, protein metabolism, sugar metabolism, fat metabolism, and abnormal local ovarian regulatory factors [ 2 ].  The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders [ 3 ].  In recent years, it was found that the levels of inflammatory marker factors (such as C-reactive protein, calcitonin, tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, IL-18.) in peripheral blood of patients with PCOS were significantly higher than those in the control group, suggesting that PCOS may be a chronic inflammatory reactive disease [ 3 ].  Inflammation is usually caused by microbial infection, the toll-like receptor can recognize the inflammatory response induced by invasive pathogens, activate the downstream signal pathway, and promote the expression of pro-inflammatory factor protein gene [ 4 , 5 ]. Toll-like receptor (TLR) is a member of pattern recognition receptor (PRRS) family, which plays an important role in innate immunity and adaptive immunity. TLR is classified by recognizing different ligands. At present, the main human-related receptors are TLR1-TLR10 [ 6 ], widely expressed in cells of innate immune system and adaptive immune system, and expressed in macrophages, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, parenchymal organ cells, T cells, B cells, mast cells, and other cells. Recently, it has been found that endogenous cytokines released from tissue injury and endogenous molecules from saturated fatty acids can activate TLR [ 7 ], which indicates that TLR not only mediates the inflammatory response caused by infection but also mediates the inflammation induced by endogenous molecules.  More strikingly, recent studies indicate that miRNAs can even serve as physiological ligands for toll-like receptors (TLRs), a function that is independent of their conventional role in post-transcriptional gene regulation [ 7 , 8 ].  It has been found that the expression levels of TLR2, TLR8, and CD14 in PCOS patients\u2019 samples increased significantly through functional and signal pathway enrichment analysis, and they also enriched significantly in inflammatory and immune-related signal pathways [ 8 ]. TLR8, as a member of TLRs family, is mainly located in the cytoplasm and expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells [ 9 ]. It can recognize the nucleic acids of bacteria or viruses [ 10 ] and plays an important role in innate immune response, cell signal transduction, neuron development, and cell apoptosis. At present, a large number of literatures have reported that TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are highly expressed in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, such as discoid lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and so on [ 11 ].  The interaction between miR-21/29a and TLR7/8 may cause macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), ultimately leading to tumor growth and metastasis [ 12 , 13 ]. Thus, by acting as paracrine ligands of TLRs, miRNAs are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment. This mechanism of action of miRNAs is implicated in tumor-immune system communication and is important in tumor growth and spread, thus representing a possible target for cancer treatment [ 14 ]. Studies have shown that TLR8 activation leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12.  The discovery of this new function of miRNAs raises some fascinating questions. First, what is the underlying mechanism through which miRNAs bind to intracellular TLRs? According to the current results, the GU-rich motif (GUUG for miR-21, GGUU for miR-29a, and GUUGUGU for let-7b) is essential for the miRNA-TLR recognition. Thus, individual miRNAs may contain important information that allows selective access of these miRNAs to TLRs [ 14 , 15 ].  Muller [ 16 ] found that human tumor cells can secrete miR-21 and miR-29a, which bind to TLR8 in immune cells and activate TLR8, leading to activation of NF-\u03baB and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. MiR-21 is a member of miRNAs, which can regulate multiple target genes through 3\u02b9UTR. The end complementary combination can degrade or block the translation of the target gene, lead to the abnormal expression of the target gene, regulate the biological functions such as cell proliferation, migration, and cycle, and play a role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of various tumors, which is closely related to multiple signaling pathways of human life activities. The aim of the study was to assess microRNA-21 regulates granulosa cell apoptosis and proliferation in polycystic ovary syndrome through target toll-like receptor 8.    2.

Discussion  The results of study showed that the mRNA and protein expression of TLR8 in PCOS granulosa cells were significantly increased compared with the normal group.  It is well known that PCOS is characterized by ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenemia, IR, and hyperinsulinemia [ 18 ]. More and more literatures analyzed the influencing factors of PCOS from the perspectives of endocrine, immunology, gene genetics, and molecular biology. All other research studies also showed same results and concluded that the levels of inflammatory marker factors (such as C-reactive protein, calcitonin, tumor necrosis factor, IL-6, IL-18.) in peripheral blood of PCOS patients were significantly higher than those of the control group, suggesting that PCOS may be a chronic inflammatory reactive disease [ 15 ]. So authors of the study found that the PCOS patients not only have abnormal endocrine metabolism but also having chronic inflammation.  The results of double luciferase reporter gene assay showed that there was no significant difference in luciferase activity compared with miR-21 transfected with TLR8 3\u02b9UTR mutant vector plasmid. The other studies also revealed the same findings.  miRNA is a kind of naturally occurring non-coding microRNA (ncRNA) with about 22 nucleotides [ 19 ]. More and more studies have shown the influence of miRNA on biological fields, such as development, differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, inflammatory response, and various diseases [ 20 ]. In mammalian systems, recent studies have shown that miRNAs regulate TLR signaling pathways at different levels, including TLRs, signaling proteins, transcription factors, cytokines, etc [ 21 ]. As we all know, miRNA binds to the complementary sites on the target mRNA through base pairing, which leads to translation inhibition or direct degradation of mRNA. However, recent studies have shown that miRNA can not only regulate gene transcription but also secrete into extracellular environment as signal molecules that mediate intercellular communication [ 22 ], or transport from cytoplasm to nucleus to regulate their own expression [ 23 ]. MiRNAs can even be used as physiological ligands of TLRs, and their functions are independent of their regulatory genes [ 16 ]. TLRs in cells including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 can detect foreign nucleic acids, including RNA from RNA viruses and DNA from bacteria and DNA viruses [ 24 ]. All the above results indicate that there is a certain relationship between miRNA and TLR signaling pathway. For TLR8, some studies have shown that miR-21 and miR-29 may secrete exosomes from tumor cells to immune cells, and combine with TLR8 to regulate intracellular signaling pathway [ 17 ].  The results of real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR showed that compared with the control group, the mRNA expression levels of TLR8, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 genes were significantly higher. The results of Western blot also showed that the expression of TLR8, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 gene protein in the transfected cells was significantly higher than that in the control cells. . TLR-8 can be activated by miR-21, which leads to the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12. The expression of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 in PCOS granulosa cells is significantly increased, which proves that TLR-8 is involved in the development of PCOS inflammation. MiR-21 is a member of miRNAs, which can regulate multiple target genes through 3\u02b9UTR. The end complementary combination can degrade or block the translation of the target gene, lead to the abnormal expression of the target gene [ 17 , 25 ], regulate the biological functions such as cell proliferation, migration and cycle, and play a role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of various tumors, which is closely related to multiple signaling pathways of human life activities. In our study, compared with NC group, the proliferation of PCOS granulosa cells increased after miR-21 mimics was transfected, and with the increase of time, the corresponding cell proliferation rate increased, that is, time-dependent. There was significant difference in the proliferation rate among the groups. The staining results HE PCOS ovarian granulosa cells showed that the cell density increased and the morphology changed after overexpression of miR-21 compared with that of untransfected group and transfected empty vector group. So , after overexpression of miR-21, the proliferation rate of PCOS granulosa cells increased significantly, while the apoptosis rate decreased. It is proved that miR-21 can regulate cell proliferation, migration, cycle and other biological functions, and play a role in the occurrence, development and metastasis of various tumors.  Conclusion: miR-21/ TLR8 involved in the PCOS inflammation, it provides profound insights into pathogenesis of PCOS. TLRs activate NF-\u03baB, MAPK signaling pathway, release NF-\u03baB, IFN \u2013 \u03b1, and other factors, up regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, initiate natural immune response, activate nonspecific immune response, participate in the process of immune defense, and play an important role in the formation and development of inflammation and tumor. The molecular mechanism of miR-21/TLR8 signaling pathway regulates which target genes affect the genesis and development of PCOS ovarian granulosa cells is the focus of our future research.",
