    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine and metabolic\ndisorder that affects 6% to 10% of women. PCOS is characterized by ovulatory\ndysfunction, menstrual irregularities hyperandrogenism, and polycystic\novaries. 1 , 2 The pathogenesis of PCOS remains unclear, but is known to be related to increased\ninsulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and\ncardiovascular diseases. PCOS remains a syndrome and no single diagnostic criterion\nis sufficient for clinical diagnosis.  Insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.\nHyperinsulinemia may contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction,\nhypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and leads to an increased risk for\nmetabolic disorders. 3,4 Recent studies showed that high levels of\nadvanced glycation end products and androgen induced inflammation and oxidative\nstress. 5 , 6 These studies also showed a strong association between endothelial dysfunction and\noxidative stress in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and these are prognostic indicators of\ncardiovascular disease, as well as recurrent pregnancy loss. Nitric oxide (NO) is\none of the most important regulators of vascular physiology, such as neuronal\ntransmission. NO is a relatively stable gas free radical that diffuses through the\ncell membrane. 7 Nitric oxide is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) during conversion\nof L-arginine using oxygen and NADPH as the cofactors. NO can adversely affect\ncarbohydrates, proteins and lipids and, together with other inflammatory mediators,\nresults in cell damage. 8 NO plays an inevitable role under physiological and pathological conditions\ninvolved in regulation of vascular tone, blood pressure, vascular remodeling, and inflammation. 9 Because of the short half-life of NO in vivo , measurement of\nNO levels in human is extremely difficult. However, NO produces the stable NO\nproducts of nitrate and nitrite. Previous studies have shown a causal relationship\nbetween NO and nitrite. 10  A recent study concluded that there was endothelial dysfunction in women with PCOS,\neven if they were young and non-obese. 11 Studies have indicated that patients with PCOS are under high oxidative stress. 6 In the past decade, various studies have examined nitrite in patients with\nPCOS and have investigated the associations between them. There is contradictory\nevidence on the level of nitrite in PCOS. Some studies have reported decreased\nnitrite levels in patients with PCOS, while some studies have found the opposite\nresult. 12 , 13 However, no meta-analyses have examined whether PCOS is\nassociated with NO. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to further examine the\nassociation between serum/plasma nitrite levels and PCOS (Supporting information:\nPRISMA Checklist). 14    Material and methods   Search strategy  Studies on PCOS and serum or plasma nitrite levels were identified. To identify\nall of the relevant original articles, we comprehensively searched a series of\nonline computerized databases, including EMBASE, Medline, and Web of Science,\nusing the key words \u201cnitric oxide\u201d, \u201cnitrate\u201d, \u201cnitrite\u201d, \u201cnitrosamine\u201d,\n\u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d, and \u201cPCOS\u201d using the operator OR or AND. Papers\nwere searched up to December 2018 and without limits of language. Reference\nsections from the identified literature were also reviewed in case of missing\nextra qualified papers. We first screened the titles and abstracts of the\nsearched studies, and then evaluated the full article in case it contained data\nregarding PCOS and serum or plasma nitrite levels. Two authors (MC and XXY)\nreviewed all abstracts and screened the reference lists. Disagreements were\nresolved by consensus.    Inclusion and exclusion criteria and data extraction  Original examinations were cautiously checked and there were no country\nlimitations in our study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all\nexamination and control subjects were limited to adults with PCOS and analyzed\nreliably by either the consensus statement declared at Rotterdam 15 or National Institute of Health (NIH) 16 criteria; (2) there was no significant difference in terms of body mass\nindex (BMI) and age in the study and control groups; (3) studies were restricted\nto humans, contained original information, and were present in either full-text\nor abstract form; (4) studies reported serum/plasma nitrite levels; and (5)\nstudies in which all PCOS group subjects did not have any conceivable inclining\nfactors (such as Cushing syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, ovarian tumors) that may\nbe related to their PCOS or those who were taking drugs (e.g., oral\ncontraceptives, other hormonal treatments) at the time of the study. The\nexclusion criteria were as follows: (1) duplicate publications, case reports,\nabstracts, non-English, review articles, and editorials; and (2) the data were\nnot sufficient for investigation or extraction of information.    Data extraction  Data were gathered for each study concerning the name of the first author,\npublication year, study design, sample size, age, nitrite levels, and BMI\n(mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) in patients with PCOS and in control subjects.    Risk of bias and statistical analysis  We evaluated the quality of each individual included study using the\nNewcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. 17 Meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane statistical software Review\nManager 5.3 (Copenhagen, Denmark). When P was \u2009<\u20090.05, the\nrandom effects model was applied according to the P value of\nchi-squared statistics. Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating the I 2 metric. An I 2 value \u2009>\u200975% was considered as high heterogeneity, an I 2 value between 50% and 75% as moderate\nheterogeneity, and an I 2 value between 25% and 50%\nas low heterogeneity. An I 2 value \u2009<\u200925% was\nconsidered homogeneous. If the I 2 value was\n\u2009>\u200950% the random effects model was used and if the I 2 value was \u2009<\u200950% the fixed effects model\nwas used to combine effect size. We also performed subgroup analysis and\nmeta-regression to determine the sources of heterogeneity. Repeated sensitivity\nanalysis was performed to estimate the effect of each individual study in the\nmeta-analysis by removing different individual studies each time. Nitrite levels\nin each study were calculated using the standard mean difference (SMD) with the\n95% confidence interval (CI).     Results   Study selection  Using our search strategy, we identified 98 potentially relevant articles from\nonline electronic databases and one study from reference records. Subsequent to\nexcluding copies, 88 records remained. After reading the titles or abstracts of\nthese 88 studies, we excluded 54 articles according to inclusion criteria. When\nwe screened the full text of the remaining 33 articles, 19 were excluded because\nthey did not report adequate data, one was not in English, and one study was a\nduplicate. Eventually, 12 articles including 16 studies satisfied the\neligibility criteria. 12 , 18        \u2013 27 The selection process is\nshown in Figure 1 and\nthe information of each study is shown in Table 1 .

Mean values are shown as standard deviation.     The meta-analysis included a total sample size of 895 (465 cases and 430\ncontrols) and all of them were case\u2013control studies. Three studies 13 , 21 , 25 reported\nresults separately for patients with obesity and PCOS and non-obese patients\nwith PCOS, and one study 27 reported plasma nitrite and nitrate study groups. Nine studies 12 , 13 , 18 \u2013 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 investigated European\npopulations and three studies 21 , 23 , 25 analyzed Asian\npopulations.    Meta-analysis results  A Forest plot of the relationship of PCOS with serum or plasma nitrite levels is\nshown in Figure 2 . We\nfound a significant association between PCOS and serum or plasma nitrite levels,\nwith a pooled SMD of \u22120.61 (95% CI: \u22121.05 to \u22120.16; P <\u20090.01). High significant heterogeneity\n( I 2 =\u200989%) was found among the studies.\nTherefore, the pooled data were determined by the random effects model.   Figure 2.

Subgroup analysis  The SMD (\u22120.09) for a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925 kg/m 2 in studies with a mean BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\nkg/m 2 was not significant (95% CI: \u22120.49 to 0.30, P >\u20090.01) ( Figure 3 ). The SMD (\u22121.01) for a BMI\n\u2009<\u200925\u2009kg/m 2 in studies with a mean BMI\n\u2009<\u200925\u2009kg/m 2 was not significant (95% CI: \u22121.78 to \u22120.24, P\u2009> 0.01) ( Figure 4 ). The SMD (\u22120.32) for age\u2009\u2265\u200925\nyears in studies with a mean age\u2009\u2265\u200925 years was not significant (95% CI: \u22121.11\nto 0.48, P\u2009> 0.01) ( Figure 5 ). The SMD (\u22120.80) for an age\n\u2009<\u200925 years in studies with a mean age \u2009<\u200925 years was not significant\n(95% CI: \u22121.62 to 0.01, P >\u20090.01) ( Figure 6 ). The SMD (\u22121.27) for Asian\nethnicity in studies with an Asian population was not significant (95% CI: \u22122.24\nto \u22121.30, P\u2009> 0.01) ( Figure 7 ). The SMD (\u22120.32) of European\nethnicity in studies with a European population was not significant (95% CI:\n\u22120.77 to 0.13, P >\u20090.01) ( Figure 8 ).   Figure 3.

Sensitivity analysis  Forest plots showed that our results had high heterogeneity\n( I 2 =\u200989%). Sensitivity analysis results showed\nthat the pooled value ranged from \u22120.43 (95% CI: \u22120.82 to \u22120.05) to \u22120.68 (95%\nCI: \u22121.14 to \u22120.22). Additionally, subgroup heterogeneity was also analyzed\n( I 2 =\u200953% for BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009kg/m 2 ; I 2 =\u200994% for BMI \u2009<\u200925\u2009kg/m 2 ; I 2 =\u200991% for age\u2009\u2265\u200925 years; I 2 =\u200993% for age \u2009<\u200925 years; I 2 =\u200985% for an Asian population; I 2 =\u200988% for a European population). However,\nsensitivity analysis results were different in the subgroups. In the BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\nkg/m 2 subgroup, the results dramatically changed when Taslipinar\net\u00a0al.\u2019s study 26 was removed ( I 2 decreased from 53% to 0%). In\nthe age\u2009\u2265\u200925 years subgroup, when we removed Krishna et\u00a0al.\u2019s study, 23 the I 2 decreased from 91% to 0%. In the Asian\npopulation subgroup, when we removed Krishna et\u00a0al.\u2019s study, 23 the I 2 decreased from 85% to 0%.\nMeta-regression analysis showed that the publication date may have been the\nsource of heterogeneity (publication date: \u22642010, P =\u20090.03;\ncountry: Europe, P =\u20090.10; sample size: PCOS \u226430, P =\u20090.78).    Quality assessment  The trim and fill technique showed that no investigation should have been\nstatistically corrected. Table 2 summarizes the consequences of the quality evaluation. The\nmethodological quality was evaluated as high in three studies, moderate in six\nstudies, and low in three studies.   Table 2.

Discussion  This meta-analysis showed that PCOS was associated with serum or plasma nitrite\nlevels. Furthermore, in patients with PCOS, serum or plasma nitrite levels were\nreduced compared with controls. The value of I 2 =\u200989\nshowed that there was high heterogeneity. We also performed subgroup analysis and\nmeta-regression to determine the sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, sensitivity\nanalysis showed that when any individual study was overlooked, the general outcomes\nremained the same. Therefore, our meta-analysis results appear to be reliable.  The mechanisms of PCOS are not completely understood, but recent studies suggest that\ninsulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. 3 Endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant\ndefense, excess androgen levels, and dyslipidemia have important effects on\ncardiovascular disease in patients with PCOS. 28 Orio et\u00a0al. 29 assessed youthful patients with PCOS and no metabolic and cardiovascular\ndisease and reported disturbance in endothelial functions in the early period of\nthis disease. However, Mather et\u00a0al. 30 showed normal endothelial function in patients with PCOS. Kandarakis et\u00a0al. 31 indicated that high serum androgen levels in women with PCOS may add to\nimpairment of endothelial structure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\nOur meta-analysis results support the outcomes from most previous studies 18 because serum or plasma nitrite levels were lower in patients with PCOS than\nin controls.  Sorensen et\u00a0al. 32 reported that endothelial dysfunction in patients with PCOS is independent\nfrom age and BMI. Obesity is an additional burden and a risk factor in PCOS, and is\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Cupisti et\u00a0al. 33 found that a high BMI (\u226525\u2009kg/m 2 ) was the main factor for\nendocrinological and metabolic disturbances in women with PCOS. Willis et\u00a0al. 27 found that plasma nitrite and nitrate levels were unaltered in women with\nPCOS compared with age- and BMI-matched controls. Consistent with previous studies, 32 our BMI and age subgroup analysis results were not significant. However,\nfurther research is required to determine the relationship between serum or plasma\nnitrite levels and obesity or BMI. There have been no studies on racial differences\nin NO levels across different ethnicities in women with PCOS. In our meta-analysis,\nthere was no obvious difference in nitrite levels between Asian and European\npopulations, but more studies in other ethnicities are required to evaluate if serum\nor plasma nitrite levels are influenced by ethnicity.  The relationship of PCOS with serum or plasma nitrite levels is controversial. Our\nmeta-analysis is the first to support a relation of PCOS with serum or plasma\nnitrite levels. However, there are some potential limitations of our meta-analysis\nthat should be considered when interpreting the results. First, despite that we\ninvestigated the source of heterogeneity, we only examined heterogeneity from the\npublication date because there was inadequate information and a limited amount of\nstudies. Second, the number of studies was generally insufficient and may have\naffected the precision of our outcomes. Further larger scale studies need to be\nperformed to confirm our results. Third, the outcomes may have been one-sided by\nvarious estimation methods and instruments used to identify serum or plasma nitrite\nlevels. Furthermore, plasma nitrite and nitrate levels reflect not only endogenous\nNO production, but also dietary nitrate ingestion. Magnesium and vitamin E can\nincrease plasma NO levels. 34 Therefore, dietary variables may have affected our findings. Additionally,\nplasma NO status may sometimes not reflect tissue NO status. Finally, we could only\ninclude studies in the English language because of difficulty in obtaining abstracts\nor full texts of articles published in other languages. Therefore, our results need\nconfirmation by further research and should be interpreted with caution.    Conclusions  Our meta-analysis shows that serum or plasma nitrite levels are reduced in patients\nwith PCOS. The pathogenesis of PCOS may be due to endothelial dysfunction, but\nfurther research on this issue is required in the future.",
