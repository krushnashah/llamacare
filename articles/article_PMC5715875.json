    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5%\u20108% of women of reproductive age. 1 This condition is characterized by a classical triad of hyperandrogenism, menstrual abnormalities, and polycystic ovaries. 2 , 3 Women with PCOS often exhibit the characteristics of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. 4   Patients with PCOS are at risk for premenopausal endometrial cancer (EC) and/or atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). Endometrial cancer is the fourth\u2010most common malignancy in women and the most common gynecological cancer in the US. 5 Approximately 25% of women with EC are premenopausal and 5% of all cases are diagnosed at under 40\u00a0years of age. 6 The important risk factors for EC and/or AEH often present in patients with PCOS, including obesity, nulliparity, infertility, hypertension, diabetes, chronic anovulation, and unopposed estrogen supplementation. 7 The mechanism by which EC and/or AEH develops in patients with PCOS involves not only chronic anovulation but also insulin resistance. 8 Patients with PCOS therefore could be at increased risk of developing EC and/or AEH, particularly when endometrial shedding is infrequent or absent due to ovulation irregularities. 7 , 9 A recent meta\u2010analysis has shown that patients with PCOS are approximately threefold more likely to develop EC, 10 , 11 but EC and/or AEH could be prevented in such patients if a diagnosis of PCOS is made early and appropriate interventions, including cyclic progestin therapy, are initiated in a timely manner. Therefore, the current study aimed to elucidate the risk of developing EC and/or AEH in patients with PCOS who are under 35\u00a0years of age and to identify preventive measures for this group.    2  Materials and Methods  Between January 2001 and December 2013, hospital records were used to identify a cohort of patients who were under 35\u00a0years of age, who had been diagnosed with EC and/or AEH, and who had been treated at Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan. A retrospective observational study was conducted. The clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis of EC and/or AEH, conservative treatment or hysterectomy, endocrine profiles, and menstrual history were assessed retrospectively from the medical records.  The study's participants were divided into two groups, a PCOS group and a non\u2010PCOS group, and PCOS was diagnosed by using the revised criteria that were proposed by the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) in 2007. 12 , 13 The patients who had been treated prior to the criteria undergoing this revision were re\u2010examined and the diagnosis of PCOS was reconfirmed. The clinical characteristics included the participants\u2019 age, parity, height, weight, menstruation regularity, and clinical stage of EC and/or AEH. The endocrine profiles included the plasma glucose, insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle\u2010stimulating hormone, free testosterone, and prolactin (PRL) levels. The effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) therapy (600\u00a0mg/d) and operation methods was assessed in the PCOS and non\u2010PCOS groups. \u201cIrregular\u201d menstruation was defined as shorter than 24\u00a0days or longer than 39\u00a0days. A statistical analysis was carried out by using the Student's t \u2010test or \u03c7 2 \u2010test where appropriate and P <.05 was taken as the threshold level of significance.    3  Results  From January 2001 to December 2013, 539 cases of EC and/or AEH were treated in Kumamoto University Hospital, of which 25 (4.6%) were under 35\u00a0years of age. Table 1 provides their clinical characteristics. There were 14 (56%) cases that met the diagnostic criteria for PCOS, as revised by JSOG in 2007. 12 , 13 The mean age was 29.0\u00a0years (median: 30; range: 22\u201034) and all the patients were nulligravida. The mean age at menarche was not statistically different between the PCOS group and the non\u2010PCOS group. The body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the PCOS group (33.9\u00b19.1 vs 25.0\u00b18.4\u00a0kg/m 2 , P =.019). Twenty\u2010two (88%) cases had irregular menstrual cycles (Table 1 ).

The free serum testosterone tended to be higher in the PCOS group (1.39\u00b10.7 vs 1.11\u00b10.3\u00a0pg/mL, P =.336) (Table 2 ). The PRL tended to be higher in the non\u2010PCOS group (18.4\u00b115.2 vs 41.9\u00b158.6\u00a0ng/mL, P =.222) (Table 2 ).

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd    The clinical stages of EC and/or AEH were identified as follows: AEH (five cases), stage IA (18 cases), IB (one case), and IIIA (one case) (Table 3 ). The five cases that were identified with AEH were all patients without PCOS. The number of patients who had undergone conservative therapy with MPA was six (43%) and nine (82%) in the PCOS group and the non\u2010PCOS group, respectively. In the PCOS group, MPA therapy was effective in two out of six (33%) cases, but eight out of nine (89%) cases in the non\u2010PCOS group ( P <.05) (Table 4 ). All the patients with stage IB and above underwent a hysterectomy. There were 13 and five cases of stage IA in the PCOS group and non\u2010PCOS group, respectively. When limited to stage IA, dilatation and curettage as a fertility\u2010sparing treatment was performed in only two out of 13 cases in the PCOS group, whereas four out of five patients in the non\u2010PCOS group underwent this procedure. When the operation method was compared between the two groups, it was clear that the non\u2010PCOS group participants were more likely to preserve their fecundity than the PCOS group participants ( P =.0007) (Table 5 ).

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd    Among the 25 participants, 22 (88%) exhibited a history of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. At the time of the EC and/or AEH diagnosis, all 14 patients with PCOS had oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, whereas eight out of 11 of the patients without PCOS had oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. In the PCOS group, 11 out of 14 cases had irregular menstruation or amenorrhea during their adolescent period. The mean duration of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea was 13.1\u00a0years (median: 16; range: 1\u201021) and 10.1\u00a0years (median: 10; range: 0\u201021) before been diagnosed with EC and/or AEH in the PCOS group and the non\u2010PCOS group, respectively ( P =.335) (Fig. 1 ).

Among the total number of patients with EC and/or AEH studied herein, 56% (14 out of 25) were diagnosed with PCOS according to the criteria that were proposed by JSOG. As PCOS is diagnosed in <10% of women of reproductive age, 1 the prevalence of PCOS is relatively high in patients with EC and/or AEH. There were significant differences in the BMI and HOMA\u2010IR between the patients with PCOS and the patients without PCOS. This is consistent with the fact that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with PCOS. 9   The serum PRL, however, was non\u2010significantly higher in the non\u2010PCOS group than in the PCOS group. As elevated serum PRL levels are one of the major causes of irregular menstruation and as PRL might be important in the development of early neoplastic transformation, such as endometrial hyperplasia, 15 it follows that hyperprolactinemia might be an independent risk factor for premenopausal EC and/or AEH in the study's non\u2010PCOS group.  When comparing the characteristics of EC and/or AEH by clinical stages and MPA therapy or surgical treatment between the PCOS group and the non\u2010PCOS group, it was apparent that the PCOS group did not have AEH and that the patients in this group were less likely to have MPA therapy and fertility\u2010sparing surgery, even in the same\u2010stage IA. This result supports the idea that obesity and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for premenopausal EC and/or AEH. 16   Chronic anovulation is one of the major risk factors for premenopausal EC and/or AEH. In the present study, 88% (22 out of 25) of the patients had irregular menstrual cycles that were suggestive of chronic anovulation. Although both the number of irregular menstruation cycles and the mean duration of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea were not significantly different between the PCOS and non\u2010PCOS groups, the PCOS group tended to have longer irregular menstruation or amenorrhea in their adolescent period. Therefore, this might be the reason for the PCOS group to be less likely to have fertility\u2010sparing surgery. However, the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is difficult because the features of early normal pubertal development and PCOS are often similar. 17 Ultrasonography is less practical for the diagnosis of polycystic ovaries in adolescent girls, as the ovarian appearance and volume can vary during adolescence and the trans\u2010vaginal modality is less preferred than the trans\u2010abdominal approach. 18 Although irregular menstrual cycles in the 5\u00a0years after menarche are physiological and no further clinical or endocrinological evaluation is suggested, 19 oligomenorrhea at age 18\u00a0years is better predicted by the pattern of menstrual cycles at the age of 15\u00a0years. 20 The diagnosis of PCOS is more difficult in the Asian population because hyperandrogenism is not as apparent as in the Caucasian population. Consequently, taking a menstrual history is likely to be the most powerful clue with which to diagnose PCOS. It has been suggested that anovulatory adolescents, even those who do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PCOS, should be followed up carefully and might be diagnosed at a later time. 21   In conclusion, PCOS is frequently found among patients with EC and/or AEH who are under 35\u00a0years of age. These patients are more often obese, insulin\u2010resistant, and less likely to have undergone fertility\u2010sparing surgery than are patients without PCOS because they had more advanced disease or failed to respond to MPA therapy. Patients with PCOS exhibit a year\u2010long duration of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea prior to the diagnosis of PCOS. Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital in the prevention of EC and/or AEH and in fertility preservation in patients with PCOS who are under 35\u00a0years of age.
