    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, complex condition that affects up to 18% of reproductive-\naged women, causing reproductive, metabolic and psychological dysfunctions. We performed an overview\nand appraisal of methodological quality of systematic reviews that assessed medical and surgical treatments\nfor reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL PLUS and\nPROSPERO) were searched on the 15th of September 2017. We included any systematic review that assessed\nthe effect of medical or surgical management of PCOS on reproductive, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.\nEligibility assessment, data extraction and quality assessment by the Assessing the Methodological Quality\nof Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool were performed in duplicate. We identified 53 reviews comprising\n44 reviews included in this overview; the majority were moderate to high quality. In unselected women with\nPCOS, letrozole was associated with a higher live birth rate than clomiphene citrate (CC), while CC was better\nthan metformin or placebo. In women with CC-resistant PCOS, gonadotrophins were associated with a higher\nlive birth rate than CC plus metformin, which was better than laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). LOD was\nassociated with lower multiple pregnancy rates than other medical treatments. In women with PCOS undergo-\ning in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), the addition of metformin to gonadotro-\nphins resulted in less ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and higher pregnancy and live birth rates\nthan gonadotrophins alone. Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist was associated with less\nOHSS, gonadotrophin units and shorter stimulation length than GnRH agonist. Letrozole appears to be a good\nfirst line treatment and gonadotrophins, as a second line treatment, for anovulatory women with PCOS. LOD\nresults in lower multiple pregnancy rates. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the included popula-\ntions of women with PCOS, further larger scale trials are needed with more precise assessment of treatments\naccording to heterogeneous variants of PCOS.",
    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most\nimportant dilemmas in reproductive medicine. PCOS is\na member of the World Health Organization group II\novulation disorders, and has a 9-18% prevalence among\nreproductive-aged women ( 1 ) and nearly 80% among\ninfertile anovulatory women ( 1 , 2 ). There is an ongoing\ndebate related to its definition, aetiology, diagnosis and\ntreatment for its clinical phenotypes ( 3 ). Since first described by Stein and Leventhal ( 4 ), a number of reports\nand meetings have suggested diagnostic criteria for this\ncondition ( 3 , 5 , 6 ). However, the criteria reported by\nESHRE/ASRM in Rotterdam in 2003 are most commonly used both in research and clinical care. These\ncriteria propose that two out of three domains should\nbe present to establish a diagnosis of PCOS. These\ndomains are: an-/oligo-ovulation, hyperandrogenism\n(clinical \u00b1 biochemical) and polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound examination, with exclusion of other\ncauses of hyperandrogenism ( 6 ). In 2012, the National\nInstitute of Health reinforced the need for identification of four phenotypes within the Rotterdam criteria\nin women with PCOS, which refer to the combination\nof diagnostic criteria ( 7 ). By using the possible combinations of these criteria, four different phenotypes of\nPCOS are now identified: i. Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) and chronic anovulation (H-CA),\nii. Hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (PCOm), but with ovulatory cycles (H-PCOm),\niii. Chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries without\nhyperandrogenism (CA-PCOm), and iv. Hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries\n(H-CA-PCOm). The identification of specific phenotypes in women with PCOS seems to be justified from\nthe metabolic point ( 3 ).  This heterogeneous condition manifests with many\nclinical presentations, including infertility, pregnancy complications, and psychological and metabolic\nfeatures. The reproductive problems associated with\nPCOS consist mainly of menstrual dysfunction, infertility and pregnancy complications. Many treatments\nare proposed by different guidelines for infertility with\nPCOS, and include clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole\nand gonadotrophins. However, there is a lack of clarity around the relative efficacy of these different treatments. Despite the agreement between most guidelines\nof the importance and priority of lifestyle modification\nin PCOS and weight loss, where women are overweight\nor obese, there are still limited studies that compare\nlifestyle modification and pharmacological drugs for\nreproductive outcomes ( 8 ). With regards to pharmacological treatment in isolation, CC is recommended\nas first-line treatment for ovulation induction (OI) in\ninfertile women with POCS with the alternative treatment, letrozole, which has encouraging results in many\nrecent trials ( 1 , 2 , 8 - 10 ). Although the insulin sensitizer\nmetformin has been recently recommended as a firstline treatment ( 11 ), its role and specific indication are\ncontroversial ( 1 - 3 ). The second-line treatment is usually recommended as gonadotrophins or laparoscopic\novarian drilling (LOD) ( 2 ). Additional issues relating\nto treatment of reproductive outcomes which are still\nsomewhat controversial include the best time to use in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection\n(IVF/ICSI) in women who failed to become pregnant\nafter pharmacological treatment, and the potential\nbenefit of modern techniques like in vitro maturation\n(IVM) ( 2 , 3 ).  The aim of this review was to perform an overview to\nsummarize and appraise the content, results and quality of\nsystematic reviews that assess medical or surgical treatments for reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS.    Materials and Methods   Inclusion criteria  The Participant, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes\nand Studies (PICOS) framework was used for this review.\nThis overview is part of a larger overview of systematic\nreviews. For this broader overview, we included any systematic review or meta-analysis where the assessment or\nmanagement of PCOS was the primary focus of the review, either as interventions in PCOS or a comparison of\nwomen with and without PCOS for a specific outcome.\nExclusion criteria were studies where PCOS was a secondary condition assessed as part of a broader topic. For\nthis specific overview, we included any systematic review\nthat assessed the effect of medical or surgical management of PCOS on reproductive outcomes. The specific inclusion criteria were: i. Published from 2009 onwards, as\nthis was the date of publication of the Preferred Reporting\nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement as a guideline for conducting systematic\nreviews ( 12 ), ii. Must have included a search strategy that\ncontained at least key words or terms, iii. Must include\nthe number of identified and included articles, and iv. The\nreview needed to conduct some form of quality appraisal\nof the articles. The comparisons term was not applicable\nin this review context. The outcomes assessed were reproductive outcomes, specifically live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, ovulation, multiple pregnancy, menstrual cycle frequency, follicular size, pregnancy related\noutcomes (gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia), neonatal outcomes, costs\nand side effects. Only articles published in English were\nincluded. The protocol is registered in the International\nProspective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO\n(CRD42016052649).    Article selection  A comprehensive database search was conducted on\nthe 17 th of October 2016, which was last updated on 15 th September 2017. The following electronic databases\nwere used to identify relevant published literature: Medline in-process and other non-indexed citations [Ovid\nMEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)\n1946 to Present]; EMBASE (EBM Reviews- Cochrane\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews 2005 to September 15,\n2017, EBM Reviews- ACP Journal Club 1991 to September 2017, EBM Reviews- Database of Abstracts\nof Reviews of Effects 1 st Quarter 2016, EBM Reviews- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials September 2017, EBM Reviews- Cochrane Methodology\nRegister 3 rd Quarter 2012, EBM Reviews- Health Technology Assessment 4 th Quarter 2016, EBM Reviews-\nNHS Economic Evaluation Database 1 st Quarter 2016);\nand CINAHL PLUS. The search strategy is documented\nin Supplementary Appendix 1 (See Supplementary On line Information at www.celljournal.org). This search was\nmodified for EMBASE and CINAHL using their subject headings instead of the MeSH subject headings. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews\nPROSPERO ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ )\nwas additionally searched on the 15 th September 2017\nusing the key words \u201cPCOS\u201d or \u201cpolycystic ovary syndrome\u201d. In addition, experts in the field were asked to\nprovide any potentially relevant studies for consideration.\nTwo independent reviewers, who were not blinded to the\nnames of investigators or sources of publication, identified and selected the articles that met the inclusion criteria\n(L.J.M, D.H or C.T.T). Disagreements between reviewers\nwere discussed and resolved by consensus or arbitration\nwith a third reviewer.    Data extraction  All eligible systematic reviews included were examined\nand extracted independently by two reviewers (L.J.M,\nM.G or C.T.T). Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus or arbitration with a third reviewer.\nThe data extracted included information on author(s),\nyear, country of author, inclusion criteria, study methodology, study outcomes, number of studies identified, number of participants in the review, whether a meta-analysis\nwas conducted, and quality of identified articles in each\nreview (as reported by the systematic review authors as\noverall quality of the entire study or evidence or reported\nas unclear if not summarized by the systematic review authors).    Data synthesis  A narrative description of the included reviews was performed. We presented results per reproductive outcome.    Quality assessment of systematic reviews  All included reviews were evaluated by two independent reviewers (L.J.M, M.G or C.T.T) using the Assessing\nthe Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool ( 13 , 14 ). Disagreements were discussed and\nresolved by consensus or arbitration with a third reviewer. The AMSTAR tool contains 11 items to appraise the\nmethodological aspects of the systematic reviews. Each\nitem was scored 1 for \u201cyes\u201d and 0 for \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d with a total score range from 0 to 11. The methodological quality for each review was classified as low [\u2264 3],\nmoderate [4-7] and high [8-11] ( 15 ) .     Results   Characteristics of included reviews  The search yielded 978 citations, with 60 citations identified from PROSPERO and one citation identified from\nexpert assessors, for a total of 1039 citations. There were\n831 citations that remained after removal of duplicates.\nBased on a priori selection criteria, screening for title or\nabstract identified 276 articles for assessment of the full\ntext. Of these, 128 articles were excluded for the following: not conducting quality assessment, not in English,\nno search terms detailed or no identified search strategy\n(Supplementary Appendix 2) (See Supplementary Online\nInformation at www.celljournal.org ). We included 139\nfull-text articles for our final analysis, of which 53 articles\nwere related to the theme of medical or surgical treatment\non reproductive outcomes in PCOS, with the remaining\neligible articles assessed in separate overviews of systematic reviews and excluded from this specific review. These\n53 articles comprised 44 reviews ( Fig .1 ).   Fig 1   Study selection.     The characteristics of these reviews are summarized\nin Supplementary Appendix 3 (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org ). The number\nof included studies in each review ranged between none\n( 16 , 17 ) and 66 ( 18 ). The type of included studies in each\nreview was only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in\n22 reviews ( 16 , 18 - 38 ), RCTs and crossover trials until\nfirst inclusion in 11 reviews ( 17 , 33 , 39 - 47 ), RCTs and\nsystematic reviews of RCTs in two reviews ( 48 , 49 ), any\nstudy design in two reviews ( 50 , 51 ), any study with control group in three reviews ( 52 - 54 ), RCTs and prospective studies in one review ( 55 ) and not stated in three reviews ( 56 - 58 ). Participants in the included reviews were\ntreatment-naive women in two reviews ( 27 , 28 ), women\nresistant to CC in six reviews ( 19 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 33 , 56 ),\nwomen whose treatment status was undefined in 32 reviews ( 16 - 18 , 20 - 22 , 24 - 26 , 30 , 31 , 35 - 42 , 44 - 51 , 55 , 57 , 59 ), pregnant women with PCOS in four reviews ( 52 - 54 , 58 ), adolescents with PCOS (11-19 years old) in one review ( 34 ), and women with PCOS not trying to conceive\nin one review ( 43 ). Twenty-two reviews were conducted\naccording to prior guidelines for conducting systematic reviews such as PRISMA, Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE), Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUORUMS) or Cochrane ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 29 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 39 - 46 , 50 , 51 , 58 , 59 ).\nMeta-analyses were performed in 39 reviews ( 18 - 32 , 34 - 43 , 45 - 50 , 52 - 59 ). The systematic reviews did not apply\nlanguage restrictions in 28 reviews ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 24 - 26 , 28 , 29 , 34 , 36 , 38 - 47 , 50 , 53 - 56 , 58 , 59 ), restricted the\nsearch to articles in English in 12 reviews ( 18 , 21 , 22 , 27 , 32 , 33 , 35 , 37 , 48 , 49 , 52 , 57 ), restricted the search to articles in English and Chinese in two reviews ( 30 , 31 ) and\ndid not state if language restrictions were applied in two\nreviews ( 23 , 51 ). The quality of included studies in each\nreview was not reported by authors or was not able to be\neasily interpreted in 31 reviews ( 16 , 17 , 20 - 29 , 32 , 36 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 43 , 45 - 47 , 50 - 59 ), low or insufficient in eight\nreviews ( 18 , 31 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 44 ), low to moderate\nin two reviews ( 19 , 48 ) and low to high in three reviews\n( 30 , 33 , 49 )    Quality of included reviews  The quality of the included reviews are presented in\nSupplementary Appendix 4 (See Supplementary Online Information at www.celljournal.org ). Seven reviews were of low quality ( 28 , 30 , 33 , 36 , 51 , 52 , 58 ),\n22 reviews were of moderate quality ( 16 , 20 - 27 , 31 , 32 , 35 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 50 , 53 - 57 , 59 ) and 15 reviews were of\nhigh quality ( 17 - 19 , 29 , 34 , 39 , 41 - 49 ). Twenty reviews\nhad pre-specified their clinical question and inclusion\ncriteria ( 16 - 19 , 29 , 33 , 34 , 39 - 49 , 55 , 59 ). Nineteen reviews conducted study selection and data extraction in\nduplicate ( 17 - 19 , 21 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 32 , 34 , 37 , 39 , 42 - 45 , 50 , 55 , 57 ). Twenty-eight reviews conducted a\ncomprehensive literature search ( 16 - 19 , 21 , 24 - 26 , 28 - 31 , 34 , 38 - 49 , 53 , 54 , 59 ). Twenty reviews included\ngrey literature searches ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 25 , 26 , 29 , 34 , 38 - 47 , 53 , 54 , 59 ). Twenty-four reviews listed included\nand excluded studies ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 23 - 27 , 29 , 32 , 34 , 38 , 39 , 41 - 46 , 48 - 50 , 57 , 59 ). Forty reviews described the\ncharacteristics of the included studies ( 18 - 29 , 32 - 59 ).\nThirty-eight reviews assessed study quality ( 16 - 27 , 29 - 35 , 37 - 50 , 54 , 56 , 57 , 59 , 60 ). Nineteen reviews used\nthe scientific quality of their included studies in formulating results ( 18 , 20 - 22 , 24 , 25 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 35 , 39 , 40 , 45 - 49 , 57 ). Thirty-seven reviews combined the\nstudies using appropriate methods ( 18 - 32 , 35 - 43 , 45 , 46 , 48 - 50 , 52 - 59 ). Twenty-two reviews addressed the\nrisk of reporting bias, and used a statistical test where\nappropriate ( 16 - 19 , 32 , 34 , 35 , 37 - 39 , 41 - 44 , 46 , 47 , 50 , 52 , 53 , 55 , 56 , 58 ). Seven reviews addressed the\npotential for conflict of interest ( 16 , 17 , 29 , 43 , 47 - 49 ).    Types of interventions   Letrozole  Six reviews (three high quality ( 19 , 39 , 49 ) and three\nmoderate quality ( 20 , 27 , 32 ) assessed interventions that\ncontained letrozole, comprising a total of 89 trials and 14\n008 participants. Of these, five assessed letrozole \u00b1 other\nOI drugs versus OI drugs, including letrozole alone ( 20 , 27 , 32 , 39 , 49 ) and one assessed letrozole versus LOD\n( 19 ). The populations studied were women with PCOS\nwho were treatment-na\u00efve ( 27 ), CC resistant ( 32 ), or\ntreatment-na\u00efve \u00b1 CC resistant or unknown treatment status ( 20 , 39 , 49 ).  The meta-analyses reported statistically significant results for higher live birth, pregnancy and ovulation after\nletrozole compared to CC followed by timed intercourse\nin overall women with PCOS, and higher live birth and\npregnancy after letrozole in women with PCOS and body\nmass index (BMI) >25 kg/m 2 ( 20 , 27 , 39 , 49 ). In women\nwith CC resistance, letrozole with or without metformin\nresulted in higher live births compared to CC with metformin ( 32 , 39 ), letrozole resulted in higher pregnancy\nand ovulation than anastrozole and higher ovulation\nthan LOD ( 49 ). Long-term letrozole (10 days) resulted\nin higher pregnancy than short-term letrozole (5 days)\n(Tables 1 , 2 ) ( 49 ).

One review assessed CC versus LOD ( 19 ).\nOne review assessed early follicular versus late luteal CC\nadministration ( 36 ). The remaining 14 reviews assessed\nCC \u00b1 other OI drugs such as metformin, inositol, N-acetyl\ncysteine (NAC) and others versus other OI drugs, including CC. The populations studied were women with PCOS\nwho were treatment-na\u00efve ( 27 ), CC resistant ( 19 , 32 , 33 )\nand women with PCOS who were treatment-na\u00efve \u00b1 CC\nresistant PCOS or unknown treatment status.  The meta-analyses reported in overall women with\nPCOS that CC compared to placebo had statistically\nhigher pregnancy and ovulation ( 46 ). Early follicular CC\nhad higher pregnancy than late luteal CC ( 46 ) but with\nless mature follicles ( 36 ). Higher live birth, pregnancy,\nand ovulation resulted after CC compared to metformin\nmainly in women with BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ( 28 , 30 , 41 ) while\nmetformin resulted in higher pregnancy than CC in women with BMI <30 kg/m 2 ( 41 ). CC plus metformin was of\nmore benefit than CC or metformin alone with regards to\nlive birth ( 24 ), pregnancy and ovulation, but had higher\ngastrointestinal side effects ( 24 , 28 , 30 , 33 , 41 ). Higher\nlive birth and pregnancy resulted after gonadotrophins\ncompared to CC and 10 days of CC compared to 5 days of\nCC, respectively ( 46 ).  In women with CC resistant PCOS, gonadotrophins\nresulted in statistically higher live birth, pregnancy and\novulation than CC plus metformin ( 32 , 46 ) which, in turn,\nresulted in higher live birth than LOD ( 19 ). In the same\npopulation of women, the addition of dexamethasone,\nNAC or contraceptive pills to CC resulted in higher live\nbirths, pregnancy and ovulation than CC alone ( 46 , 47 ).\nFurthermore, the addition of metformin to CC resulted in\nmore favourable outcomes compared with the addition of\nNAC with regards to pregnancy and ovulation. However,\nthe cost of treatment was greater for gonadotrophins followed by LOD then CC plus metformin ( 19 ).    Gonadotrophins  Ten reviews [six high quality ( 19 , 29 , 39 , 45 , 46 , 49 ) and\nfour moderate quality ( 23 , 32 , 40 , 59 )] assessed interventions containing gonadotrophins, which comprised 146\ntrials with 18 379 participants. Two reviews assessed gonadotrophins versus LOD ( 19 , 23 ). Three reviews assessed\nthe effectiveness of adding metformin to gonadotrophins\nduring OI ( 40 , 45 ) and IVF ( 59 ). Two reviews assessed\ngonadotrophins versus anti-oestrogens \u00b1 adjunctive drugs\n( 32 , 46 ). Two reviews assessed gonadotrophins versus\naromatase inhibitors ( 39 , 49 ). One review assessed the effectiveness of different types of gonadotrophins ( 29 ). The\npopulations studied were women with CC resistant PCOS\n( 19 , 23 , 29 , 32 ) and women who were treatment-na\u00efve \u00b1\nCC resistant PCOS women or unknown treatment status.  The meta-analyses reported that in women with CC\nresistant PCOS, gonadotrophins resulted in statistically higher live births, multiple pregnancies, and costs of\nshort- and long-term treatment in comparison to LOD\n( 19 , 23 ) and higher live births, pregnancy and ovulation\nin comparison to CC \u00b1 metformin ( 32 , 46 ), but lower\npregnancy in comparison to letrozole ( 39 ). Adding metformin to gonadotrophins, compared to gonadotrophins\nalone, resulted in higher live birth and pregnancy in OI\n( 40 , 45 ) and higher live birth, implantation rate, lower\nmiscarriage, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nand number of oocyte retrieved in IVF ( 59 ). Recombinant\nfollicle stimulating hormone (FT.) resulted in lower dose\nand stimulation duration than other urinary gonadotrophins in OI ( 29 ).    Insulin sensitizers  Thirty reviews (12 reviews of high quality ( 18 , 19 , 34 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 44 - 49 ), 13 reviews of moderate quality ( 16 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 32 , 35 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 53 , 54 , 59 ) and five\nreviews of low quality ( 28 , 30 , 33 , 52 , 58 ) assessed interventions that contained insulin sensitizers comprising\n398 trials with 45 031 participants. Four reviews assessed\nmetformin versus placebo ( 18 , 21 , 41 , 42 ). Four reviews\nassessed metformin during pregnancy ( 52 - 54 , 58 ). One\nreview assessed the effect of pre-gestational metformin\non risk of miscarriage ( 25 ). One review assessed roziglitazone, plioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol versus placebo\n( 41 ). One review assessed metformin versus thiazolidinediones ( 22 ). One review assessed LOD versus metformin\n( 19 ). One review assessed NAC versus placebo or metformin ( 47 ). One review assessed oral contraceptive pills\nversus metformin ( 34 ). One review assessed the benefit\nof adding vitamin D to metformin ( 37 ).Three reviews had\nCC resistant PCOS women as participants ( 19 , 32 , 33 )\nwhile the others did not clarify the treatment status.  The meta-analyses reported that, overall in women with\nPCOS, metformin resulted in higher live births, pregnancy,\nand gastrointestinal side effects with lower OHSS than placebo when used in addition to IVF ( 18 , 21 , 42 ) and higher\npregnancy, ovulation, side effects and menstrual frequency\nin OI ( 41 ). Metformin had higher gastrointestinal side effects than thiazolidinediones ( 22 ). In women with CC resistant PCOS, NAC resulted in higher live births, pregnancy\nand ovulation than placebo, but lower pregnancy and ovulation than metformin ( 47 ). Oral contraceptive pills were\nbetter than metformin in improving menstrual frequency\n( 34 ). Adding vitamin D to metformin improved menstrual\nfrequency than metformin alone ( 37 ). Inositol resulted in\nhigher pregnancy than placebo with more benefit of myoinositol over D-chiro inositol in IVF ( 18 ), while inositol resulted in higher ovulation than placebo in OI. Roziglitaone,\npioglitazone and inositol improved menstrual frequency in\nOI ( 38 ). In women with PCOS who became pregnant, metformin intake during pregnancy resulted in higher live birth\nand lower miscarriage, preterm labour, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and intrauterine\ngrowth retardation ( 52 - 54 , 58 ).    Laparoscopic ovarian drilling  Six reviews [four high quality ( 19 , 32 , 39 , 49 ) and two\nmoderate quality ( 23 , 56 )] assessed ovarian ablation therapy and LOD as an intervention in PCOS comprising 97\ntrials with 13 617 participants. Three reviews had participants as CC resistant PCOS ( 19 , 23 , 56 ).  The meta-analyses reported that LOD resulted in lower\nlive births than CC plus metformin and gonadotrophins,\nrespectively ( 19 , 23 ), higher pregnancy than metformin\nalone ( 19 ), lower ovulation than letrozole ( 49 ), higher\ncosts than CC plus metformin but lower than gonadotrophins ( 19 ) and lower multiple pregnancy rate than other\nmedical treatments ( 19 ). Pregnancy and ovulation were\nhigher in lean women (BMI <25 kg/m 2 ) with CC resistant\nPCOS than in overweight and obese women (BMI \u226525\nkg/m 2 ) undergoing LOD ( 56 ).    Intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection related interventions  Nine reviews [three high quality ( 17 , 18 , 42 )] and six\nmoderate quality ( 21 , 26 , 31 , 50 , 57 , 59 ) assessed different interventions in women with PCOS undergoing\nassisted reproductive techniques [intrauterine insemination (IUI), IVF/ICSI] comprising 126 trials with 12 298\nparticipants in eight reviews and 333 cycles in the ninth\nreview which did not report on the number of participants\n( 57 ). Three reviews assessed gonadotrophin releasing\nhormone (GnRH) antagonist as an adjuvant intervention in controlled ovarian stimulation plus IUI ( 57 ) and\nin comparison with GnRH agonist during IVF/ICSI ( 26 , 31 ). Three reviews assessed the effect of metformin during IVF/ICSI ( 21 , 42 , 59 ). Two reviews assessed the use\nof IVM ( 17 , 50 ).  The meta-analyses reported statistically significant results for lower progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH)\nand premature luteinisation rate during IUI after GnRH\nantagonist ( 57 ) and lesser dose, duration of gonadotrophins and OHSS rate after GnRH antagonist during lVF/\nICSI . Metformin compared to placebo in IVF resulted\nin higher live births ( 18 , 59 ), pregnancy ( 18 , 42 ), lower\nmiscarriage ( 59 ), lower OHSS ( 18 , 21 , 42 , 59 ), and lower\noestradiol (E2), gonadotrophin dose and higher implantation rate ( 59 ); however, disadvantages included more, yet\nmild, gastrointestinal side effects ( 42 ). Compared to placebo, inositol resulted in higher pregnancy with better results after myoinositol than D-Chiro inositol, while mannitol resulted in lower OHSS ( 18 ). IVM used in women\nwith PCOS had higher pregnancy, lower cancelled cycles,\nhigher implantation but lower mature oocytes than IVM\nin non-PCOS patients ( 50 ).    Other interventions  A low quality review reported that bariatric surgery\nimproved menstrual frequency in women with PCOS in\nsix trials and 264 participants ( 51 ). A high quality review\nreported that statins did not improve menstrual frequency\nor ovulation in women with PCOS not trying to conceive\nin four trials and 244 participants ( 43 ). A high quality review ( 44 ) assessed the use of antidepressants in women\nwith PCOS, and identified no studies reporting on any of\nthe primary reproductive outcomes with the exception of\none RCT that reported on endocrine and metabolic outcomes between fluoxetine with sibutramine found no significant difference between both drugs ( 61 ). A moderate\nquality review assessed orlistat versus other anti-obesity\ndrugs and found no difference in reproductive outcomes\n( 55 ).     Discussion  We reported the first overview of systematic reviews\non treatment for reproductive outcomes in women with\nPCOS. This review follows a process of systematic reviews proposed by the Cochrane collaboration that summarizes evidence from more than one systematic review\nof different interventions for the same condition ( 62 , 63 ).\nThis type of review can be utilized as a rich source of data\nsynthesis for developing and updating guidelines, and\nfor health care policy makers. Our overview included 53\nsystematic reviews (9 older versions and 44 currently updated articles), 498 studies, and 56\u2009057 participants. The\nquality of most included reviews was moderate to high,\nalthough the quality of included studies was variable.  Our results align with most current guidelines on PCOS.\nAccording to many guidelines, treatment of anovulation\nin PCOS should start with lifestyle modification before\ncommencing pharmacological agents, especially in obese\nwomen with BMI >30 kg/m 2 ( 1 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 11 ), The firstline pharmacological agent is usually CC ( 2 , 3 , 11 , 64 , 65 )\nand some guidelines propose letrozole as an alternative\n( 1 , 8 , 10 ). Our results suggest that, overall, in women with\nPCOS (with or without CC resistance), letrozole resulted\nin higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates than other\nOI drugs, especially CC. This is consistent with many reviews and RCTs ( 9 , 20 , 27 , 32 , 39 , 49 , 66 - 68 ), despite the\nfact that letrozole is an off-label drug in OI. Nevertheless,\nthe issue of safety in pregnancy for both CC and letrozole\nhas not been completely resolved. Most large retrospective studies found no evidence of any difference between\nthese drugs ( 69 ). Metformin is recommended in many\nguidelines as an adjunctive treatment with CC in women\nwith glucose intolerance and in obese women ( 1 - 3 , 8 , 10 ),\nwhile the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Guidance (NICE) recommended metformin alone or\nwith CC as a first-line treatment ( 11 ). Our results suggest\nthat, overall, in women with PCOS, CC plus metformin\nalso resulted in in better reproductive outcomes than CC\nor metformin alone. The Australian National Health and\nMedical Research Council (NHMRC) evidence-based\nguidelines suggested that it is acceptable to use gonadotrophins as a first-line treatment ( 8 ). Our results suggest\nthat the use of gonadotrophins resulted in higher live birth\nand clinical pregnancy rates than CC, overall, in women\nwith PCOS.  CC is usually used for six months, which is recommended by many guidelines ( 1 , 8 , 11 ). After that, women are considered to be CC resistant, which necessitates\na second-line treatment. Most fertility guidelines recommend low dose gonadotrophins or LOD as a second-line\ntreatment ( 1 - 3 , 8 , 10 , 11 ). CC plus metformin was also\nrecommended by some guidelines, if not already used\nas a first-line treatment ( 8 , 11 ). Gonadotrophins have\nthe disadvantage of cost and increased rates of multiple pregnancies, while LOD has a risk with anaesthesia,\ndecreased ovarian reserve, and the need to use adjuvant\ndrugs for OI after surgery ( 3 ). Our results suggest that,\nin women with CC resistant PCOS, gonadotrophins resulted in better reproductive outcomes than many OI\ndrugs with the disadvantages of increased multiple pregnancies and increased cost ( 19 , 23 , 32 , 46 ). We found\nthat women who used gonadotrophins had higher live\nbirth than those who were prescribed CC plus metformin\nor LOD respectively, and higher clinical pregnancy and\novulation rates than CC plus metformin. CC plus metformin resulted in higher live birth rate and lower cost\nthan LOD. Gonadotrophins are more expensive than\nLOD. LOD has the advantage of lower rates of multiple pregnancies compared to other interventions, such\nas gonadotrophins, in CC resistant PCOS ( 19 ). LOD in\nlean women seem to have better reproductive outcomes\nthan in overweight and obese women.  Current recommendations state that IVF should be used\nin case of CC failure, which is defined by failure of conception after 6-9 months ( 1 , 11 ). Our results support the\ncurrent evidence for use of GnRH antagonists and addition of metformin to GnRH agonist to decrease OHSS ( 1 ).\nThere is lack of data on use of IVM in PCOS ( 1 ), which\nis reported by one of included reviews ( 17 ). Another review by the same author reported higher pregnancy and\nimplantation rates with lower cancellation rate in women\nwith PCOS undergoing IVM compared to IVM in nonPCOS women ( 50 ).  Despite the large number of reviews and RCTs that have\nbeen conducted assessing different treatments for management of reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS,\nthere are still a considerable number of research gaps.\nRecently, the international evidence-based guideline for\nthe assessment and management of PCOS has issued new\nrecommendations for the diagnosis and management of\nPCOS( 70 ). These guidelines state that letrozole should\nbe considered first-line pharmacological treatment for OI\nin women with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no\nother infertility factors to improve ovulation, pregnancy\nand live birth rates. This is consistent with our results in\nthis overview. They also stated that inositol (in any form)\nshould currently be considered an experimental therapy in\nPCOS, with emerging evidence on efficacy highlighting\nthe need for further research ( 70 ). Furthermore, research\non the possible reasons for CC resistance and failure utilizing unified definitions is needed. This is particularly\nrelevant given that some recent reviews revealed that the\nantiestrogenic effect of CC, specifically on endometrial\ntissue, is not enough rationale for resistance and failure\n( 66 ). Furthermore, a recent crossover RCT found that\nthere is no difference in clinical pregnancy and live birth\nrates between CC and letrozole when used as a second\nline treatment in women who failed to ovulate or conceive with CC or letrozole as first line of treatment ( 9 ).\nIt is also important to note that a thorough study of the\ncost effectiveness of any of these treatments has not been\nperformed, particularly in low income countries. Further\ninvestigation of metformin with regards to its cost effectiveness, safety, and effectiveness in non-obese women is\nalso needed ( 1 , 8 ). There is also a lack of data relating\nto the comparison between the use of LOD and medical\ntreatment as a first line treatment, and the minimum efficient dose of LOD to induce ovulation without affecting\novarian reserve ( 1 , 3 , 11 ).  Limitations include our search strategy with reviews published from 2009 onwards, coinciding with the PRISMA\nstatement publication for conducting systematic reviews.\nWhile this would miss earlier reviews, later included reviews would be likely to be of higher quality and aligned\nwith the PRISMA statement. We applied language restrictions including only articles in English, which might lead\nto bias in exclusion of other languages. We found insufficient data on the quality of included studies in each review. We did not perform a quality assessment of each\nof the individual trials within each systematic review\nand relied instead on the judgement of the authors which\nvaried from cursory to comprehensive; although we note\nthat performing a quality assessment of 498 total studies\nwould have been an extensive task. We note that the actual effect of different treatments in each treatment status\nand PCOS phenotypes is still unclear. We also note wide\nvariability in the definition of outcomes across reviews\nand included studies. For instance, although pregnancy\nwas reported as clinical pregnancy in most included reviews, ongoing pregnancy was reported in some reviews\n( 26 , 45 ) and pregnancy was not predefined in others ( 22 , 24 , 36 , 40 , 51 , 56 ). The definition of clinical pregnancy\nvaried across the included studies within each review.    Conclusion  We report here a significant contribution to the literature in the overview and synthesis of systematic reviews\nthat assessed medical and surgical treatments for reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS. In agreement\nwith most recent international guidelines on management\nof PCOS, letrozole was superior to other OI agents as a\nfirst-line pharmacological treatment with gonadotrophins\na second-line pharmacological treatment for anovulatory\nwomen with PCOS.
