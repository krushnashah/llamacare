    "abstract": "It is well known that both women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but little is known whether the combination of these two conditions exacerbates the risks. We explored risk estimates for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with either PCOS or GDM and the combination of both PCOS and GDM. Nationwide register\u2010based historical cohort study in Sweden including women who gave birth to singleton infants during 1997\u20132015 ( Based on non\u2010significant PCOS by GDM interaction analyses, we found no evidence that having PCOS adds any extra risk beyond that of having GDM for maternal and neonatal outcomes. For example, the adjusted odds ratio for preeclampsia in women with PCOS\u2010only were 1.18 (95% CI 1.11\u20131.26), for GDM\u2010only 1.77 (95% CI 1.45\u20132.15), and for women with PCOS and GDM 1.86 (95% CI 1.46\u20132.36). Corresponding adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth in women with PCOS\u2010only were 1.34 (95% CI 1.28\u20131.41), GDM\u2010only 1.64 (95% CI 1.39\u20131.93), and for women with PCOS and GDM 2.08 (95% CI 1.67\u20132.58). Women with PCOS had an increased risk of stillbirth compared with the control group (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.29\u20131.80), whereas no increased risk was noted in women with GDM (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.24\u20131.39). The combination of PCOS and GDM adds no extra risk beyond that of having GDM alone, for a number of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, PCOS is still an unrecognized risk factor in pregnancy, exemplified by the increased risk of stillbirth. Women with PCOS have increased risk of a number of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, but having the combination of PCOS and GDM does not exacerbate the risk associated with GDM.",

Thus, this study aims to investigate pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among women with either PCOS\u2010only, GDM\u2010only or the combination of PCOS and GDM and estimate the risks.    2  MATERIAL AND METHODS   2.1  Data sources  This study obtained data from five Swedish national registries linked through unique personal identity number.  15  The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare provided information on the National Patient Register, the Medical Birth Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. Statistics Sweden supplied information on the Education Register and the Total Population Register. The National Patient Register contains data on diagnoses and dates of in\u2010patient hospital visits since 1964 and specialized outpatient visits, including visits to a gynecologist or reproductive specialist, since 2001. Diagnoses are classified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, version 10 (ICD\u201010), since 1997.  16  In addition, the Medical Birth Register covers over 98% of births in Sweden since 1973. It includes information on women's reproductive history and complications during pregnancy, delivery and the neonatal period (classified by ICD\u2010codes when applicable).  17    The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register contains data on drug prescriptions, including Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes, daily doses and dates of filled prescriptions of drugs since 1 July 2005.  18  The Education Register provides information on the highest completed level of education since 1985, while the Total Population Register provides details on country of birth and residential municipality.  19      2.2  Study population and exposure  The study population consisted of women born between 1950 and 1999. For each woman with PCOS, five non\u2010PCOS women, matched for age and geographic area at the time of PCOS diagnosis, were randomly selected as controls. Out of these, women with a singleton delivery after 22 completed gestational weeks and registered in the Medical Birth Register between the years 1997 and 2015 were included in the study population.  The PCOS group consisted of women with the diagnoses PCOS (E28.2), androgen excess from the ovary (E28.1) and anovulatory infertility (N97.0) in the National Patient Register between 1997 and 2017. Since PCOS is a chronic condition, and thus, the assumption was made that women with PCOS had their condition already at the start of the study period, that is, independently of whether they were diagnosed before or after their pregnancies.  3  We included anovulatory infertility among the PCOS diagnoses since PCOS accounts for approximately 80%\u201395% of infertility cases due to anovulation. 20 , 21 During the first years of the study period, PCOS was diagnosed according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, which require the presence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and chronic oligo\u2010 or anovulation.  22  From 2003 and onwards, most clinicians used the Rotterdam criteria, which added polycystic ovary morphology on ultrasound as an additional criterion. According to the Rotterdam criteria, two out of three of the following criteria must be fulfilled: polycystic ovary morphology, oligo\u2010 or anovulation or hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical.  4  We excluded all women diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, primary ovarian insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Further, as PCOS is underdiagnosed and may be hidden among the non\u2010PCOS women, we excluded women with pregnancies achieved by ovarian stimulation from the non\u2010PCOS group.  Diabetes mellitus was identified by ICD\u201010 diagnoses given at discharge from the hospital after delivery. The study population was categorized as diagnosed with GDM, pre\u2010gestational diabetes (diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2) and no diabetic disease (Supporting Information Table S1 ). Women with pre\u2010gestational diabetes were excluded from the study population. During the study period the decision to screen for GDM, in most regions in Sweden, was based on known risk factors and a random capillary blood glucose \u22658\u2009mmol/L or plasma glucose \u22659\u2009mmol/L. Diagnosis of GDM was based on the result of a 75\u2009g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among those screened. No national consensus regarding GDM screening and diagnosing was in place in Sweden during the study period, resulting in varying cut\u2010off values across regions within the country. The main diagnostic criteria for GDM during the study period were fasting venous plasma \u22657.0\u2009mmol/L and a 2\u2009h cut\u2010off value after OGTT \u226510.0\u2009mmol/L. 23 , 24   The final study population included 158\u2009638 women with 281\u2009806 singleton births. Participants could be included in the study population several times if they had delivered more than once during the study period. Women were categorized as having PCOS\u2010only, GDM\u2010only and the combination of PCOS and GDM. The flow chart of the study population is presented in Figure 1 .   FIGURE 1   Flow chart of the study population. PCOS, Polycystic ovary syndrome defined as a diagnosis of PCOS, hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin or anovulatory infertility in the Patient register 1997\u20132017. GDM, Gestational diabetes mellitus.       2.3  Outcomes  Maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted from the Medical Birth Register and identified according to ICD\u201010 diagnosis (Table S1 ).  Maternal outcomes assessed were gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage and obstetric anal sphincter injury. Gestational hypertension was defined as newly onset hypertension (systolic blood pressure\u2009\u2265140\u2009mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure\u2009\u2265\u200990\u2009mmHg measured at two subsequent occasions at least 4\u2009h apart) after 20\u2009weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia was defined as new onset hypertension and proteinuria (\u2265300\u2009mg/24\u2009h), superimposed preeclampsia and eclampsia were included as preeclampsia. Postpartum hemorrhage was defined as bleeding exceeding 1000\u2009mL. Obstetrical anal sphincter injury included third\u2010 and fourth\u2010degree perineal lacerations.  Neonatal outcomes explored were preterm birth, stillbirth, shoulder dystocia, SGA, LGA, macrosomia, Apgar score\u2009<7 at 5\u2009min, infant birth trauma, cerebral impact of the infant, neonatal hypoglycemia, meconium aspiration syndrome and infant respiratory distress. Preterm birth was defined as delivery before 37 completed gestational weeks. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as a preterm birth with a spontaneous onset of labor, including spontaneous premature rupture of membranes. Stillbirth was defined as fetal death before or during labor (after 28 completed weeks prior to July 2008 and after 22\u2009weeks onwards). SGA and LGA were defined as infants with birthweight above or below two standard deviations (+/\u20102SD) from the mean weight for gestational age and sex according to the Swedish intrauterine growth reference range.  25  Macrosomia was defined as birthweight \u22654500\u2009g. Apgar score is registered at 1, 5 and 10\u2009min after birth, among which we chose to report on Apgar score\u2009<7 at 5\u2009min. Neonatal hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose <2.6\u2009mmol/L at least 3\u2009h after birth and identified by ICD\u201010 codes. Infant birth trauma was defined as injury to the skeleton, peripheral and central nervous system and retinal hemorrhage. Cerebral impact of the infant included any of the following diagnoses: Intracranial lacerations and hemorrhage, intrauterine hypoxia, convulsions, other disturbances of cerebral status and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (Table S1 ).    2.4  Covariates  The following covariates were collected from the Medical Birth Register: Maternal age, maternal weight, height, involuntary childlessness before the present pregnancy, assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment, cigarette smoking during pregnancy and year of delivery.  Maternal age was recorded at the time of delivery. Maternal weight and height were recorded at the first antenatal visit (usually gestational week 7\u201310) and were either measured or self\u2010reported. Early pregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the equation weight (kg) / height (m) 2 . Cigarette smoking during pregnancy was self\u2010reported at the time of the first antenatal visit and/or at gestational week 30\u201332. Involuntary childlessness and conception through ovulation induction or ART treatment were self\u2010reported and recorded in checkboxes by midwives.  Information on country of birth and years of formal education was collected from the Total Population Register and the Education Register, respectively.  Metformin use was identified by the ATC code A10BA02 after linkage to the Prescribed Drug Register and defined as at least two filled prescriptions within 3\u2009months before conception and through the first trimester.  The covariates were categorized as presented in Table 1 .   TABLE 1   Maternal characteristics in a cohort of women giving birth in Sweden 1997\u20132015.

Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR and aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the generalized estimation equation method as observations were not independent in women giving birth more than once during the study period. Confounders were identified by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which was constructed to obtain a systematic representation of a possible causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Adjustments were calculated in two steps, first with the following confounders: maternal age, parity, educational level and country of birth (Adjusted Model 1), and in a second step, BMI was added to the model (Adjusted Model 2). Maternal BMI can both be considered as a confounder and a mediator in the association between PCOS and pregnancy outcomes. In the statistical models, covariates were included as continuous variables, where possible. Pregnancies with missing data on the chosen covariates were excluded from the multivariable analyses. In addition to the additive model (PCOS\u2010only, GDM\u2010only and PCOS + GDM) we also entered an interaction variable PCOS\u2010only * GDM\u2010only. A sensitivity analyses was performed for the outcome SGA where cases with preeclampsia were excluded. Similarly, sensitivity analyses were also performed for all outcomes by excluding all pregnancies through ART to estimate if the ART affected the associations. Due to the large number of statistical comparisons, we corrected for multiple testing by use of Bonferroni correction. Finally, information on BMI was missing in 8.8% of women. As BMI values during pregnancy are not missing at random, we refrained from imputation of missing values.  All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics version 28.0.     3  RESULTS  Table 1 illustrates the maternal characteristics of the study population. Age and BMI tended to increase across all exposed groups. Women with both PCOS and GDM were oldest, had the highest mean BMI and the highest proportion of obesity (BMI \u2265 30\u2009kg/m 2 ). Women with PCOS (with or without GDM) were more often nulliparous, faced more often involuntary childlessness and used ART more frequently. Metformin use before or in the first trimester of pregnancy was most prevalent among women with both PCOS and GDM (8.5%), followed by women with PCOS\u2010only (2.9%), and was lower in the GDM\u2010only and control groups. Most women in the control group were from the Nordic countries (80.4%), whereas fewer were born in the Nordic countries (56.6%) among women with both PCOS and GDM.  Maternal outcomes are presented in Table 2 . Women with PCOS, GDM and the combination of PCOS and GDM had higher odds of both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia compared to unexposed individuals. The risk estimates were attenuated following adjustments and only remained significant for preeclampsia in all diagnostic groups when BMI was added to the models (Model 2). Women with PCOS who developed GDM had an increased risk of preeclampsia in comparison with PCOS\u2010only (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.46\u20132.36 vs. aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.26). Risk estimates and CIs were similar between women with GDM\u2010only (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.45\u20132.15) and the combination of PCOS and GDM (see above), suggesting no increased risk of preeclampsia with the combination in relation to having GDM\u2010only, Table 2 . In line with this, we found no significant PCOS by GDM interaction regarding the maternal outcomes. No increased odds for postpartum hemorrhage or sphincter injury was found in any of the groups.

Women with PCOS\u2010only had a 52% increased risk of stillbirth compared with the control group (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.29\u20131.80), whereas no increased risk was noted among women with GDM (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.24\u20131.39) (Adjusted model 2). Also, increased risk for shoulder dystocia was found in women with PCOS\u2010only and GDM\u2010only compared with the controls.  All groups had an increased risk of giving birth to an LGA infant compared with the control group, especially the groups with GDM diagnoses. The same trend was seen for macrosomia. Among women with PCOS the risk of having an LGA infant increased if they developed GDM. Further, once they had developed GDM, their risk of LGA became ever greater than the risk of women with GDM\u2010only (Table 3 ), although the latter finding did not survive adjustment for BMI.  The odds of having an infant with an Apgar score\u2009<7 at 5\u2009min was increased in women with PCOS\u2010only compared with the controls. Infants of mothers with PCOS, with and without GDM, had higher odds of having birth trauma compared with controls. However, these two findings depended on BMI and did not remain after adjustment.  Increased odds of neonatal hypoglycemia were found in all diagnostic groups compared with the control group, but depended on maternal BMI among women with PCOS\u2010only. The odds of infant respiratory distress were higher in both GDM exposure groups compared with the control group.  Overall, no significant PCOS by GDM interactions were found across the neonatal outcomes, meaning that PCOS did not add to the risk of having GDM\u2010only.  A sensitivity analysis excluding pregnancies by ART treatment gave similar risk estimates in all analyses.    4  DISCUSSION  In this large population\u2010based cohort study, we found that women with PCOS have increased risk of a number of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, but having the combination of PCOS and GDM does not change the risks associated with GDM.  There are limited studies on the coexistence of PCOS and GDM regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes and results are inconsistent. A recent population\u2010based Finnish study which was the first to suggest a higher risk of both spontaneous and overall preterm birth in women with both PCOS and GDM compared to women without PCOS or GDM.  26  On the contrary, in a randomized trial in Norway, no increased risk was found in women with both PCOS and GDM for pregnancy complications other than late miscarriage compared with women with PCOS\u2010only.  27  One explanation of these divergent results could be found in different study designs. This study, and the Finnish study, are both register studies where PCOS and GDM are more likely to be underdiagnosed and underreported. Therefore the exposed group represents the most severe cases with highest probability of adverse outcome. The Norwegian study by Fougher et\u00a0al. is a randomized controlled trial with PCOS diagnosis as an inclusion criteria and probably included a broader spectrum of women with PCOS.  It has been reported previously by our group and others, that women with PCOS have higher risk of stillbirth compared with non\u2010PCOS. 28 , 29 , 30 In this study, we found no increased risk of stillbirth in women with GDM\u2010only, or the combination of PCOS and GDM, in concordance with previous meta\u2010analyses. 31 , 32 This could be explained by closer follow\u2010up of women with GDM diagnosis with earlier induction of labor and tight surveillance during labor.  GDM has a major impact on the risk of giving birth to an LGA infant and macrosomia, confirmed also in this study. Contrary to the systematic meta\u2010analysis in the 2023 guidelines, women with PCOS\u2010only had a small but increased risk of having an LGA infant. Similar results regarding both LGA and macrosomia in women with both PCOS and GDM were found in another Swedish study during same time period.  33  Although we do not know the exact mechanism behind the excessive foetal growth in women with PCOS in our study, we assume that it is partly because of insulin resistance, since maternal weight, GDM and assisted reproduction were accounted for in the analyses. The pathophysiology for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS is not fully understood yet, but is considered to be a combination of oxidative stress and activated immune response. 28 , 34 , 35   Placentas from women with PCOS show alterations associated with an increased hypoxic state.  36  Due to the low prevalence of GDM in the Swedish population, it is also highly plausible that many women with PCOS may have had undiagnosed GDM.  The risk of shoulder dystocia was increased in both PCOS\u2010only and GDM\u2010only compared with controls. The risk was highest among women with GDM, which correlates well with the risk of having an LGA infant and neonatal macrosomia. However, the association was non\u2010significant for women with both conditions, which most likely is the result of low statistical power since only five cases of shoulder dystocia were observed within that group.  In Sweden, all term born infants to mothers with diabetes are screened for neonatal hypoglycemia approximately 3\u2009h after birth, which entails a risk of surveillance bias. In our study, the proportion of infants with neonatal hypoglycemia was higher among mothers diagnosed with GDM\u2010only and the combination of PCOS and GDM. Infants of women with PCOS\u2010only had 28% increased odds in unadjusted analysis of having neonatal hypoglycemia compared with controls, although the finding did not survive correction for multiple testing. Again, this finding could be explained by undiagnosed cases of GDM or not yet diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus in the PCOS group, underpinning the importance of screening with OGTT prior and during pregnancy as recommended in the newly updated PCOS guidelines.  2    Term infants of mothers with GDM\u2010only have almost a two\u2010fold risk for respiratory distress, in adjusted analysis (Model 1), and similar probability when the mother had both PCOS and GDM. Our findings corroborate those of others,  37  and indicate that neonatal respiratory morbidity is not fully explained by physiologic immaturity due to preterm delivery but support the concept that GDM, with and without PCOS, being an independent risk factor for respiratory distress.  38    The main strength of this study is its large population\u2010based sample size, consisting of more than 280\u2009000 births, of which 40\u2009272 births in women with PCOS only, 2236 in women with GDM\u2010only and 1036 in women with both PCOS and GDM. The large sample size yielded the opportunity to explore rare outcomes and to adjust for several confounders. Furthermore, the data originate from well\u2010validated registers and are collected prospectively, limiting the risk of information bias.  Women diagnosed with anovulatory infertility were classified as having PCOS, as the majority of women with that diagnosis have PCOS. Further, to decrease the risk of misclassification, women with a concurrent diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency or hyperprolactinemia and those diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were excluded from the PCOS groups.  There is an inherent risk of undiagnosed women with PCOS within the control group, meaning that the association of PCOS with adverse pregnancy outcomes could be, in reality, even stronger than presented in our results.  The low prevalence of GDM in the study population of 1.2%, concurs with the previously reported 1%\u20133% prevalence in Sweden during the same time period.  24  The low prevalence can be explained by higher cut\u2010off levels for GDM diagnosis than WHO recommended in 2013 along with the fact that screening with OGTT was based on risk factors in almost all regions in Sweden. The prevalence has increased after implementing the updated WHO diagnostic criteria from 2013, where the global prevalence of GDM increased to approximately 14% and the European prevalence to 7.8%.  13    Metformin use in pregnancy was defined as two filled prescriptions to decrease the risk of misclassification of women with one filled prescription who nevertheless stopped taking medication during pregnancy. Metformin use could possibly have affected our results by reducing the risk of preterm birth, but has limited effect on glucose metabolism in pregnant women and has not shown to decrease rates of GDM. 2 , 30 , 39 In our study 8.5% of women with both PCOS and GDM did fill two prescriptions of metformin during the 3\u2009months prior to pregnancy or during first trimester, while it was 2.9% in women with PCOS\u2010only. PCOS is the most likely indication for metformin use in these women as GDM is typically diagnosed later in pregnancy and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Sweden had no national recommendations regarding metformin use in pregnancy during the study period, but according to our data the use increased over the study period.  Women with PCOS are at increased risk of a number of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, but having PCOS also does not change the risks associated with GDM. For some outcomes, like stillbirth, women with PCOS seem to have an increased risk in comparison with controls whereas women with GDM have not. This phenomenon is possibly due to already intensified surveillance of GDM pregnancies, whereas PCOS has not yet been recognized as a risk factor in pregnancy. Thus, it is important to increase awareness about risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS both among the general population and healthcare professionals. According to newly updated guidelines, women with PCOS should be offered OGTT when planning a pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment. If not performed before pregnancy, it could be offered at the first antenatal visit and all women with PCOS should be offered OGTT at gestational week 24\u201328.  2  This screening method would contribute to the early identification of PCOS women with insulin resistance who have not yet developed overt diabetes. Early detection could be beneficial for both the mother and her infant, either through increased and frequent monitoring or through antidiabetic treatment.  The increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcome in women with both PCOS and GDM should be examined further.    5  CONCLUSION  The combination of PCOS and GDM adds no extra risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for neither mother nor infant in comparison to the risks associated with having only GDM. Nevertheless, PCOS is still an unrecognized risk factor in pregnancy, exemplified by the increased risk of stillbirth. With increased awareness of PCOS, precise diagnosis of PCOS prior to pregnancy as well as early screening and diagnosis of diabetes and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, neonatal outcomes could be improved.
