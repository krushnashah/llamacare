The management of PCOS is challenging and current interventions are not enough to deal with all consequences of this syndrome. We explored the beneficial effect of combined sodium glucose co transporter\u20102 inhibitor (SGLT\u20102i); (empagliflozin) and metformin on hormonal and metabolic parameters in an animal model of PCOS and insulin resistance (IR). Forty adult female Wistar rats divided into five groups: control, PCOS\u2010IR, PCOS\u2010IR treated with metformin, PCOS\u2010IR treated with empagliflozin, and PCOS\u2010IR treated with combined metformin and empagliflozin. Single modality treatment with metformin or empagliflozin yielded significant improvement in body mass index, insulin resistance, lipid profile, sex hormones, inflammatory markers, and ovarian cystic follicles. Combined metformin with empagliflozin expressed further significant improvement in sex hormones, inflammatory markers with disappearance of ovarian cystic follicles. The superior significant improvement with combined treatment over the single modality was in line with significant improvement in the ovarian AMPK\u03b1\u2010SIRT1 expression. Sodium glucose co transporter\u20102 inhibitors (SGLT\u20102i); empagliflozin combined to metformin could enhance hormonal parameters, insulin resistance, and inflammatory biomarkers in rat model of PCOS\u2010IR with modulating ovarian AMPK\u2010SIRT1 pathway which may be the molecular basis for IR in PCOS and may potentially be a therapeutic target.",
    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered a common endocrine disorder in females during their reproductive age with a prevalence of 5%\u201310% (Tao et\u00a0al., 2019 ). This syndrome is of unknown etiology, characterized by disturbed ovulatory function, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. There is high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (IR) in women with PCOS (Salley et\u00a0al., 2007 ). The etiology of PCOS has been the subject of several theories. For instance, the hypothalamus might produce excessive amounts of gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH). The excessive luteinizing hormone (LH) that results from the GnRH surge in turn overstimulates the ovaries to make more testosterone (Rashid et\u00a0al., 2022 ). A different PCOS syndrome explanation theory is based on endocrinological disruptions of the insulin axis, such as hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Increased levels of circulating insulin reduce the liver's production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Hyperandrogenemia is brought on by the decrease in SHBG, which raises the amount of free circulating testosterone in the blood (Wallace et\u00a0al., 2013 ). The frequency of GnRH pulses is likewise increased by hyperinsulinemia, although the LH surge predominates over the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) surge. This causes a reduction in SHBG, an increase in ovarian androgen production, and a decrease in follicular maturation; the PCOS\u2010IR progresses, and eventually can lead to long\u2010term complications such as diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, ischemic heart disease, and uterine cancer (Li et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Accordingly, management of PCOS should not aim only to improve the symptoms, it should address both the reproductive and metabolic diseases associated with PCOS (Legro et\u00a0al., 2013 ; Teede et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Use of contraceptives and anti\u2010androgens have been the cornerstone for addressing the menstrual disturbances and hyperandrogenism (Yildiz, 2015 ); however, some of these treatments may fail to affect the lipid profile in PCOS and hence increase the risk of developing cardiovascular complications (Amiri et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Weight control and lifestyle modification is one of the important components in the treatment of the disease, however, many patients fail to lose weight or quickly regain fat (Moran et\u00a0al., 2011 ). So, effective intervention is needed to minimize these metabolic complications in women with PCOS.  Metformin and thiazolidinedione are two glucose\u2010lowering medications that have been used to treat PCOS' metabolic abnormalities (such as insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus) and chronic anovulation; however, their use has not consistently resulted in improvements in the management of body weight and composition, menstrual irregularities, or clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism (Morley et\u00a0al., 2017 ; Sam & Ehrmann, 2017 ).  Metformin (MF), insulin sensitizer, has been shown a treatment option that targets multiple components of PCOS (Diamanti\u2010Kandarakis et\u00a0al., 2010 ). In 1994 , Velazquez, reported the beneficial effects that MF had on reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions in females with PCOS. After that, many studies have confirmed the therapeutic effect of MF on IR and metabolic abnormalities in females with PCOS. MF enhances insulin sensitivity through decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis mediated via activation of AMP\u2010activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, hence, lowers blood glucose (Kim et\u00a0al., 2008 ). The side effects of MF are the main drawback that limit its use broadly in PCOS patients. These side effects include mainly the gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, diarrhea, and distention. In addition, the weight reducing impact of MF does not seem to be very satisfactory (Harborne et\u00a0al., 2005 ).  Sodium glucose co transporter\u20102 inhibitors (SGLT\u20102i) (e.g., empagliflozin and dapagliflozin) are antidiabetic drugs that act through reducing glucose reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the kidney via inhibition of SGLT\u20102 and so increases its excretion (Chao, 2014 ). This class of antidiabetics has a minimal risk of hypoglycemia as it is glucose\u2010dependent and insulin\u2010independent in contrast to other antidiabetics (Scheen & Paquot, 2014 ). They enhance insulin sensitivity via reducing glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, enhancement of \u03b2\u2010cells functions, and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (Pereira & Eriksson, 2019 ). Adding to their cardiovascular and renal protective effects, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown promising effect in controlling of the body weight (Yaribeygi et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  Recently, in trials involving patients with PCOS, treatment with empagliflozin as opposed to metformin has demonstrated promising effects, with notable improvements in anthropometric measures and body composition. (Javed et\u00a0al., 2019 ). This proposes the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of women with PCOS. Common side effects reported for the SGLT2 inhibitors are, genitourinary tract infection and vulvovaginitis (Zinman et\u00a0al., 2015 ). However, the exact efficacy and potential mechanism for the use of empagliflozin in PCOS has remained to be elucidated. It has been reported that the AMPK\u2010SIRT1 molecular pathway has a role in the pathogenesis of IR in PCOS (Tao et\u00a0al., 2017 ). They demonstrated that that this molecular pathway may be a significant molecular contributor to IR in PCOS patients and may act as a therapeutic target for the creation of novel therapies to enhance the metabolic and reproductive health of PCOS patients.  Based on this, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether adding SGLT\u20102i; empagliflozin to metformin could improve hormonal parameters, insulin resistance, and inflammatory biomarkers than metformin alone in rat model of PCOS\u2010IR. We aimed also to investigate whether their potential therapeutic effects were related to the AMPK\u03b1\u2010SIRT1 pathway. In this study, we use letrozole combined with a high fat diet for 27\u2009days to induce a PCOS\u2010IR rat model which had the characteristics of ovarian polycystic changes and endocrine and metabolic disorders (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020 ).    2  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND TREATMENT  Forty mature female Wistar rats (weighing 160\u2013200\u2009g) were used in this investigation. They were acquired from Cairo University's Faculty of Medicine's Animal House. The rats were kept in wire mesh cages at room temperature with regular light and dark cycles in the animal house of Cairo University's college of medicine. This study was approved by Institutional animal care and use Committee, Cairo university. Before the study began, the animals were subjected for daily morning vaginal smear to assess the regularity of their estrous cycle. Then, the experimental rats were randomly split into five groups (eight in each).   Group 1, (control) : For the first 27\u2009days, the rats in the control group were given on daily basis 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)\u2010Na (1\u2009mL/100\u2009g/day) solution by intragastric administration along with standard diet (protein 20%, carbohydrate 70%, and fat 10%) and free water, and for the following 28\u2009days, they were given only distilled water through orogastric gavage.   Group 2, (PCOS\u2010IR) : For 27\u2009days, the rats in this group consumed a high fat diet (protein 20%, carbohydrate 20%, and fat 60%) along with full access to water and daily intragastric infusion of letrozole (Femara; Novartis), 1\u2009mg/kg dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)\u2010Na (1\u2009mL/100\u2009g/day) (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020 ), and for the following 28\u2009days, they were given only distilled water through orogastric gavage.   Group 3, (PCOS\u2010IR+ metformin) : Following the induction of PCOS\u2010IR as in group 2 (PCOS\u2010IR) rats, metformin (Glucophage 500\u2009mg; Merck Pharmaceuticals) was given via orogastric gavage at a dose of 300\u2009mg per kilogram per day for the following 28\u2009days. The amount of metformin utilized in this trial was comparable to the dosage given to PCOS patients (Reagan\u2010Shaw et\u00a0al., 2008 ; Sander et\u00a0al., 2006 ).   Group 4, (PCOS\u2010IR+ empagliflozin) : Following the induction of PCOS\u2010IR as in group 2 (PCOS\u2010IR) rats, empagliflozin (EMPA, 10\u2009mg/kg/day) was administered via orogastric gavage (Woods et\u00a0al., 2019 ) for the following 28\u2009days.   Group 5, (PCOS\u2010IR+ combined metformin\u2009+\u2009empagliflozin) : Following the induction of PCOS\u2010IR as in group 2 (PCOS\u2010IR) rats, then were administered metformin (Glucophage 500\u2009mg; Merck Pharmaceuticals) at 300\u2009mg / kg /day and empagliflozin (EMPA, 10\u2009mg/kg/day) via orogastric gavage for the next 28\u2009days.   2.1  Experimental measurements   The body weights and nose\u2010anus lengths were measured weekly, and BMI were calculated according to the formula (Novelli et\u00a0al., 2007 ):   Body mass index (BMI)\u2009=\u2009body weight (g)/square length (cm 2 ) Vaginal epithelial cell smears were performed in all experimental rats after 4\u2009weeks and 8\u2009weeks from the start of the experiment to assess the stages of the rats' estrous cycle (Salama et\u00a0al., 2020 ). Blood samples were taken through the retro\u2010orbital plexus at the conclusion of the 8\u2010week research period and centrifuged for 20\u2009min at 12298 g. The serum was then isolated and kept at \u221270\u00b0C for use in estimating the parameters listed below:  Fasting serum glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA\u2010IR): Using tools provided by \u201cDiamond Diagnostics,\u201d (Holliston, MA), the serum glucose level was tested as previously described (Trinder, 1969 ). Rat insulin ELISA kits were used to perform an enzyme immunoassay to measure the serum insulin concentrations. (Gallois et\u00a0al., 1996 ), and HOMA\u2010IR index was then calculated with the following equation: (Emoto et\u00a0al., 1999 ).  Fasting plasma insulin  FPI  mIU \u00d7 fasting plasma glucose  FPG  mmol / L 22.5   Lipid profile (Total cholesterol, Triglycerides, and HDL): Total serum cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride were measured using the conventional quantitative enzymatic colorimetric method (Allain et\u00a0al., 1974 ), (Buckley et\u00a0al., 1966 ). Hormonal assay: Serum hormone levels were assessed as previously mentioned (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Using ELISA Kits, the levels of serum FSH, LH, testosterone, and estradiol were determined (Enzo Life Science, Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA).The procedure was followed as given in the kit catalog (Stat Fax\u00ae 2100, Fisher Bioblock Scientific, France). Serum pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines: Measurement of serum tumor necrosis factor \u03b1; TNF \u03b1 was measured via quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (Kinra & Dutta, 2013 ). The serum interleukin\u20106; IL6 was measured by using the ELISA (Quantikine; R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions (Hirano, 1998 ).    2.1.1  Tissue samples  Rats were sacrificed by decapitation at the conclusion of the 8\u2010week research period, and their ovaries were dissected and cleansed of fat. The left ovaries were immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax then processed as paraffin blocks. The right ovaries were rinsed in ice\u2010cold saline, divided into small pieces, and stored at 80\u00b0C until employed for biochemical determination of relative gene expression and protein levels of AMPK and SIRT1 by real\u2010time PCR and western blot following the protocols below: Total RNA extraction: RNeasy system was used to further purify the total RNA after it had been obtained using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A UV spectrophotometer was used to measure the quantities and purity of RNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis: Using the Super Script III First\u2010Strand Synthesis System and the manufacturer's instructions, 1\u2009g of RNA was converted into cDNA (#K1621, Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA). Real\u2010time quantitative PCR Real\u2010time: Using an Applied Biosystem with software version 3.1, PCR amplification and analysis were carried out (Step One\u2122, USA). Using RNA sequences from the gene bank, Gene Runner Software (Hasting Software, Inc., Hasting, NY) was used to make gene\u2010specific primer pairs. The SYBR Green Master Mix was used in the reaction (Applied Biosystems). Each primer set's annealing temperature was calculated to be 60 degrees. In a 25 \u03bcL reaction volume, quantitative RT\u2010PCR was carried out using 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 900\u2009nM of each primer, and 2\u2009\u03bcL of cDNA.    Amplification conditions were : 2\u2009min at 50\u00b0, 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0, and 40\u2009cycles of 15\u2010second denaturation followed by 10\u2009min of annealing/extension at 60\u00b0. Using PE Biosystems' v1\u20107 sequence detection software, real\u2010time assay data were calculated (Foster City, CA). The comparative Ct technique was used to determine the relative expression of the investigated gene's mRNA. Beta actin was used as the control housekeeping gene and all values were normalized against it and reported as fold change over background levels detected in the diseased groups.

The ovarian slides stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) were blindly examined by two MD\u2010investigators using light microscopy connected to digital camera (Olympus, Japan) to assess the ovarian follicles. Five non\u2010overlapping fields/ H&E section/ rat, at magnification \u00d7100, were evaluated for counting the sum of Graafian follicles, displaying a large fluid\u2010filled antral cavity surrounded by granulosa cells and containing oocyte, and the corpora leutea.     2.2  Western blot for AMPK and SIRT1 levels  For Western blot analysis, tissues were homogenized in the homogenization buffer containing 50\u2009mM Tris pH\u20097.4, 10\u2009mM NaF, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 10\u2009mM \u03b2\u2010glycerol phosphate, 1\u2009mM Na3VO4, 0.2% W/V sodium deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340) employing polytron homogenizer (POLYTRON_ PT 10\u201335, Kinematica, Switzerland) in ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. The Bradford protein assay kit (Bio\u2010Rad) was used to measure the protein concentration in the supernatants. AMPK, SIRT1, and actin levels were assessed by immunological blotting analysis. Then, the separated samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. To summarize, the produced samples were combined with loading buffer and heated for 8\u2009min at 95\u00b0C. The blots were incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature in blocking buffer TBS\u2010T (5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween\u201020 in Tris\u2010buffered saline). The primary antibodies for AMPK, Sirt1, and beta actin were provided by Thermo Fisher and utilized at a dilution of 1:000. After being exposed to the primary antibodies for an overnight period at 4\u00b0C, the blots were washed three times for 10\u2009min each in TSB containing 0.1% Tween\u201020. The membranes were then cleaned as previously mentioned and treated with the matching secondary antibody. Alliance gel doc (Alliance 4.7 Gel doc, UK) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate) were used to see protein bands. Protein bands were semi\u2010quantified using UV Tec software (UK). The beta actin protein was used to normalize all protein bands.    2.3  Statistical methods  The data were coded and entered using SPSS version 28 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) using one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post\u2010hoc multiple comparison test.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Confirmation of PCOS   The cytology of the vaginal swab was examined to confirm the induction of PCOS. Epithelial cells with a small number of keratinocytes are present during the proestrus stage; keratinocytes are present during the estrus; keratinocytes, leukocytes, and epithelial cells are present during the metestrus; and predominantly leucocytes are present during the diestrus. In a PCOS\u2010IR model, BMI is considerably improved by metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination.  As shown in Table 1 , significant increase in BMI was observed in PCOS\u2010IR rats as compared with control group (0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 vs. 0.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06; p <\u20090.05). Metformin treatment resulted in significant improvement in the elevated BMI (0.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 vs. 0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p <\u20090.05). Empagliflozin treatment also showed a similar effect on PCOS\u2010IR rats to that of metformin on BMI (0.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 vs. 0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p <\u20090.05). Combined metformin with empagliflozin expressed significant decrease in the elevated BMI values (0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 vs. 0.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06; p <\u20090.05), however, it did not show significant superior effect to single modality treatment.

As\u00a0shown in Table 1 , in PCOS\u2010IR rats, the fasting insulin was higher than that in the control rats (20.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.75 vs. 9.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85; p <\u20090.05), Fasting glucose levels also manifested significant increase in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (16.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.81 vs. 5.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64; p <\u20090.05). HOMA\u2010IR increased significantly in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (15.14\u2009\u00b1\u20092.39 vs. 2.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36; p <\u20090.05), suggesting insulin resistance in PCOS\u2010IR rats' model. Metformin treatment resulted in significant decrease in the elevated insulin, glucose levels, and the HOMA\u2010IR in PCOS\u2010IR rats (fasting insulin, 11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69; glucose, 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92; HOMA\u2010IR, 34.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63; p <\u20090.05). Empagliflozin treatment showed a similar effect on PCOS\u2010IR rats to that of metformin (fasting insulin, 13.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26; glucose, 8.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67; HOMA\u2010IR, 4.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.71; p <\u20090.05). Furthermore, combined metformin with empagliflozin significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the respective empagliflozin alone on the insulin, glucose levels, and HOMA\u2010IR in PCOS\u2010IR rats (fasting insulin, 10.33\u2009\u00b1\u20091.16; glucose, 5.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.88; HOMA\u2010IR, 2.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.51; p <\u20090.05). However, combined metformin with empagliflozin did not significantly enhance the inhibitory effect of the respective metformin alone on the insulin levels and HOMA\u2010IR in PCOS\u2010IR rats with only significant decrease in the glucose levels (5.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.88; p <\u20090.05). The results showed that metformin and empagliflozin combination therapy reduced the high levels of insulin and ameliorated insulin resistance in PCOS\u2010IR as compared with empagliflozin alone.    3.3  Metformin, empagliflozin and their combination ameliorate serum lipid profile in a PCOS\u2010IR model  Disturbed lipid profile is an important aspect in PCOS\u2010IR patients. As shown in Table 1 , in PCOS\u2010IR rats, total cholesterol was significantly higher than that in the control rats (256.13\u2009\u00b1\u200914.12 vs. 143.63\u2009\u00b1\u20097.21; p <\u20090.05), triglycerides level also showed significant increase in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (134.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.86 vs. 81.88\u2009\u00b1\u20099.69; p <\u20090.05). Serum HDL decreased significantly in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (31.37\u2009\u00b1\u20096.55 vs. 58.25\u2009\u00b1\u20095.99; p <\u20090.05).Use of metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination showed significant improvement in total cholesterol level (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 178.63\u2009\u00b1\u20099.33; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 186.38\u2009\u00b1\u200913.57; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 187.13\u2009\u00b1\u20098.71 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 256.13\u2009\u00b1\u200914.12 p <\u20090.05), Triglycerides level (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 94.38\u2009\u00b1\u20098.63; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 94.88\u2009\u00b1\u20099.63; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 79\u2009\u00b1\u20098.38 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 134.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.86 p <\u20090.05), and HDL level (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 48.75\u2009\u00b1\u20096.27; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 48.88\u2009\u00b1\u20096.27; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 52.38\u2009\u00b1\u20095.07 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 31.37\u2009\u00b1\u20096.55 p <\u20090.05). Combined metformin with empagliflozin significantly enhanced the effect of the respective empagliflozin alone on triglycerides, otherwise, no significant difference observed for combined metformin with empagliflozin over single modality treatment on lipid profile.    3.4  Metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination ameliorate sex hormone disturbances in a PCOS\u2010IR model  Hyperandrogenism is the corner stone in PCOS and insulin resistant patients. As shown in Table 1 , in PCOS\u2010IR rats, the testosterone level was higher than that in the control rats (8.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.59 vs. 1.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35; p <\u20090.05), estradiol levels also showed significant decrease in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (63.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.82 vs. 128.73\u2009\u00b1\u20099.35; p <\u20090.05). LH level decreased significantly in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (53.54\u2009\u00b1\u20097.81 vs. 13.48\u2009\u00b1\u20092.27; p <\u20090.05), while FSH showed significant increase in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared with control rats (5.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83 vs. 1.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.37; p <\u20090.05) indicating characteristic hormonal disturbances in PCOS\u2010IR rats model. Metformin or empagliflozin treatment of PCOS\u2010IR rats significantly decreased the level of testosterone (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 4.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 4.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58; vs. PCOS\u2010IR, 8.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.59 p <\u20090.05). Furthermore, use of metformin or empagliflozin showed significant improvement in estradiol level (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 110.56\u2009\u00b1\u20093.05; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 109.96\u2009\u00b1\u20093.62; vs. PCOS\u2010IR 63.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.82 p <\u20090.05), LH levels (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 22.14\u2009\u00b1\u20092.23; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 22.56\u2009\u00b1\u20092.33; vs. PCOS\u2010IR 53.54\u2009\u00b1\u20097.81 p <\u20090.05), and FSH levels (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31; vs. PCOS\u2010IR 5.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83 p <\u20090.05). The improvement of sex hormones was intensified with combined treatment of metformin and empagliflozin compared to that with single treatment (testosterone, 1.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22; estradiol, 122.85\u2009\u00b1\u20093.68; LH, 16.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1; FSH, 1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38 p <\u20090.05).    3.5  Polycystic ovary and insulin resistance significantly increased the levels of inflammatory markers; TNF \u2010\u03b1 and IL6 , which was reversed by intake of metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination  Inflammation is one of the most potent risk factors of PCOS. As shown in Table 1 , there was a significant increase in the mean values of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL6 in PCOS\u2010IR rats than that in the control rats (133.84\u2009\u00b1\u200931.5 and 127.21\u2009\u00b1\u20095.63 vs. 32.03\u2009\u00b1\u20093.63 and 31.23\u2009\u00b1\u20093.52; p <\u20090.05 respectively). Use of metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination showed significant improvement in TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 76.21\u2009\u00b1\u20098.47; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 76.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.17; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 50.41\u2009\u00b1\u20097.07 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 133.84\u2009\u00b1\u200931.5 p <\u20090.05), and IL6 levels (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 70.36\u2009\u00b1\u20095.86; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 68.78\u2009\u00b1\u20098.44; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 46.64\u2009\u00b1\u20094.85 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 127.21\u2009\u00b1\u20095.63 p <\u20090.05). Interestingly, significant improvement of the inflammatory markers was noticed with combined treatment of metformin and empagliflozin compared to single modality treatment.    3.6  Metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination improve ovarian cystic follicles and metabolic disturbances in PCOS\u2010IR model through the AMPK\u03b1\u2010SIRT1 pathway  As shown in Figure 1 , there was a significant decrease in the relative expression of AMPK\u03b1 in ovarian tissue in PCOS\u2010IR rats than that in the control rats (0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 vs. 1.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01; p <\u20090.05). Use of metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination showed significant improvement in the relative expression of AMPK\u03b1 in ovarian tissue (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 0.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u00b1\u200931.5 p <\u20090.05). Also, there was a significant decrease in the relative expression of SIRT1 in ovarian tissue in PCOS\u2010IR rats than that in the control rats (0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009\u00b1\u20095.63 vs. 11.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01; p <\u20090.05) (Figure 2 ).We reported significant improvement in the relative expression of SIRT1 levels with use of metformin, empagliflozin, and their combination (PCOS\u2010IR Met, 0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; PCOS\u2010IR Empa, 0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; PCOS\u2010IR Met+Empa, 0.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 vs. PCOS\u2010IR 0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u00b1\u200931.5 p <\u20090.05). We noticed that use of combined treatment of metformin and empagliflozin significantly improved the relative expression of AMPK\u03b1 and SIRT1 in PCOS\u2010IR rats compared to single modality treatment. In Figure 3 , we also noticed with western blot analysis of in ovarian homogenate that protein levels of AMPK\u03b1 and SIRT1 were improved significantly with combined metformin and empagliflozin treatment.

Besides, the control rats showed regular estrous cycle after 4 and 8\u2009weeks of the start of the experiment; proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrous (Figures 4a\u2013d ). All rats of PCOS rats illustrated prolonged diestrus phase after 4 and 8\u2009weeks (Figures 4e ). On single modality treatment, five rats with each treatment experienced epithelial keratinocytes observed microscopically during the vaginal smears at the end of the experiment. However, seven rats with the combined treatment displaced regular phases of the estrous cycle in the vaginal smears at the end of the experiment that was comparable to the control rats (data not shown).

Normal ovarian follicles at various stages of maturity were visible in control ovarian rat models. There were many cystic follicles with thin granulosa cell layer and compressed ovarian stroma in PCOS\u2010IR rats with a significant decrease in the number of mature Graafian follicles and corpora leutea. The size and number of the ovarian cystic follicles were reduced with the use of metformin or empagliflozin, and the thickness of the granulosa cell layer was increased. Meanwhile, using metformin and empagliflozin as a combined treatment led to restoration of the follicular growth and maturation into different stages with significant increase in the number of the mature ovarian follicles and corpora leutea as compared to other experimental groups.

Despite this, there are currently a dearth of efficient, evidence\u2010based treatments for such hormonal and metabolic disorders. In the present study, letrozole combined with a high fat diet for 27\u2009days exhibited features of PCOS\u2010IR including ovarian cystic changes, sex hormone disturbances, insulin resistance together with weight gain, dyslipidemia, and elevated inflammatory markers.  One of the main traits of PCOS is IR, with compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Both IR and hyperinsulinemia are linked to metabolic syndrome and can lead to abnormalities in reproduction. There is proof that insulin sensitizers like metformin can enhance PCOS patients' reproductive health. (Fulghesu et\u00a0al., 2012 ; Pasquali, 2015 ).  Dyslipidemia is one of the rather common metabolic issues in women with PCOS. Since insulin resistance is a primary pathophysiology of PCOS, dyslipidemia in PCOS\u2010afflicted women may be consistent with cases of the condition that have been documented in an insulin resistant state. In the present study, we demonstrated that empagliflozin, metformin monotreatment, and combined drug treatment of PCOS\u2010IR rat model for 28\u2009days exhibited significant improvement in HOMA\u2010IR and dyslipidemia where combined metformin and empagliflozin has shown significant superior effect to empagliflozin but not to metformin monotreatment.  Accumulating evidence have examined how insulin resistance in PCOS women could be managed by metformin, empagliflozin, either alone or in combination with other treatments. (Abuelghar et\u00a0al., 2013 ; El Maghraby et\u00a0al., 2015 ; El\u2010khayat et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Mhao et\u00a0al., 2016 ).In accordance with our findings, study done on efficacy of canagliflozin versus metformin in women with PCOS revealed that both drugs can significantly improve HOMA\u2010IR in women having PCOS with IR without significant difference between them (Cai et\u00a0al., 2022 ). Several lines of evidence point to beneficial effect of metformin in improving HOMA\u2010IR in PCOS women (Li et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Tan et\u00a0al., 2008 ). Proposed mechanisms of action of metformin are through minimizing hepatic glucose output and improving the insulin\u2010mediated uptake of glucose (Abdalla et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  SGLT2 inhibitors also known to enhance insulin sensitivity via multiple pathways as facilitating \u03b2\u2010cells function, caloric deposition and reducing glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative damage, and inflammatory processes (Yaribeygi et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  Numerous studies have demonstrated that metformin has a considerable impact on dyslipidemia (Fleming et\u00a0al., 2002 ; Ng et\u00a0al., 2001 ), either directly by affecting how the liver processes free fatty acids or indirectly by lowering hyperinsulinemia (Sin et\u00a0al., 2011 ).  SGLT\u20102 inhibitors also affect plasma lipids as studies have been shown that use of SGLT\u20102 inhibitors results in a reduction in triglycerides, increases in HDL and LDL\u2010cholesterol levels (Briand et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Inzucchi et\u00a0al., 2015 ). It has been hypothesized that hemoconcentration happened upon use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a result of increased urinary volume could be the contributing factor to the reported high LDL\u2010C levels (Lund et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Pieber et\u00a0al., 2015 ).  In contrast to our results, Javed et\u00a0al., 2019 performed RCT, comparing hormonal and metabolic effect of empagliflozin versus metformin in PCOS women; where they did not report significant changes in fasting glucose, insulin, or lipids after 3\u2009months of treatment. They explained their findings by pointing to the brief study duration or the youthful age and lack of diabetes of their PCOS participants.  Insulin resistance (IR) is tissue\u2010selective in PCOS patients, as evidenced by the fact that the ovaries and adrenal glands continue to respond to insulin despite skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, and the liver losing their sensitivity to it (Dabadghao, 2019 ). By stimulating insulin's receptors in the follicle membrane cells, which in turn triggers androgen synthesis in ovarian theca cells, insulin successfully promotes ovarian follicle development and hormone release. Additionally, through its receptors in the pituitary gland, hyperinsulinemia causes the release of LH (Rothenberg et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  Study on PCOS women has shown that high testosterone levels are capable of being converted to estrone in adipose tissue. Increased conversion of estrone to estradiol, which alters follicle development and increases the LH to FSH ratio, causes ovulatory dysfunction. (Li et\u00a0al., 2019 ).  Hyperandrogenism (HA) raised the LH levels as a result of disturbed the negative feedback effect of estradiol and progesterone on GnRH (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et\u00a0al., 2017 ). Additionally, HA worsens IR through a variety of mechanisms, including decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased GLUT\u20104 expression, and decreased insulin breakdown in the liver. A kind of skeletal muscle fiber with low insulin sensitivity is also increased by HA (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019 ). On the other hand, HA exacerbates central obesity, a factor in IR (Li et\u00a0al., 2019 ). In the present study, we demonstrated that metformin or empagliflozin treatment of PCOS\u2010IR rats significantly decreased the level of testosterone and induced significant improvement in estradiol, LH, and FSH levels. The improvement of sex hormones was intensified with combined treatment of metformin and empagliflozin compared to that with single modality.  We also demonstrated reduction in the size of cystic follicles with increased thickness of granulosa cell layer in PCOS\u2010IR rats that received metformin or empagliflozin. Use of combined treatment of metformin and empagliflozin showed apparently normal growing follicles at different stages of maturation with disappearance of cystic follicles.  In accordance with our results, study done by Wu et\u00a0al., 2018 investigating the combined effect of metformin and pioglitazone on the testosterone levels and follicular development in a rat model of PCOS found that metformin treatment significantly inhibited the level of free and total testosterone (TT). They also verified that metformin treatment improved follicular development in a rat model of PCOS, with reduced proportions of primary and cystic follicles and larger proportions of early antral follicles. Study done by Rafiee et\u00a0al., 2022 revealed that metformin treatment of PCOS\u2010affected ovaries in mice, increased the number of corpus luteum, primordial and graafian follicles; while decreased the number of primary, secondary, atretic follicles, and ovarian cysts.  Many studies showed that analysis of follicular count in PCOS models showed significant increase in the numbers of preantral follicles, the numbers of atretic follicles, and ratios of atretic follicle to the total numbers of follicles, while the numbers of primordial follicle pool, antral follicles, and corpora leutea were significantly decreased as compared to the control groups (Wu et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Furat et\u00a0al., 2018 ). Accordingly, the sum of Graafian follicles, displaying a large fluid\u2010filled antral cavity surrounded by granulosa cells and containing oocyte, and the corpora leutea were estimated in our work.  Another randomized controlled trial discovered that a brief, 2\u2010day regimen of metformin; effectively reduced the testosterone levels caused by LH in PCOS women. They proposed that metformin has an immediate impact on androgen secretion and/or production at the ovarian level, separate from its effects on insulin sensitivity (Kurzthaler et\u00a0al., 2014 ).  Previous studies have shown the beneficial impact of metformin on hormonal disturbances in PCOS; A study by Hu et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2020 ) on the impact of metformin on PCOS in rats revealed that metformin\u2010treated animals had significantly improved levels of LH, testosterone, FSH, and LH/FSH ratio compared to model rats. They also showed that the number of granulosa cells and the production of lutein were significantly improved in the metformin\u2010treated group, while cystic follicle enlargement was missing. Our findings are consistent with those of Zaheer et\u00a0al., 2021 , who examined the impact of canagliflozin and metformin on the estrous cycle and hormonal dysregulation of letrozole\u2010induced PCOS in rats and came to the conclusion that canagliflozin is effective alone and enhances the impact of metformin in the regulation of estrous cycles and reversal of hormonal disturbances in a rat model of PCOS. According to reports, canagliflozin enhances B\u2010cell activity by lowering insulin demand and hyperinsulinemia, which are major contributors to the rise in testosterone levels in PCOS. On the other hand, a meta\u2010analysis was carried out by Sinha and Ghosal\u00a0( 2022 ) to highlight the effect of SGLT\u20102 inhibitors on the metabolic and hormonal aspects of PCOS. They discovered that, aside from the effect on dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), there was no significant difference seen for the free androgen index (FAI), TT, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).  The reduction in DHEAS demonstrated here raises an intriguing hypothesis whereby SGLT\u20102 inhibitors, by virtue of their special capacity to lower body weight and enhance glucose uptake, would decrease hyperinsulinemia, along with a reduction in DHEAS leading to a reduction in free testosterone, which in turn would improve glucose utilization, forming a basis for breaking the vicious cycle of hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism, which is the foundation of PCOS.  Uncertainty exists regarding the process through which IR advancements improve PCOS's endocrine and reproductive systems. In present study, we demonstrated that letrozole combined with a high fat diet for 27\u2009days exhibited features of PCOS\u2010IR with significant decrease in the relative expression of AMPK\u03b1 and SIRT\u20101 in ovarian tissue. Besides, the expression levels of AMPK\u03b1 and SIRT\u20101 in ovarian tissue were upregulated in the PCOS\u2010IR rat model which received empagliflozin, metformin monotreatment and combined drug treatment of for 28\u2009days.  Many studies have found that AMPK agonists, such as metformin, can improve PCOS endocrine and reproductive function (Fulghesu et\u00a0al., 2012 ; Kiyak Caglayan et\u00a0al., 2015 ), which coincides our experimental findings. Study done by Tao et\u00a0al., 2019 demonstrated that 4\u2009weeks treatment of PCOS group with metformin has shown a substantial improvement in body weight, fasting blood sugar, and HOMA\u2010IR with an increase in AMPK and SIRT1 expression compared to the PCOS group that had not received treatment. Another in\u00a0vitro study in women with PCOS found that metformin could improve granulocyte function by reducing TNF\u2010 and chemokine\u2010mediated inflammatory responses (Kai et\u00a0al., 2015 ). Also, it has been found that SIRT1 levels will be decreased in patients with PCOS (Kiyak Caglayan et\u00a0al., 2015 ).  It has been established that SIRT1 and AMPK are closely related since activating AMPK significantly increases SIRT1 activity (Oliva et\u00a0al., 2008 ). Coincidentally, a prior study discovered that the AMPK agonist metformin significantly raised SIRT1 levels and enhanced reproductive endocrine function in PCOS rats (Tao et\u00a0al., 2015 ).  According to a study done by Lee et\u00a0al.\u00a0( 2021 ), ipragliflozin treatment over long period of time has shown favorable metabolic effects on mice with HFD induced obesity. They reported that SGLT2 inhibitor boosted AMPK phosphorylation, increasing SIRT1 in the liver and WAT as a result. Canagliflozin has also been observed to increase adipocyte cellular energy expenditure by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis through the AMPK\u2010Sirt1\u2010Pgc\u20101 signaling pathway (Yang et\u00a0al., 2020 ).  Other in\u00a0vitro study on HG\u2010treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed that HG results in inactivation of AMPK/SIRT1/PGC\u20101\u03b1 axis, whereas Dapagliflozin treatment restored SIRT1, PGC\u20101\u03b1, and p\u2010AMPK (Faridvand et\u00a0al., 2022 ).  PCOS is considered a pro\u2010inflammatory state where T2DM and cardiovascular illnesses are linked to this inflammatory condition (Vgontzas et\u00a0al., 2003 ). According to previous reports, PCOS patients have higher expression of cytokines that promote inflammation (Gonz\u00e1lez, 2012 ; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014 ). Inflammation explains the link between the metabolic aspects of PCOS like insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (Osborn & Olefsky, 2012 ).  Studies suggested that an imbalance of anti\u2010inflammatory and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines may result in disturbed ovarian function, altered steroidogenesis, and diminished follicular maturation (Vural et\u00a0al., 2010 ).  In the present study, use of metformin or empagliflozin showed significant improvement in inflammatory markers; TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL6 and use of combined treatments demonstrated superior significant anti\u2010inflammatory effect in PCOS\u2010IR rat model as compared to single modality. Numerous studies using human and animal cells, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells or bovine aortic endothelial cells, have demonstrated that metformin reduces the inflammatory state caused by hyperglycemia by suppressing the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010B) signaling pathway through AMPK\u2010dependent and independent pathways. Suppression of NF\u2010\u03baB decreases the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators like interleukin 6, interleukin 1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF\u03b1). Metformin can also indirectly inhibit chronic inflammation through enhancing insulin sensitivity, regulating hyperglycemia, preventing formation of advanced glycation end\u2010products (AGEs), and diabetic atherogenic dyslipidemia (Kury\u0142owicz & Ko\u017aniewski, 2020 ; Nasri & Rafieian\u2010Kopaei, 2014 ; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2018 ).  In agreement with our results, study done by Bonora et\u00a0al., 2020 reported that SGLT\u20102 inhibitors significantly improved serum levels of inflammatory markers like IL\u20101\u03b2, IL6, and TNF\u03b1.  According to previous studies, SGLT\u20102 inhibitors help to minimize oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions (Han et\u00a0al., 2017 ; Leng et\u00a0al., 2016 ). It has been demonstrated also that use of SGLT\u20102 inhibitors can drastically reduce both the infiltration of macrophages and the expression of inflammatory M1 markers including TNF\u2010, IL\u20101, and IL6 (McKellar et\u00a0al., 2009 ; Moriya, 2019 ). The underlying molecular pathway of the anti\u2010inflammatory effects of SGLT\u20102 inhibitors are still not fully understood. However, they might behave somewhat similarly to metformin. In\u00a0vitro, it has been discovered that SGLT\u20102 inhibitors activates AMPK (directly or by boosting adiponectin expression (Xu et\u00a0al., 2017 ).  Obesity is one of the most common disorder that complicates the PCOS (Dumesic et\u00a0al., 2015 ). The present study showed that empagliflozin, metformin monotreatment, and combined drug treatment of PCO\u2010IR rat model for 28\u2009days exhibited similar significant improvement in the elevated BMI with no added significant effect for the combined treatment over single modality.  Our results are in line with previous studies, which showed that taking metformin can reduce BMI in PCOS patients (Li et\u00a0al., 2020 ; Tan et\u00a0al., 2008 ). The Diabetes Prevention Program reveals that the main weight\u2010loss mechanisms of metformin is through improving IR and reducing food intake (Yerevanian & Soukas, 2019 ). It has been shown that circadian rhythm and gastrointestinal physiology changes caused by metformin also help in controlling fat oxidation and storage in the liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissues (Bridgeman et\u00a0al., 2018 ; Malin & Kashyap, 2014 ).  Furthermore, a growing body of evidence has shown that SGLT2 inhibitors decrease body and fat mass by enhancing fat oxidation and caloric loss through glycosuria. They can also activate lipolysis, and thus promote higher fat utilization, in obese animal models (Obata et\u00a0al., 2016 ; Osataphan et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2014 ; Yokono et\u00a0al., 2014 ). Xu and Osataphan have reported, FGF21 seems to mediate, at least in part, SGLT2 inhibitor\u2010induced activation of lipolysis in adipose tissue (Osataphan et\u00a0al., 2019 ; Xu et\u00a0al., 2017 ).  In this study, We observed that both metformin and empagliflozin can improve the endocrine and metabolic functioning in rats with PCOS\u2010IR via the AMPK\u2010SIRT1 pathway which may be the molecular basis for IR in PCOS and may potentially be a therapeutic target. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of metformin in improving metabolic outcomes in PCOS, despite the fact that it lacks a license for this use. SGLT\u20102 inhibitors are also promising therapeutics that have been shown significant advantages in improving metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS, however their roles and pathways in improving PCOS metabolic and hormonal disturbances need further studies. It is crucial to recognize that no single treatment can cover the whole metabolic disorders in women with PCOS, so, combination of more than single modality to improve the parameters of metabolic disorders is highly recommended.
