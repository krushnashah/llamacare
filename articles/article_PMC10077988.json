With circulating hormones known to profoundly influence maternal responses in females, we aimed to determine whether maternal behaviour is altered in a well\u2010described prenatally androgenised (PNA) mouse model of PCOS. Mouse dams were administered with dihydrotestosterone or vehicle on days 16, 17 and 18 of pregnancy. Maternal responses were assessed in both the dihydrotestosterone\u2010injected dams following parturition and in their adult female PNA offspring. Exposure of dams to excess androgens during late pregnancy had no detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes, including gestation length, pup survival and gestational weight gain, or on subsequent maternal behaviour following parturition. By contrast, PNA virgin females, modelling PCOS, exhibited enhanced maternal behaviour when tested in an anxiogenic novel cage environment, with females rapidly retrieving pups and nesting with them. In comparison, most control virgin females failed to complete this retrieval task in the anxiogenic environment. Assessment of progesterone receptor and oestrogen receptor \u03b1 immunoreactivity in the brains of virgin PNA and control females revealed increased numbers of oestrogen receptor \u03b1 positive cells in the brains of PNA females in regions well known to be important for maternal behaviour. This suggests that increased oestrogenic signalling in the neural circuit that underlies maternal behaviour may be a possible mechanism by which maternal behaviour is enhanced in PNA female mice.

    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age and affects approximately 6%\u201316% of women worldwide.  1  ,  2  This condition, characterised by oligo\u2010 or anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology and hyperandrogenism,  3  is associated with high rates of sub or infertility as well as metabolic complications.  4  Clearly, PCOS pathology involves several different organ systems, including the ovaries and brain.  5  ,  6  A hallmark feature of PCOS,  7  hyperandrogenism, is also hypothesised to be an underlying mechanism driving the development of the condition in utero.  8  ,  9  ,  10  In women with PCOS, hyperandrogenaemia is found in 60%\u201380% of women, and hyperandrogenaemia remains significantly elevated during pregnancy.  11  ,  12  Furthermore, the daughters of women with PCOS are more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS themselves,  13  supporting the hypothesis that high androgen exposure during prenatal development contributes to PCOS development.  14  The generation of animal models that successfully replicate the pathophysiology of PCOS has enabled investigation into the aetiology of this disease, and is most commonly modelled in animals through prenatal exposure to androgens during critical periods of development.  8    In non\u2010human primates, sheep, rats and mice, prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure replicates many of the reproductive features of PCOS.  15  ,  16  ,  17  ,  18  Within the animal models of PCOS, mice have become well\u2010utilised, with the generation of transgenic tools enabling detailed mechanistic studies to be undertaken. We and others have previously shown that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment to late pregnant mice leads to development of the hallmark features of PCOS in the female offspring (PNA mice), including hyperandrogenism, disrupted oestrous cyclicity, markedly impaired fertility, altered ovarian morphology, impaired steroid hormone feedback and hyperactive gonadotropin secretion.  18  ,  19  ,  20  PNA exposure in this model has been shown to significantly alter the neuronal network controlling reproduction.  20  PNA is known to drive changes in steroid hormone receptor expression and changes in the organisation of GABAergic synaptic innervation and neurotransmission  20  Altogether, this illustrates the ability of PNA exposure to induce significant changes to specific neural circuits.  In addition to reproductive dysfunction, it has more recently emerged that PCOS in women is also linked to a higher incidence of mood disorders including anxiety and depression.  4  ,  21  ,  22  In mothers, PCOS is associated with higher incidence of postpartum depressed mood or anhedonia.  23  ,  24  Increased androgen signalling in the brain is thought to underpin these features.  25  In animal models of PCOS, behavioural disruptions have been comparatively understudied compared to reproductive and metabolic deficits. In both female mice and rats, prenatal DHT or testosterone treatment has been shown to result in increased anxiety\u2010like behaviour when tested in an elevated plus maze or open field.  26  ,  27  Together, these human and animal studies warrant further investigation into the potential behaviour impacts of prenatal androgen excess associated with PCOS development. The focus of the present study is to investigate whether maternal behaviour, which is highly affected by levels of circulating hormones, is altered in an established mouse DHT\u2010treatment model of PCOS. Initially, we aimed to investigate whether deficits in maternal behaviour arise following DHT treatment in late pregnant mice. Second, we aimed to investigate whether maternal behaviour is disrupted in the female PNA offspring, which display PCOS\u2010like endocrine disruptions.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Animals and tissue collection  Adult C57Bl/6 inbred female mice (age 8\u201316\u2009weeks), originally sourced from Jackson Laboratory, were group housed under conditions of controlled temperature (22\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and lighting (12:12\u2009h light/dark photocycle, lights on 6:00 am ), with ad libitum access to food and water. PNA mice for modelling PCOS were generated as previously described.  18  ,  19  Briefly, two groups of pregnant dams were generated by mating individually\u2010housed 8\u201310\u2010week\u2010old wildtype female C57Bl/6 with C57Bl/6 stud males. The presence of a vaginal mucus plug was counted as day 1 of pregnancy, and the male was removed from the cage and the female individually housed throughout pregnancy and lactation. Females were weighed daily until gestation day 18. Pregnant dams received daily injections of either vehicle (sesame oil) or 250\u2009\u03bcg of 5\u03b1\u2010androstan\u201017\u03b2\u2010ol\u20103\u2010one (free dihydrotestosterone, DHT; A8380; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in sesame oil (s.c., 2.5\u00a0mg\u2009mL \u22121 ) on gestation days 16, 17 and 18 ( n =\u00a08 per group). Pregnant dams were weighed daily from day 1\u201318 of pregnancy, and day of parturition (counted as day 1 of lactation), as well as litter size at birth and at day 3 lactation, were recorded. Litter sizes were standardised to 5\u20137 pups on day 3 of lactation. Postpartum maternal behaviour of vehicle and DHT\u2010treated dams was assessed on days 3 and 5 of lactation.  Control and PNA offspring born to vehicle\u2010treated and DHT\u2010treated dams, respectively, were weaned on postnatal day 21 and the female offspring were group\u2010housed with littermates. At 8\u2009weeks of age, control and PNA females ( n =\u00a011\u201312 per group) were individually housed, and oestrous cycles were monitored by daily vaginal cytology to confirm the acyclic phenotype of PNA mice. Vaginal cells were collected for cytological assessment between 9:00 and 10:00 am through aspiration of saline into the vagina. Cells were stained with Toluidine blue and cell morphology and density used to determine oestrous cycle state.  28  At 9\u2009weeks of age, maternal behaviour was assessed in virgin control and PNA offspring, and behaviour scored in 10 control and 10 PNA offspring (Figure 1 ). Two weeks following behavioural testing, six control and six PNA females were exposed to foster pups in the home cage for 30\u2009min, and six control and five PNA female mice underwent the same procedure but no pups were introduced. Ninety\u2009min following introduction of foster pups, mice were anaesthetised with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, postfixed for 1\u00a0h in the same fixative and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight. Brains were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioned. The University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee approved all of the experimental procedures conducted with animals.   FIGURE 1   Experimental timeline of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or vehicle treatment to pregnant dams and maternal behavioural testing. DHT or vehicle was administered (s.c.) on days 16, 17 and 18 of pregnancy (A). Day of parturition was counted as day 1 of lactation and maternal behaviour was tested in the home cage (day 3 of lactation) and novel cage (day 5 of lactation) (A). Pups from DHT or vehicle\u2010administered dams were weaned on day 21 of lactation and female offspring group housed until aged 8\u2009weeks. At 8\u2009weeks of age, females were individually housed and maternal behaviour tested in the home cage (day 8) and novel cage (day 10) (B). Two weeks following maternal behavioural testing, females were exposed to either foster pups or no pups and transcardially perfused 60\u2009min following cessation of exposure (B)       2.2  Maternal behaviour testing  Pup\u2010directed maternal responses were tested in both the home cage and in a novel cage. A novel cage is an anxiogenic environment and therefore, provides a more rigorous test of maternal behaviour.  29  ,  30  We have previously reported that dams take longer to retrieve pups in a novel cage.  31  All behavioural tests were recorded by video camera and subsequently scored by an experimenter who was blinded to treatment group.    2.3  Home cage pup retrieval test  Pup retrieval behaviour was tested in home cages on day 3 of lactation in vehicle and DHT\u2010treated dams and at 9\u2009weeks of age in virgin control and PNA female offspring (Figure 1 ). Between 9:00 and 11:00 am , female mice were habituated to a testing room for 30\u2009min and pups were removed from the home cages of lactating dams during testing. Three foster pups (3\u20135\u2009days old; aged\u2010matched for lactating dams) were placed into the three corners of the cage at the opposite end from the nest and all pup\u2010directed behaviours were recorded for 30\u2009min. Behaviours analysed during this test included latency to approach each pup (defined as the first time the nose of the female visually touched the pup), latency to retrieve each pup to the nest, grouping of pups in the nest and the time to reach kyphosis (arching of the back into a nursing position). In both a home and novel cage, virgin females did not assume kyphotic positions, as defined previously,  32  but continued to move nesting material and investigate pups once in the nest, therefore latency to nest with pups has been reported rather than kyphosis. After testing, pups were returned to their home cages.    2.4  Novel cage pup retrieval test  Pup retrieval behaviour was tested in novel cages between 9:00 and 11:00 am on day 5 of lactation in dams and 2\u2009days following home cage testing in virgin females (Figure 1 ). Females were placed in a clean, novel cage and allowed to habituate for 10\u00a0min. Three pups were placed into three corners of the cage and pup\u2010directed behaviours were recorded for 60\u2009min in the dams and for 90\u2009min in the virgin female groups. We have previously shown that virgin females display lower levels of maternal motivation to interact with pups  33  ; therefore, they were given longer to complete the retrieval task. Behaviours analysed during this test included latency to approach and retrieve each pup, time taken to gather all three pups together and the time to reach kyphosis (only assessed for groups of lactating dams). In the absence of an established nest in the novel cage test, female mice frequently retrieved one pup to the location of another pup, without actively retrieving all pups. Therefore, for novel cage testing, only retrieval for the first pup, along with the latency to have all three pups gathered together, and latency to nest with pups has been reported. After testing, female mice were returned to their home cage.    2.5  Immunohistochemistry  To identify a potential mechanism by which PNA females show enhanced maternal behaviour, we investigated whether there were differences in pup exposure\u2010induced neuronal activation (measured by cFos immunolabelling) between PNA and control females. Immunohistochemical labelling for cFos has extensively been used as a marker of maternal behaviour\u2010induced neuronal activation.  34  ,  35  ,  36  ,  37  Levels of cFos protein peak between 1 and 3\u00a0h following exposure to a stimuli  38  ; therefore animals were transcardially perfused 90\u2009min following first exposure to foster pups to evaluate cFos immunoreactivity. Previous studies have shown altered expression of progestrone (PR) and oestrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1 in the brain of PNA female mice in areas associated with fertility regulation.  20  With both progesterone and oestrogen known to be regulators of maternal behaviour, we also assessed whether there were changes in the immunolabelling of PR and ER\u03b1 in regions of the brain known to regulate maternal behaviour.  39  ,  40    Three sets of 30\u2010\u03bcm thick coronal sections through the forebrain from each animal were cut using a sliding microtome. Separate sets of brain tissue were used to label cFos (a marker of neuronal activation), PR and ER\u03b1 by immunohistochemistry. To label cFos immunoreactivity, tissue was incubated in rabbit anti\u2010cFos primary antibody (dilution 1:5000; #190289; Abcam, Cambridge UK  37  ) for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then incubated in biotinylated goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG (dilution 1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 60\u2009min, followed by a 90\u2010min incubation in Vector Elite avidin\u2010biotin\u2010horseradish peroxidase complex (dilution 1:100). Peroxidase labelling was visualised with nickel\u2010diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride using glucose oxidase to create a black nuclear precipitate. This procedure was replicated on separate sets of tissues to immunolabel PR and ER\u03b1, using a rabbit anti\u2010progesterone receptor primary antibody (dilution 1:2000; Dako Corp., Glostrup, Denmark  20  ) and a rabbit anti\u2010ER\u03b1 primary antibody (dilution 1:10,000; Millipore 06\u2010935; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany  20  ), respectively. For each immunohistochemical experiment, negative controls were included where omission of primary antisera resulted in complete absence of the respective immunoreactivity.  Sections were analysed using a BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Gryphax NOS camera (Jenoptik, Jena, Germany) using brightfield microscopy using a 20\u00d7 objective. Image settings were determined for each immunolabel and kept constant between sections and animals. Nuclei with positive immunolabelling were counted using ImageJ (NIH, Bethseda, MD, USA) bilaterally in each section and the experimenter was blinded to treatment group for analysis. Briefly, images were thresholded with threshold parameters determined for each immunolabel and kept constant between sections and animals. Positive immunolabelling was identified using the analyse particle function in two anatomically\u2010matched sections per region per animal, with the average nuclei counts in the region of interest reported per 30\u2010\u03bcm thick section.  20  ,  37  ,  41  Analysis of cFos immunolabelling was undertaken in the anteroventral periventricular area (AVPV) (Bregma 0.26\u20130.38\u2009mm), medial preoptic area (MPOA) (Bregma \u22120.10 to 0.14\u2009mm), bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) (Bregma \u22120.10 to \u22120.22\u2009mm) and the medial amygdala (MEA) (Bregma \u22121.94 to \u22122.06\u2009mm).  42  Within the BNST, cFos and ER\u03b1 immunolabelling was observed in the medial division, ventral part of the medial division, posteromedial part of the medial division, dorsal part of the lateral division and the ventral part of the lateral division. For analysis of positive cFos and ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity, labelling from all these subdivisions was counted in the BNST. Within the medial amygdala, immunolabelling for cFos and ER\u03b1 were observed and counted in both the posteroventral and posterodorsal medial amygdala. These regions were selected based on assessment of immunolabelling present and previous reports of pup interaction\u2010induced cFos immunolabelling in the rodent brain.  36  Analysis of PR immunolabelling was undertaken in the AVPV, MPOA, arcuate nucleus (Bregma \u22121.70 to \u22121.94\u2009mm) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (Bregma \u22121.82 to \u22121.94\u2009mm). Very few nuclei that were immunopositive for PR were observed in the BNST or MEA; therefore, cell counts are not reported in this regions. Analysis of ER\u03b1 immunolabelling was undertaken in the AVPV, MPOA, BNST and MEA.    2.6  Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using Prism, version 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM for normally distributed data and the median\u2009\u00b1\u2009interquartile range for non\u2010normally distributed data. p <\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant. All data sets (apart from latency measures) were first tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, where p <\u2009.05 was considered as not normally distributed. Normal distribution was confirmed for weight gain during pregnancy, pup\u2010directed approach behaviour of virgins in the novel cage, and PR and ER\u03b1 immunolabelling. When a normal distribution was confirmed, further analysis was performed using parametric unpaired two\u2010tailed t tests with Welch's correction (to account for differing population variance or sample size). Normal distribution was not confirmed for gestation length, number of pups, percent of time in oestrous cycle stage, pup\u2010directed approach and retrieval behaviour, and gathering of pups by dams in home and novel cages and for virgins in the home cage. Therefore, all of these data were analysed using the non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test. Latency to gather pups to nest and to reach kyphosis were analysed using survival analysis as a result of the high proportion of censored data (animals that failed to complete the task within the duration of the test), and curve comparison was undertaken using the Mantel\u2013Cox log\u2010rank test. The proportion of control and PNA females successfully gathering pups together in the novel cage was analysed by Fisher's exact test. Pup\u2010exposure induced differences in cFos immunoreactivity between control and PNA females were compared in each brain region by two\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to identify statistically significant changes. N\u2009min of pup exposure had no effect on levels of PR or ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity; therefore, pup\u2010exposed ( n =\u00a06 per group) and non\u2010exposed ( n =\u00a05\u20136 per group) groups were combined to compare levels of immunoreactivity between control and PNA females using parametric unpaired two\u2010tailed t tests with Welch's correction. For each brain region, the comparison of interest was the immunoreactive cell counts between PNA and control groups. Different brain regions were not compared with each other. Full statistical tables are provided in the Supporting information (Tables S1 ).     3  RESULTS   3.1   DHT \u2010treatment during late pregnancy does not affect pregnancy outcomes  To assess whether DHT\u2010treatment during pregnancy days 16\u201318 detrimentally affected pregnancy outcomes, gestation length, pregnancy weight gain and pup survival were monitored. There were no differences in any of these parameters between vehicle\u2010treated and DHT\u2010treated pregnant females (Figure 2A\u2013C ; see also Supporting information, Table S1 ). Successful DHT treatment to model PCOS was confirmed by the marked disruption in oestrous cyclicity that was observed in female PNA offspring once they reached 8\u201310\u2009weeks of age compared to control females (offspring of vehicle\u2010treated pregnant dams) (Figure 2D\u2013F ; see also Supporting information, Table S1 ). Consistent with previous reports,  18  ,  19  PNA females spent significantly m time in diestrus compared to control females (80.70%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.21% vs. 44.01%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.92%, respectively; p <\u2009.0001, Mann\u2013Whitney test) and pro\u2010oestrous cytology was rarely observed in only two out of 10 PNA females (Figure 2F ).   FIGURE 2   Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment during late pregnancy has no detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes in a mouse model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DHT treatment on days 16, 17 and 18 of pregnancy had no effect on gestation length (A; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009interquartile range [IR]), total weight gain during pregnancy (B; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009IR) or number of live pups per litter on day three of lactation (C; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009confidence interval [CI]) ( n =\u00a08 per group). DHT treatment led to the successful generation of PNA female offspring (D\u2013F; mean\u2009\u00b1\u200995% CI). Adult control females (green) showed normal oestrous cycles, with severely disrupted cycles observed in prenatally androgenised (PNA) females (purple) ( n =\u00a010 per group)       3.2   DHT \u2010treatment during late pregnancy does not adversely affect maternal behaviour during lactation  Postpartum maternal behaviour was tested in dams that received either vehicle\u2010 or DHT\u2010treatment in late pregnancy. First, pup\u2010directed maternal responses were examined in the home cage on day 3 of lactation. All dams approached and successfully retrieved the first foster pup to the nest, with only one vehicle\u2010treated female failing to approach and retrieve the second and third foster pups (Figure 3A,B ; see also Supporting information, Table S2 ). Although, the DHT\u2010treated dams were significantly faster to approach the second pup and to retrieve the first and second pups than the vehicle\u2010treated dams, this is likely a result of the failure of one dam (out of eight) to approach and retrieve pups in the vehicle\u2010treated group (Figure 3A,B ). There were no significant differences in the latency to gather all three foster pups to the nest or to reach kyphosis (Figure 3C,D ; see also Supporting information, Table S2 ). On day 5 of lactation, pup\u2010directed maternal responses were tested in a novel cage, with the anxiogenic environment being a more rigorous test of maternal behaviour.  29  As reported previously,  31  dams took longer to retrieve pups, with more dams failing to complete this task in a novel cage (Figure 3E\u2013H ). There were no differences between vehicle\u2010 and DHT\u2010treated dams in the time taken to approach and retrieve pups or to gather pups in the nest (Figure 3E\u2013G ; see also Supporting information, Table S2 ). In this novel environment, only two out of eight vehicle\u2010treated dams reached kyphosis in the duration of the 60\u2009min test (Figure 3H ; see also Supporting information, Table S2 ). Together, these data suggest that DHT\u2010treatment during pregnancy does not adversely affect postpartum maternal behaviour.   FIGURE 3   No disruption of maternal behaviour following dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\u2010treatment to pregnant dams. Maternal behaviour was tested in the home cage on day 3 of lactation (A\u2013D) and in a novel clean cage on day 5 of lactation (E, F) in groups of mice treated with vehicle or DHT during late pregnancy ( n =\u00a08 per group). Mean latency to approach (A, E; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009interquartile range [IR]) and retrieve (B, F) each pup was recorded and cumulative percentage of mice from each group to gather pups together (C, G) and reach kyphosis (D, H). Grey bars in (A), (B) and (F) indicate the length of each test where at least one animal failed to complete the behavioural task       3.3   PNA virgin females display enhanced maternal responses in a novel environment  The impact of prenatal androgen exposure on subsequent adult maternal behaviour was assessed in virgin PNA female mice in response to foster pups. Although it appears that reproductive function may be rescued following long\u2010term anti\u2010androgen treatment,  18  ,  43  the vast majority of PNA mice are infertile. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether the infertile, untreated, hyperandrogenic PCOS\u2010like model was accompanied by altered maternal behavioural responses to foster pups. When tested in the home cage, pup\u2010directed maternal behaviour was only subtly different between PNA and control females (Figure 4A\u2013D ; see also Supporting information, Table S3 ). PNA females were significantly slower to approach the third pup; however, there were no differences in the time taken to retrieve all three pups or to gather pups in the nest between groups (Figure 4A\u2013D ; see also Supporting information, Table S3 ). In both PNA and control groups, nine out of 10 females retrieved all three pups to the nest (Figure 3C ). Surprisingly, when tested 2\u2009days later in a novel cage, PNA females showed markedly higher levels of maternal behaviour than control females (Figure 4E\u2013H ; see also Supporting information, Table S3 ). Although pup approach was not different between groups, only five out of 10 control females retrieved the first pup compared to nine out of 10 PNA females (Figure 4F,G ). PNA females showed reduced latencies to retrieve the first pup and gather all pups in the nest compared to control females (Retrieval of first pup: \u03c7 2 =\u00a04.173, df =\u00a01, p =\u00a0.0411; all pups gathered: \u03c7 2 =\u00a07.541, df =\u00a01, p =\u00a00.006; Mantel\u2013Cox log\u2010rank tests). PNA females also showed much reduced latencies to nest with the foster pups (\u03c7 2 =\u00a08.060, df =\u00a01, p =\u00a0.005; Mantel\u2013Cox log\u2010rank tests), with significantly more PNA females completing this behaviour within the duration of the test compared to control females (nine out of 10 PNA females compared to three out of 10 control females, p =\u00a0.0198, Fisher's exact test) (Figure 4H ).   FIGURE 4   Enhanced pup retrieval behaviour by adult virgin PNA females in a novel cage. Maternal behaviour was tested in the home cage (A\u2013D) and 2\u2009days later, in a novel clean cage (E\u2013H) in groups of control and PNA female mice ( n =\u00a010 per group). Mean latency to approach (A, E; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009interquartile range [IR]) and retrieve (B, F; median\u2009\u00b1\u2009IR) each pup was recorded and cumulative percentage of mice from each group to nest with the pups (D, H). Note that only five of 10 and four of 10 of control females successfully retrieved one pup and gathered the pups together in the novel cage, compared to nine of 10 PNA females (F, G). Grey bars in (B) and (F) indicate the length of each test where at least one animal failed to complete the behavioural task       3.4  Pup exposure induces cFos immunoreactivity in both PNA and control females, with no difference between these groups  In both control and PNA females, pup exposure in the home cage induced a significant increase in cFos immunoreactivity in the MPOA, from 51.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8 to 127.7\u2009\u00b1\u200915.1 positively labelled cFos nuclei following pup exposure in control mice and from 70.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2 to 126.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1 positively labelled cFos nuclei in PNA females (two\u2010way ANOVA, no effect of DHT treatment p =\u00a0.462; significant effect of pup exposure, p <\u2009.0001; no significant interaction, p =\u00a0.398) (Figure 5A\u2013C ; see also Supporting information, Table S 4). No significant differences in cFos immunolabelling following pup exposure were observed in the AVPV, BNST or MEA in either control of PNA mice (Figure 5D\u2013F ; see also Supporting information, Table S4 ).

We initially investigated the pregnant dams in which the PNA model is produced and found that exposure to the non\u2010aromatisable androgen DHT during late pregnancy has no detrimental effects on their pregnancy outcomes or on their subsequent maternal behaviour following parturition. Importantly, this implies that any altered behaviours in the offspring are unlikely to result from altered maternal care that they received as pups, but rather to be a consequence of their own PNA programming and phenotype. Unexpectedly, in the PNA offspring that model PCOS, we observed enhanced maternal behaviour. In an anxiogenic environment, PNA virgin females rapidly retrieved pups and spent increased time with them in the nest. Our data showed that, although the general activation of maternal behaviour\u2010related brain circuits was not different in the brains of virgin PNA female mice, ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity was increased, suggesting a possible mechanism by which maternal behaviour is altered in PNA female mice. It is important to note that maternal behaviour in the female PNA offspring was only evaluated in virgin females (as a result of impaired fertility in this model). It is not currently known whether postpartum maternal behaviour in the PNA female offspring would be altered in this model.  The enhanced maternal behaviour observed in PNA female mice was only observed when tested in a novel and clean cage. Unlike rats, virgin female mice of most strains have been shown to rapidly retrieve pups in a home cage,  44  and it is unlikely that further improvements in this behaviour would be detectable under these conditions. For example, we have previously reported impaired retrieval behaviour in dams with a GABA neuron\u2010specific deletion of the prolactin receptor, although this was only observed in a novel but not the home cage.  31  ,  33  In both rat and mouse PCOS models that utilise DHT\u2010treatment in late pregnancy, the female PNA offspring have been shown to display increased anxiety\u2010like behaviour in an elevated plus maze.  26  ,  27  ,  45  This anxiety\u2010like phenotype of PNA females in a mouse model of PCOS is consistent with human data showing increased rates of anxiety in women with PCOS.  21  ,  46  Although not assessed in the present study, given that the mouse strain, DHT\u2010treatment regime and behavioural testing conditions were consistent with these prior mouse studies,  26  ,  45  we would predict that anxiety\u2010related behaviour would also have been elevated in the PNA female mice used in the present study. The observed increased maternal behaviour in an anxiogenic environment in the present study is therefore more remarkable, and indicates that maternal behaviour is specifically increased in this PCOS model rather than resulting from an indirect effect mediated through lowered anxiety. It would be of interest for future studies to examine whether increased maternal motivation, the high responsiveness to offspring\u2010related stimuli combined with a strong drive to seek out these stimuli,  47  ,  48  ,  49  is underlying the enhanced maternal behaviour of PNA female mice.  With oestrogens known to be an important regulator of maternal behaviour,  39  ,  40  one potential mechanism that could explain enhanced maternal behaviour in PNA female mice is increased levels of ER\u03b1 expression. In the present study, we showed increased numbers of ER\u03b1 positive immunoreactive cells in the AVPV, BNST and MEA of PNA female mice, with all these regions known to be important in regulating maternal behaviour. The role of oestrogen signalling in maternal behaviour is most well characterised in the MPOA, where we saw a trend but not a significant increase in ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity in PNA females. In the MPOA, ER\u03b1 positive cells project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), part of the reward circuitry of the brain, and are important mediators of pup approach and retrieval behaviours.  50  Although not investigated in the present study, little or no ER\u03b1 expression has been reported in the VTA of female rodents,  51  ,  52  suggesting that oestrogen action through ER\u03b1 in the VTA would need to occur via an indirect mechanism. In the BNST and MPOA, a clear correlation has been shown between low numbers of ER\u03b1 positive cells and poor maternal behaviour in a mandarin vole model of early life deprivation.  53    In addition to retrieval behaviour, oestrogen signalling also appears to be important for nest building behaviour, with oestradiol implants in the MPOA and BNST stimulating maternal nest building behaviour in rabbits.  54  In light of these studies, increased ER\u03b1 signalling is one potential mechanism underlying the enhanced retrieval and nesting behaviour of PNA females seen in the present study. It is important to note that, although ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity was reported to increase collectively in the BNST in the present study, immunoreactivity was observed in multiple subdivisions of the BNST. Oestrogen action through differential ER\u03b1 expression in specific subdivisions of the BNST in PNA mice could be altering selective aspects of maternal behaviour, with the subdivisions having distinct neural connections and physiological roles.  55  It has also recently been reported that progesterone exposure alone is able to induce pregnancy\u2010like nest building behaviour through actions mediated by cocaine\u2010 and amphetamine\u2010regulated transcript neurons in the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus.  56  Although PR immunolabelling in the Edinger\u2013Westphal nucleus was not studied in the present study, we observed no change in PR immunoreactivity in any of the other brain regions examined. This suggests that altered progesterone receptor expression is unlikely to be contributing to altered maternal behaviour in PNA mice in the present study. We also observed increased ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity in the MeA of PNA virgin females. Although lesioning studies led to the long\u2010held belief that the MeA suppresses maternal behaviour,  57  ,  58  ,  59  a recent study showed that optogenetic stimulation of a subset of MeA neurons can induce pup grooming and retrieval behaviour.  60  It would be of interest to investigate whether there is a role for ER\u03b1 signalling within the MeA on promoting pup\u2010directed responses. Increased oestrogen signalling could also be acting indirectly to promote maternal behaviour in PNA female mice. It has previously been shown that oestradiol administration enhances the anxiolytic actions of oxytocin,  61  and increases levels of oxytocin receptor binding in the MPOA.  62  Together, these studies suggest that further investigation into whether elevated levels of ER\u03b1 immunoreactivity can facilitate improved maternal behaviour are warranted.  Accompanying the increase in ER\u03b1 expression, there may also be an increase in the availability of oestradiol to act on the receptor. Replicating that seen in women with PCOS, PNA female mice have high levels of circulating testosterone,  18  ,  19  which, in the presence of aromatase, is converted into oestradiol. Aromatase expression has been reported in the BNST, MPOA and MeA of both male and female adult mice, with the highest numbers of aromatase\u2010expressing cell bodies in females located in the BNST and MeA.  63  Interestingly, in both the BNST and MEA, it was reported that 60% of aromatase\u2010expressing cells in females also co\u2010express ER\u03b1.  63  In ovariectomised mice, treatment with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, impaired pup retrieval and nest building behaviour,  64  suggesting that local oestrogen production is contributing to maternal behaviour. Investigations into aromatase activity throughout the brain of PNA mice could provide valuable insights into whether local increases in oestrogen signalling may be occurring. Altered ER\u03b1 signalling could also account for why enhanced maternal behaviour was seen in PNA offspring, but not in the DHT\u2010treated dams. The treatment of dams in the present study, with the non\u2010aromatisable DHT, specifically increased androgen receptor\u2010mediated effects (or androgen actions), without necessarily changing circulating oestrogen levels or local oestrogen production through aromatisation.  In addition to progesterone and oestrogen, androgens also modulate maternal behaviour. With hyperandrogenism being a key feature in clinical PCOS and the basis for most preclinical animal models of the disorder, it is important to consider potential effects of elevated androgens on mammalian maternal behaviour. A recent RNA\u2010sequencing analysis of the MPOA of lactating rats with and without pups, showed that androgen receptor (AR) expression is downregulated in the presence of pups.  65  In that same study, central administration of an AR antagonist to rat dams increased pup\u2010directed behaviour,  65  suggesting that AR\u2010signalling in the brain suppresses normal postpartum maternal behaviour. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of androgen administration during pregnancy on subsequent maternal behaviour in mammals. One study, conducted in the 1970s, administered testosterone during mid\u2010late gestation in rabbits, and reported no impact on postpartum maternal behaviour.  66  Consistent with this finding by Anderson et al.,  66  impaired maternal behaviour in dams following late pregnancy administration of DHT was not observed in the present study, suggesting that postpartum circulating levels of androgens are unlikely to be elevated in these mice. In apparently contradictory findings, co\u2010treatment of testosterone and progesterone to virgin female rats has been shown to increase pup\u2010directed behaviour.  67  However, this appeared to occur via an oestrogen\u2010dependent mechanism, rather than directly mediated by androgens, because increased pup\u2010directed behaviour was blocked in the presence of an aromatase inhibitor.  67  In the female offspring of mothers exposed to elevated androgens during pregnancy, poor nest building behaviour has been reported in adult virgin rabbits.  66  Nest building was not investigated in the present study, but pup\u2010directed behaviour was clearly not negatively affected in PNA female mice, despite the hyperandrogenism phenotype in this PCOS model.  19  ,  43    Together, these data provide the first description of maternal behaviour both in mouse dams treated with DHT during pregnancy and in the female PNA offspring. Such data can provide confidence to researchers employing prenatal androgen excess models with respect to the maternal behaviour of exposed dams not being compromised. In addition, enhanced pup retrieval behaviour in virgin PNA females when tested in an anxiogenic environment was an interesting observation especially given the anxiety\u2010like behaviour reported in this model that mirrors the elevated frequency of anxiety in women with PCOS. Our findings in the brain suggest enhanced signalling through ER\u03b1 in regions of the brain important for maternal behaviour may underlie these responses.
