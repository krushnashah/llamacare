    "body": "Introduction  Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) frequently present cardiovascular\nautonomic control impairments, mainly characterized by a cardiac autonomic imbalance\nin determining heart rate variability (HRV). 1 - 4 This imbalance is an important cardiovascular diseases risk\npredictor. 5 - 7 The autonomic impairment causes are still not well established.\nSome studies suggest that they are result of hormonal and metabolic disorders due\nPCOS, such as insulin resistance increased. 2 , 3 , 8 On\nthe other hand, it is possible that they are simply due body fat percentage\nincrease, which triggers series of systemic alterations, including metabolic and\ncardiovascular, that affect the cardiac autonomic control. 4 , 9 , 10  Another important aspect is that only HRV is frequently investigated in these women,\nand we know little about PCOS effects on others autonomic parameters, such as\nbaroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and blood pressure variability (BPV). More\nspecifically, there are no studies associating PCOS to BPV, and in BRS case, studies\nare incipient. On this, only one study was performed and found no\ndifferences. 11 However,\nthis study only addressed obese PCOS and non-PCOS women, which limited further\nfindings.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate spontaneous BRS and BPV in\neutrophic PCOS women and to investigate the contribution of obesity to these\nautonomic parameters in these women.    Methods   Participants  With a convenience sample, ninety volunteers aged between 18 and 39 years were\nincluded, 30 non PCOS women, considered as a control group, and 60 PCOS women,\naccording to Rotterdam consensus, 12 were subdivided according to the body mass index (BMI):\neutrophic group (30 women) and obese group (30 women). All of them were\nsedentary, did not use any medication, and were screened at the outpatient\nclinic of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of Clinical Hospital of Ribeirao\nPreto Medical School (HC-FMRP/USP).    Polycystic ovary syndrome diagnostic  Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound was performed with the Voluson 730 Expert Machine\n(GE Medical Systems, ZIPF, Austria) to analysis the cysts presence or absence.\nThe ovarian volume and follicles number/size were evaluated, and to calculate\novarian volume the prolate ellipsoid formula (depth x width x length x 0.5) was\nused. 13  In addition, laboratory tests for serum total testosterone, androstenedione, sex\nhormone binding globulin and free androgen, prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone\nand thyrotropin dosed to diagnose exclusion causes. Blood samples were collected\nduring the follicular phase in women with regular ovulatory cycles and at any\ntime in those with irregular cycles. All the above examinations were performed\nat the Gynecology Laboratory of HC-FMRP, between 07h00 and 09h00 a.m. after a\nprevious 12-hour fast.    Ergospirometric test  The peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak ) was assessed by a submaximal exercise\ntest on a treadmill (Super ATL Millenium\u00ae, Inbramed/Inbrasport, Brazil)\nusing the Modificated Bruce protocol. The analysis of exhaled gases\n(VO 2 and VCO 2 ) was performed using a metabolic device\n(UltimaTM CardiO 2 , Medical\nGraphics Corp., USA).    Anthropometric parameters  Body weight and height were obtained using an analogue scale with an altimeter\n(Welmy), while the body mass index (BMI) values were obtained using the formula\nW/H 2 , where W is the weight in kilograms and H is the height of\nthe subject in meters. Body composition was evaluated using the bioelectrical\nimpedance method (Quantum BIA 101; Q-RJL Systems, Clinton Township, Michigan,\nUSA). The groups were subdivided by their BMI, where the eutrophic groups had\nBMI < 25 kg/m 2 and the obese group had BMI > 30\nkg/m 2 . 14    Analysis of the heart rate variability and blood pressure variability  The spectral analysis of HRV was recorded between 09h00 and 10h00 a.m. according\nto the following protocol: after remaining in a supine rest position on\northostatic bed for 20 min, the volunteers were passively placed in an inclined\nposition (75\u00b0 angle) for an additional 10 min. HRV for supine and inclined\npositions (that is, the tilt test) was recorded using an electrocardiogram (AD\nInstruments, Sydney, Australia), and a time series of RR interval (RRi) was\nobtained.  The HRV was obtained using the RRi from electrocardiographic record (ECG),\nthrough the modified MC5 shunt at a sampling frequency of 1000Hz. The BPV data\nvalues were obtained from the systolic arterial pressure (SAP) recorded\nbeat-to-beat by means of digital plethysmography recording equipment, FINOMETER\n(Finometer Pro, Finapress Medical System, Amsterdam, Netherland). The room\ntemperature was kept at 21\u00baC, the ambient light and the noise were controlled,\nto prevent any interference with recording of data.  The BPV and HRV analyses were performed using custom computer software\n(CardioSeries v2.0, http://sites.google.com/site/cardioseries ). The values of the\nRRi and SAP intervals were redesigned in 3 Hz cubic spline interpolation, to\nnormalize the time interval between the beats. The series of interpolated RRi\nand SAP follow the Welch Protocol; 15 they have been divided into half-overlapping sets of 256\ndata points, overlapping 50%. The stationary segment was visually inspected and\nthose with artifacts or transients were excluded. Each RRi and SAP stationary\nsegment were submitted to spectral analysis by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),\nafter Hanning window. The RRi specters were integrated in low frequency (LF;\n0.04 - 0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15 - 0.5 Hz) bands and the results are\nexpressed in absolute (ms 2 ) and normalized units (nu), while the SAP\nspecters were integrated only in low frequency band (LF; 0,04 - 0,15Hz) and the\nresults are expressed in absolute units (mmHg 2 ).  The HRV normalized values were obtained by calculating the percentage of LF and\nHF power related to the total power of spectrum minus the very low-frequency\nband (VLF; < 0.2 Hz). 16 , 17 In addition, normalization procedure was performed to\nminimize variations of total power in the absolute value of LF and HF. 18 To assess the sympathovagal\nbalance, LF/HF ratio of RRi variability was also calculated. 19    Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity  The BRS was assessed in time-domain using the sequence technique, as described by\nDi Rienzo et al., 20 The\ncomputer software CardioSeries v2.4 scanned beat-to-beat time series of RRi and\nSAP values searching for sequences of at least 3 consecutive beats in which;\nprogressive increases in SAP were followed by progressive increases in RRi (up\nsequence) and progressive decreases in SAP were followed by progressive\ndecreases in RRi (down sequence), with a correlation coefficient (r) between RRi\nand SAP values higher than 0.8. The mean slope of the linear regression line\nbetween the SAP and RRi values of each sequence found determined spontaneous\nBRS.    Statistical analysis  In a comparison between two groups the Student's t-test and in comparison of\nthree groups the one ways variance analysis (ANOVA ONE WAY) were performed. The\nShapiro-Wilk test was used to verify de the dates normality; when the\ndistribution was not normal, non-parametric tests were used, the Mann-Whitney\ntest to compare between two groups, and in comparison of three groups, the\nKruskal-Wallis test. When the variables had a normal distribution, they were\ndescribed as mean (\u00b1 standard deviation), and which had non-parametric\ndistribution they were described as median (\u00b1 interquartile range). The\ndifferences in p were less than 5% (p < 0.05) were considered statistically\nsignificant. All statistical tests were performed with Sigma Stat 3.5 software\n(Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).     Results  The volunteer\u2019s anthropometric characteristics and hemodynamic parameters are in Table 1 . The obese PCOS group had higher\nBMI, weight and body fat percentage than the other groups. On the other hand,\nVO 2peak was lower in the obese PCOS group. In relation to blood\npressure, the obese group had higher values of diastolic blood pressure and mean\nblood pressure compared to the control and eutrophic PCOS groups.

Discussion  The present study mainly findings were, at rest the obese PCOS group had lower HRV\nand BRS than the other two groups, BPV was similar across groups.  Regarding hemodynamic values, PCOS obese group showed the highest values of systolic,\ndiastolic and mean blood pressure compared to other groups, despite the fact that\nall subjects were normotensive; some studies had also show a relation with body fat\nincrease and increase BP values. 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 To VO 2peak , the obese PCOS group had the lowest value, similarity to\nliterature, which some authors found a negative correlation between obesity and\nVO2peak. 21 , 22  There are few studies in the literature about obesity and PCOS, which are\ncontradictory, some point to this association as a negative factor in HRV, 3 , 4 although others report that there is\nno association between weight gain and PCOS. 11 , 23 In this sense, the lower HRV found in the obese PCOS group in\nthe present study suggests that this change is due to obesity. The literature\nindicates that the obesity mechanisms may be associated with a reduced sympathetic\nsystem response in the postsynaptic region since they had found in presynaptic cleft\na high sympathetic activity represented by high concentration of\nnoradrenaline. 24 , 25 In addition, a recent study carried out in our laboratory showed low frequency (LF)\nand high frequency (HF) bands differences, in absolute and normalized units, in\nhealthy and sedentary women with normal BMI, overweight and obesity, they verified\nthat the obese group had lower LF and HF oscillations. 10  Regarding BRS, the eutrophic PCOS and control groups presented similar values,\nagreeing with Lambert, 2015, in which the groups had similar BMI and BRS values. In\nrelation to the obese PCOS group, it had the lowest values in all BRS parameters\nthan the others two eutrophic groups, suggesting that obesity may be responsible for\na reduction in BRS. In this sense, a study comparing BRS in women divided by BMI\nindicates a BRS reduction with gain weight, observed by the BRS gain value, in this\nway, the BRS decrease might correlate to weight increase. 26 However, it is known that BRS is also influenced\nby many other factors like insulin resistance, blood glucose, sodium sensibility,\ngenetic markers and ovarian hormones. 27 , 28 In the present study, neither of these other factors were measuring. Thereby it is\npossible to suggest that obesity may influenced in BRS values, as observed in\nanother study, 26 although further\nstudies are needed to confirm these findings in PCOS women.  Finally, in relation to BPV similarity were found between the studied groups, there\nare few information since there are no studies in the literature about the behaviour\nof BPV in PCOS women, the studies found are associated with cardiovascular diseases,\nunrelated to PCOS. 29 - 31 Although, PCOS women have a greater predisposition to develop\ncardiovascular diseases, the present study population were healthy and did not use\nmedication, suggesting that PCOS does not alter the BPV. In addition, the obese PCOS\ngroup also did not present differences in relation to eutrophic groups. The studies\nfound on BPV and obesity are contradictory, some suggest an increase 24 , 32 while others point out a reduction\nof BPV. 33 However, both suggest\nthat the baroreflex could justify these changes. Meanwhile, in our study, although\nthe obese PCOS group presented a decrease in BRS, the BPV, apparently, was not\naffected. In this way, we need more studies to elucidate these findings.   Study limitations  The present study had some limitations, as insulin, glucose and inflammatory\nmarkers dosages absence, which could contribute to results discussion; another\nlimitation was HRV and BPV measure only in supine position. It is possible that\nduring an autonomic provocation test, as in tilt test, we could find different\nresponses in autonomic modulation between the studied groups. However, it is\nimportant to note that the study limitations do not invalidate the main findings\nin supine position and its clinical implications.     Conclusion  Although PCOS is an endocrine-metabolic disease that causes several body changes, it\ndoes not alter the autonomic cardiovascular control. However, the association with\nobesity resulted in a decrease in BRS values, and attenuated the HRV values.\nSuggesting that obesity may play a role in change hemodynamics parameters and\ncardiovascular autonomic control. However, further studies should be conducted to\ninvestigate the effects of metabolic and hormonal changes in these women and the\nassociation of these changes with cardiovascular autonomic control.",
