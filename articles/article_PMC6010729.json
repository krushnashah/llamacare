    "body": "1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common ovulatory disorder among women of childbearing age, with 50% of PCOS patients also being accompanied by infertility. 1 PCOS is often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, lipid metabolic disorders and impaired glucose tolerance. 2 In the in\u00a0vitro fertilization cycle, associations between elevations in total follicular free fatty acids (FFAs) and poor cumulus\u2010oocyte complex quality have been found, suggesting that excess FFAs influence ovarian follicular function. 3 Furthermore, obese women with PCOS undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation have elevated oleic and stearic acid concentrations, which are related to adverse pregnancy outcome. 4 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly those of the n\u22123 and n\u22126 families, are perhaps the most potent fatty acid regulators of metabolic function and are implicated in a diverse range of processes in\u00a0vivo. 5 The prevalence of obesity in women with PCOS is approximately 50%\u201080%, 6 and n\u22123 PUFA supplementation in women with PCOS reduces the plasma bioavailable testosterone, with the greatest reductions being observed in subjects who exhibit greater reductions in plasma n\u22126:n\u22123 PUFA ratios. 7 Furthermore, recent studies have indicated the fatty acid composition of oocytes and their environmental influence on developmental competence and pregnancy outcome. 4 , 8 , 9   Eicosanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes, which are cyclooxygenase (COX)\u2010generated metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), 10 are known to modulate different ovarian functions and luteolysis. 11 , 12 Specifically, PGs are biologically active lipid mediators involved in chronic inflammation and regulation of many reproductive events, such as ovulation, corpus luteum regression, implantation and pregnancy establishment. 13 Alterations in dietary PUFAs can change PUFA contents in the cell membrane and PG synthesis, thus affecting fertility. 14 n\u20103 PUFAs may be effective in improving hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance in patients with PCOS. 15 Elevated concentrations of AA and linoleic acid (LA) in follicular fluid at the time of oocyte retrieval significantly decrease the ability of oocytes to form pronuclei after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, but levels of AA and LA are not associated with subsequent embryo quality or pregnancy rate. 16   As acquisition of patient ovarian tissues is difficult, alterations in ovarian hormonal and metabolic disorders remain poorly defined. Lipidomics, a branch of metabolomics, can systematically investigate a broad range of lipids in one biological system, and research on ovarian PUFAs and their derivates in a PCOS rat model by lipidomics might contribute to a deeper understanding of hormonal and metabolic disorders and their mechanisms.    2  MATERIALS AND METHODS   2.1  Research subjects  Animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Twenty\u2010three 21\u2010day\u2010old female Sprague Dawley rats (50\u201060\u00a0g, Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China) were separately housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) in a temperature\u2010 and humidity\u2010controlled environment. The animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: control (CON, n\u00a0=\u00a08), high\u2010fat diet\u2010fed (HF, n\u00a0=\u00a07), and high\u2010fat diet\u2010fed and andronate\u2010treated (PCOS, n\u00a0=\u00a08). The models were established as previously described. 17 Rats in the PCOS group were fed a high\u2010fat diet and subcutaneously injected with andronate (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) daily at a dose of 1\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g body weight in 0.2\u00a0mL of oil as a vehicle for 8\u00a0weeks, whereas rats of the control group were fed a normal diet and injected with only the vehicle.    2.2  Lipidomics  Solvents for sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, including methanol (MeOH), chloroform (CHCl3) and water, were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (MI, USA). Other HPLC\u2010quality solvents, including methanol, water, 2\u2010propanol, hexane and acetonitrile, were purchased from either Fisher Chemical (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) or EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ, USA). Standards and deuterated standards for AA metabolites, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\u03b1, PGI2, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and used without further purification. Fatty acids of the highest purity (>99%) were purchased from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN, USA). All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).  Fatty acids were analysed as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) according to published protocols. 18 Briefly, FAMEs were separated on an SP\u20102560 capillary column (100\u00a0m\u00a0*\u00a00.25\u00a0mm i.d.\u00a0*\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcm film; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and analysed by gas chromatography\u2010mass spectrophotometry (GC\u2010MS, SHIMADZU, QP 2010 Ultra) in the positive\u2010ion mode of electron impact.  AA metabolites were analysed using a previously reported method. 19 , 20 Briefly, ovarian tissues were dissected, and approximately 10\u00a0mg of each dissected sample was homogenized in 1\u00a0mL of PBS using a tissue grinder (Tissue lyser\u201048). Protein assays were performed on each individual homogenate. The deuterated internal standard mixture was diluted to 0.5\u00a0ng/\u03bcL in ethanol, and 10\u00a0\u03bcL (5\u00a0ng) was added. For metabolites, homogenates of ovarian tissue were extracted after addition of the internal standard mixture. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.0 using 1\u00a0mol/L NH4Ac, and liquid\u2010liquid extraction of the mixture was carried out twice using hexane:methyl t\u2010butyl ether (50:50, v/v). The upper layer was transferred to a new glass tube and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen after centrifugation at 1500 g for 10\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. The residue was dissolved in 50\u00a0\u03bcL of mobile phase A (water:acetonitrile:formic acid, 63:37:0.02, v/v/v) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis.  Samples were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetix C18 column (100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0mm, 2.6\u00a0\u03bcm) at 350\u00a0\u03bcs/min using a gradient comprising mobile phase A and mobile phase B (acetonitrile:isopropanol, 50:50, v/v) as follows: The programme was initially set to 100% A, reached 92% A in 6\u00a0minutes and remained at 45% A from 6.5 to 10\u00a0minutes. The programme then switched to 100% B at 13\u00a0minutes and returned to 100% A from 14 to 14.5\u00a0minutes. MS analysis was performed on an AB Sciex 5500 QTrap hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer in negative\u2010ion mode. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Analyst software (AB SCIEX).    2.3  Cell culture  KGN cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS (penicillin/streptomycin) in 12\u2010well dishes at a density of 10 5 cells/well for 24\u00a0hours at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . For AA (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) and testosterone (ACROS ORGANICS, New Jersy, USA) stimulation, we added AA (100\u00a0ng/mL, 500\u00a0ng/mL and 1000\u00a0ng/ml according to the results in rat ovary) and testosterone (10\u00a0nmol/L, 50\u00a0nmol/L and 100\u00a0nmol/L) for 24\u00a0hours.    2.4  RNA isolation and qRT\u2010PCR  Total RNAs were isolated from ovarian tissues and KGN cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Then, isolated RNAs were reverse\u2010transcribed into cDNA using a Superscript III First\u2010Strand Synthesis System (TaKaRa, Japan). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in triplicate using a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). Gene expression primers used for the assays are indicated in Table S1 . Sample cDNA expression levels were normalized to that of the reference gene GAPDH with the formula 2 \u2212\u25b5\u25b5Ct .    2.5  Western blot analysis  Briefly, ovarian tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer with 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Proteins (50\u00a0\u03bcg) were separated on 10% SDS\u2010PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After being blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk for 2\u00a0hours at room temperature, the membranes were blotted with rabbit anti\u2010COX2 (2169, 1:1000 dilution; Epitomics), anti\u2010cPLA2 (2832, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, CST) or anti\u2010phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A2 (p\u2010cPLA2) (2831, 1:1000 dilution; CST) primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2\u00a0hours at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized via an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE, USA) and quantified with AlphaEaseFC (Alpha Innotech).    2.6  Immunohistochemical analysis  Briefly, 4\u2010\u00ecm\u2010thick frozen ovarian sections were prepared by conventional techniques. Primary anti\u2010COX2 (GB13077, 1:500 dilution; Guge Biotechnology, Wuhan, China) and anti\u2010cPLA2 (ab58375, 1:500 dilution; Abcam) antibodies were applied, and sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After rinsing in PBS for 15\u00a0minutes, the appropriate secondary antibody was applied, and sections were incubated for 45\u00a0minutes at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with avidin\u2010biotinylated peroxidase complexes in PBS for 30\u00a0minutes. Reactions were revealed using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the peroxidase substrate. Sections were rinsed in PBS after each immunostaining step. Finally, the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted in permanent mounting medium.    2.7  Steroid ELISA  The levels of oestrogen and progesterone in the spent media were measured using the Quantitative Diagnostic Kit (ELISA) (XITANG, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.    2.8  Statistical methods  All data were analysed with SPSS software (version 18.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL), and measurement data are presented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. Data with non\u2010normal distributions were analysed after logarithmic transformation. Intergroup comparisons were performed using one\u2010way analysis of variance. P values\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were considered statistically significant.     3  RESULTS   3.1  Endocrinological and metabolic characteristics of the study subjects  No significant changes in fasting blood glucose levels were observed in the 3 groups, while blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the other 2 groups 30\u00a0minutes after glucose stimulation ( P <\u00a0.05; Figure S1 B). As shown in Table S2 , significantly higher fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment\u2014insulin resistance (HOMA\u2010IR) levels were found in the PCOS group compared to those in the CON and HF groups ( P <  .05). Compared to that of the controls, HF and PCOS rats had elevated total serum FFA levels ( P <  .05), and the level of the inflammatory indicator TNF\u03b1 in the PCOS group was higher than that in the CON group ( P <  .05).    3.2  Alterations of PUFAs and their metabolites in PCOS rats  As shown in Figure 1 A, 5 kinds of PUFAs were detected and quantified in rat sera, LA (C18:2 n\u22126), AA (C20:4 n\u22126), \u03b1\u2010linolenic acid acid (ALA, C18:3 n\u22123), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n\u22123) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n\u22123). In addition to EPA, levels of the other 4 PUFAs were higher in the PCOS group than in the CON and HF groups, and these differences were statistically significant ( P <  .05). Changes in serum PUFA concentrations were not obvious between the CON and HF groups. Furthermore, only 3 kinds of PUFAs were detected in ovarian tissues, LA, AA and DHA, and their concentrations were lower than those in serum ( P <  .01). The ovarian levels of the 3 above\u2010mentioned PUFA types exhibited a descending tendency in the CON, HF and PCOS groups, respectively, and differences between the CON and PCOS groups were significant ( P <  .05). Moreover, the ovarian concentration of AA in the HF group was also significantly higher than that in the CON group (Figure 1 B).   Figure 1   Alterations of PUFA s and their metabolites in PCOS rats.

(C) Changes in AA metabolites by COX in the 3 groups. *Compared with the CON group, P <  .05; # Compared with the HF group, P <  .05. Serum PUFA levels are presented directly according to their concentrations. Because ovarian PUFA levels were measured in homogenized ovarian tissue, we adjusted the ovarian PUFA levels by total protein to make them comparable     As shown in Figure 1 C, compared with the CON group, the levels of AA metabolites, such as PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\u03b1, 8\u2010iso\u2010PGF2\u03b1, PGI2, PGJ2\u20102, TXB2 and 11d\u2010TXB2, via the COX pathway in ovarian tissues of the PCOS group were significantly increased ( P <  .05) except for 15\u2010deoxy\u2010\u039412,14\u2010PGJ2. The ovarian tissue levels of AA metabolites by the lipoxygenase (LOX) and P450 (cytochrome P450, P450) pathways were not obviously different among the 3 groups (Figure S2 ).    3.3  Expression of key enzymes in AA metabolism  As shown in Figure 2 A, the mRNA levels of all the PLA2 subtypes were higher in ovarian tissues of the PCOS group than in those of the CON and HF groups. More specifically, significantly higher expression of PLA2G4A was found in the PCOS group compared with that in the CON and HF groups ( P <  .05). The mRNA levels of PLA2G4A from KGN cells were also increased after the stimulation with testosterone (Figure 2 B). The gene expression levels of PLA2G2A and PLA2G5 in the PCOS group were also higher than those in the controls ( P <  .05). Second, the protein expression levels of cPLA2 in rat ovaries exhibited a gradually increasing trend in the CON, HF and PCOS groups, respectively, while the p\u2010cPLA2 protein expression levels and the p\u2010cPLA2/cPLA2 ratio (R\u2010cPLA2) gradually decreased. Both the p\u2010cPLA2 protein expression levels and R\u2010cPLA2 were significantly lower in the PCOS group than those in the CON group ( P <  .05; Figure 2 C). Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed results similar to those of Western blot (Figure 2 D).   Figure 2    cPLA 2 expression in rat ovarian tissue.

Testosterone (10\u00a0nmol/L, 50\u00a0nmol/L and 100\u00a0nmol/L) was added to the KGN cells for 24\u00a0h. *Compared with the CON group or DMSO group, P <  .05; # Compared with the HF group, P <  .05     COX1 and COX2 mRNA expression levels in ovarian tissues of the PCOS group were higher than those of the CON and HF groups ( P <  .05; Figure 3 A). Western blot indicated that COX2 protein expression levels in PCOS rat ovaries were significantly higher than those in the other 2 groups ( P <  .05) and were not different between the CON and HF groups (Figure 3 C). The mRNA levels of COX2 from KGN cells were higher after the stimulation with testosterone (Figure 3 B). As shown in Figure 3 D, darkened brown granules were located in mainly granulosa cells of antral follicles and corpus lutea. Several antral follicles were observed in ovarian tissues of the PCOS group, with staining of antral follicle darkening significantly, and no obvious changes in staining of the CON and HF groups were observed.

Testosterone (10\u00a0nmol/L, 50\u00a0nmol/L and 100\u00a0nmol/L) was added to the KGN cells for 24\u00a0h. *Compared with the CON group or DMSO group, P <  .05; # Compared with the HF group, P <  .05       3.4  Estradiol and progesterone levels after testosterone and AA stimulation  We then stimulated KGN cells with testosterone and/or AA. The estradiol level was increased after either testosterone or AA stimulation, as well as in combination group (Figure 4 A). Moreover, the progesterone level was increased after testosterone and/or AA stimulation (Figure 4 B).

AA (100\u00a0ng/ mL , 500\u00a0ng/ mL and 1000\u00a0ng/ mL ) and testosterone (10\u00a0nmol/L, 50\u00a0nmol/L and 100\u00a0nmol/L) were added to the KGN cells for 24\u00a0h. *Compared with the DMSO group, P <  .05        4  DISCUSSION  According to a previous study, 17 we established a PCOS rat model by treating rats fed a high\u2010fat diet with andronate, and they then showed ovarian and metabolic features of PCOS. We found higher serum AA levels but lower ovarian tissue AA levels in PCOS rats compared with those of CON and HF rats. In addition to 15\u2010deoxy\u2010\u039412,14\u2010PGJ2, levels of AA metabolites via the COX pathway were increased in PCOS rats. Further analysis of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon showed a correlation between decreased p\u2010cPLA2 expression and increased COX2 expression in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats, which might have led to alterations in the levels of AA and its metabolites (PGs).  Polycystic ovary syndrome rats exhibited higher levels of total FFAs in serum compared to those of the controls, which was consistent with results obtained from PCOS patients undergoing in\u00a0vitro fertilization. 4 We next quantified 4 kinds of PUFAs in circulation by lipidomics, and PCOS rats exhibited higher levels of all 4 types than control and HF rats. Nevertheless, only 3 kinds of PUFAs were detected in ovarian tissues by the same method, and descending trends in the concentrations of LA, AA and DHA were observed in the control, HF and PCOS rats, respectively, with variation in AA levels being the most significant. In our research, a series of PGs were also significantly elevated in PCOS rats, while differences in AA metabolites via the LOX and P450 pathways among the 3 groups were not observed.  N\u22126 fatty acids are widely recognized as pro\u2010inflammatory agents, 21 , 22 and AA (C20:4 n\u22126) has pronounced effects on gene expression, leading to changes in metabolism, cell growth and differentiation. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) selectively catalyses hydrolysis of the sn\u20102\u2010ester bond in membrane phospholipids, which can be stimulated by signals from a vast range of inflammatory markers, cytokines, growth factors and hormones and results in AA formation. The conversion of AA is further processed by downstream metabolic enzymes, such as COXs (COX1 and COX2), P450 and LOX, into eicosanoids, such as PGs and leukotrienes, which are terminal products that play roles in a variety of biological activities via their respective synthetases. 23 Hence, we focused on PLA2/AA/COX pathways, which are the most relevant to ovarian function.  Many forms of PLA2 have been identified to date, 24 but only 3 are capable of cleaving AA from membrane phospholipids: secretory PLA2 groups (PLA2G2A, PLA2G5) and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2, PLA2G4). 25 cPLA2 (PLA2G4) is specific for cleavage of AA from the second position of membrane phospholipids, whereas PLA2G2A and PLA2G5 hydrolyse any fatty acid at the second position. In our recent study, mRNA expression levels of PLA2G2A, PLA2G5 and PLA2G4A were higher in the ovaries of PCOS rats than in the controls, with a significant increase in PLA2G4A expression being observed in the HF group. The protein expression levels of cPLA were also elevated, as determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, but the p\u2010cPLA2 protein expression level and R\u2010cPLA2 were significantly decreased in the ovaries of PCOS rats compared to those of the controls. cPLA2 must be phosphorylated to cleave AA from membrane phospholipids, and elevated intracellular calcium levels stimulate cPLA2 activity independent of the phosphorylation status, 26 indicating the decreased production of AA via cPLA2 catalysis in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats.  Notably, PGs have important impacts on both the development of reproductive events and chronic inflammation, which are hallmarks of PCOS. The key regulatory step in PG biosynthesis is enzymic conversion of the fatty acid precursor by COX enzymes (COX1 and COX2). COX1 is constitutively expressed in theca cells but absent in granulosa cells, whereas COX2 is inducible by luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) only in granulosa cells. 27 COX2 expression levels in ovaries of PCOS rats were elevated at both the gene and protein level in our research, and a synchronous increase in the levels of several PGs was also observed. This result contrasts with those of others reporting that the COX2 expression level and PGE concentration were not altered, but PGF2\u03b1 levels were elevated in follicular fluid and granulosa cells in patients with PCOS after superovulation. 28 This difference might be related to differences in the study objects and interventions.  Amalfi et\u00a0al 29 reported that a higher dose of testosterone induced a pro\u2010inflammatory state in ovarian tissue mediated by increased levels of PGE and protein expression of COX2, the limiting enzyme of PG synthesis. Injection of chorionic gonadotropin into female rats enhanced the mRNA expression of COX2, leading to increased serum estradiol levels, and such effects were further amplified after hyperandrogenism. 30 Serum testosterone and LH concentrations were elevated in PCOS rats, 17 consistent with our current results. We also demonstrated that COX2 was expressed in rat granulosa cells, as rats fed a high\u2010fat diet that was exposed to hyperandrogenism exhibited increased ovarian COX expression in a manner consistent with a role of these enzymes in PG production. Because primate follicular fluid PG levels increase 100\u2010fold in response to ovulatory gonadotropin surges, 31 , 32 AA must be rapidly mobilized for periovulatory PG production. 33 PLA2G4A and COX2 mRNA expressions were also observed to be coinduced in the proresolving phase of the acute inflammatory process. 34 A cPLA2\u2010selective inhibitor decreased both PLA2 activity in monkey granulosa cell lysates and PGE2 accumulation in human granulosa\u2010lutein cell cultures. 35 However, no changes in mRNA abundance corresponding to COX2, similar PGE levels and diminished PGF2\u03b1 levels, were observed in PCOS follicles after hCG exposure. Considering the results obtained herein, decreased expression of the upstream bioactive p\u2010cPLA2 and increased activity of the downstream COX enzyme in ovarian tissues may have accounted for the decreased levels of AA found in the PCOS group.  Notably, some limitations of this study do exist. Due to the heterogeneity of PCOS, creating a single\u2010animal model that expresses all PCOS characteristics is difficult. 36 Second, although we have elucidated changes in key genes involved in alterations of AA and its metabolites in ovarian tissues of PCOS rats, additional studies are needed to explore the exact effects and mechanisms of AA and its metabolites underlying oocyte developmental competence during ovulation.  In conclusion, we demonstrated that ovarian levels of PUFAs in PCOS rats were decreased, with changes in AA being the most significant, although serum PUFA levels were increased accordingly. Correlation between decreased p\u2010cPLA2 activity and increased COX expression might result in lower AA concentrations in ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. However, the exact effects and mechanisms of AA and its metabolites underlying ovarian function remain unelucidated.
