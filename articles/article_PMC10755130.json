Either being born small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) is a risk factor for development of overweight and obesity later in life.  6  ,  7  The influence of PCOS on fetal growth is somewhat uncertain, with previous studies variously reported a higher risk of both SGA  3  ,  5  ,  8  ,  9  ,  10  ,  11  and LGA,  9  ,  10  and others reporting no influence on birthweight when adjusted for gestational age.  12    Metformin has been used to improve pregnancy outcomes for women with GDM, obesity and PCOS.  13  ,  14  Metformin freely passes through the placenta and therapeutic concentrations reach the fetus; however, metformin is not considered teratogenic.  15  ,  16  ,  17  Among women with obesity, metformin had no apparent effect on offspring birthweight and did not reduce the risk of being born LGA.  14  ,  18  Furthermore, our own analyses of a smaller cohort suggested that infants born to mothers with PCOS had a larger head circumference when exposed to metformin.  19  High maternal body mass index (BMI) appeared to modify the effect of metformin, resulting in larger head circumference, whereas among normal\u2010weight mothers, the effect of metformin compared with placebo was a reduced birth length.  19  In the current study we extend these analyses to include data from our three randomized controlled trials, the Pilot study, the PregMet study and the PregMet2 study, which investigated the effects of metformin in women with PCOS on pregnancy complications.  20  ,  21  ,  22  In these three studies, we have shown that, compared with placebo, metformin reduced late miscarriages and preterm birth but had no effect on the incidence of GDM or preeclampsia, despite reduced gestational weight gain.  22  ,  23    The aims of the current study were threefold: (1) estimate the effect of in utero metformin exposure on newborn anthropometrics compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials; (2)\u00a0investigate whether the effect of metformin on birth anthropometrics is modified by maternal pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, PCOS hyperandrogenic phenotype, serum androgen levels, preconception use of metformin and offspring sex; (3) assess birth anthropometrics in PCOS\u2010offspring by comparing this with a reference population.    2  MATERIAL AND METHODS  The current study is a post hoc analysis of individually pooled data from three double\u2010blinded, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized trials: The Pilot study, the PregMet study and the PregMet2 study (Figure 1 ).  20  ,  21  ,  22  In total, 801 women with PCOS were included in these studies which compared metformin\u2010treatment with placebo from the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria, age between 18 and 45\u2009years, and first trimester pregnancy with a single viable fetus.  24  PCOS phenotypes were categorized based on clinical history and review of patient files into the following groups: type A (hyperandrogenism [HA]\u2009+\u2009oligomenorrhea [OA]\u2009+\u2009polycystic ovaries [PCO]), type B (HA\u2009+\u2009OA), type C (HA\u2009+\u2009PCO) and type D (OA\u2009+\u2009PCO).  25  Hyperandrogenism was defined either clinically or biochemically. In the current analyses, PCOS androgen phenotypes were dichotomized as either hyperandrogenic (type A, B or C) or normo\u2010androgenic (type D). The participants received counseling on lifestyle and diet according to national guidelines. The studies have been described in more detail elsewhere.  20  ,  21  ,  22     FIGURE 1   Flowchart on inclusion, randomization and exclusions.      2.1  Endpoints  Main endpoints of the present study are birth anthropometrics measured at delivery, including head circumference, birth length, birthweight and their respective z \u2010scores. Secondary endpoints are placental weight and the offspring proportionality scores: BMI, ponderal index and birthweight:placental weight ratio. The z \u2010score calculations for birth anthropometrics are based on Niklasson's continuous growth reference, and are adjusted for sex and gestational age.  26      2.2  Serum measurements  The included women provided serum samples after an overnight fasting at five time points in pregnancy, approximately in gestational week 10, 19, 28, 32 and 36. The serum samples were drawn from the antecubital vein in non\u2010heparinized tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All samples were stored from 3 to 11\u2009years at \u221280\u00b0C after collection and analyzed for the androgens testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) with liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. Sex\u2010hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was determined by immunoassay on a Roche Cobas e602 System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). All hormones were analyzed at the Department of Biochemistry, Lillebelt Hospital, Denmark. Free testosterone index was calculated as (T/SHBG) \u00d7\u2009100.    2.3  Statistical analyses  Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA/MP16.1. The data were analyzed both according to the intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) principle and per\u2010protocol. The ITT analyses include all participants where it was possible to evaluate the main endpoints. Per\u2010protocol analyses comprise participants with acceptable adherence to study medication, defined as >70% tablet intake. The metformin effect was estimated using linear regression analyses, both with and without adjustment for maternal pre\u2010pregnancy BMI. The inclusion of pre\u2010pregnancy BMI as a covariate was decided a priori due to this being an important prognostic factor for birth anthropometrics and in order to improve statistical efficiency.  27  The estimated mean differences between the metformin and placebo groups are presented for each birth anthropometric together with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).    2.4  Subgroup analyses and treatment effect heterogeneity  Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the possible treatment effect heterogeneity due to maternal and infant characteristics: pre\u2010pregnancy BMI, PCOS phenotype, metformin\u2010use at conception, and offspring sex. For these analyses, maternal pre\u2010pregnancy BMI was divided into three categories from the World Health Organization (WHO) classification: Underweight/normal weight: BMI\u2009<25\u2009kg/m 2 , overweight: BMI 25\u201329\u2009kg/m 2  ; obese: BMI \u226530\u2009kg/m 2 .  28  Women were defined as having hyper\u2010 or normo\u2010androgenic PCOS phenotype as described above. Separate linear regression models were used to assess the effect of metformin within each subgroup and evidence for interaction between these subgroups and metformin. Interaction with pre\u2010pregnancy BMI was also assessed on a continuous scale.  Additionally, we assessed whether serum androgen levels were associated with the effect of metformin. We estimated the association between androgen levels and birth anthropometrics in the placebo group for each sample collection timepoint using linear regression, and the effect of metformin on androgen levels throughout pregnancy using mixed linear regression models. We then assessed the presence of an interaction between metformin and androgen levels on birth anthropometrics.    2.5  Ethics statement  All participants provided written informed consent before inclusion in the study.

After excluding dropouts ( n =\u200959) and non\u2010adherents ( n =\u200947), the per\u2010protocol analyses included 672 dyads (Figure 1 ). Baseline characteristics for women included in the metformin and placebo groups were similar apart from mean maternal BMI, which was 28.9\u2009kg/m 2 in the metformin and 27.9\u2009kg/m 2 in the placebo group (Table 1 , and Table S1 for the per\u2010protocol analyses).

Adjustment for maternal pre\u2010gestational BMI had little impact on the effect estimate (d\u2009=\u20090.40\u2009cm, 95% CI 0.16\u20130.64\u2009cm). Similarly, the head circumference z \u2010score was increased in the metformin compared with the placebo group (d\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI 0.11\u20130.40; adjusted: d\u2009=\u20090.23, 95% CI 0.08\u20130.38) (Table 2 ). Birth length, birthweight and placental weight did not differ significantly between the metformin and placebo groups, nor did the variables of proportionality, ie BMI, ponderal index and birthweight:placental weight ratio (Table 2 ). The per\u2010protocol analyses produced very similar findings (Table S2 ) and there was no clear difference between the proportion of infants born SGA and those born LGA (Table S3 ).

There was no clear effect of metformin on head circumference of infants born to women with a normal pre\u2010pregnancy weight. However, formal assessment of the interactive effect between metformin and maternal BMI was not statistically significant ( P =\u20090.075 and 0.135 for head circumference and head circumference z \u2010score, respectively). For both birth length and birthweight, the observed mean z \u2010score difference was higher in the metformin group when the mother was obese and lower if she had a normal pre\u2010pregnancy BMI (Figure 2 ). However, the estimated effect of metformin on birth length and birthweight within each BMI subgroup was inconclusive, and the interaction term was not statistically significant (Table S4 ). Also, when considering BMI as a continuous variable, we found no conclusive interactive effect between metformin and maternal BMI on z \u2010scores for head circumference, birth length or birthweight (Figure 3 ). The effect of metformin on placental weight and the proportionality scores did not substantially differ across the maternal BMI categories (Table S4 ).

FIGURE 3   Intention\u2010to\u2010treat analyses on anthropometric z \u2010scores of offspring born to women with PCOS, stratified according to maternal BMI.       3.4  Maternal phenotype, metformin exposure and birth anthropometrics  Offspring of women with PCOS hyperandrogenic phenotype were born with larger head circumference when exposed to metformin in utero compared with placebo also after adjusting for maternal BMI (head circumference z \u2010score: d\u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.48) (Figure 4 , Table S5 ). In contrast, the observed effect of metformin on head circumference at birth in normo\u2010androgenic mothers was negligible (head circumference z \u2010score: adjusted d =\u2009\u22120.04, 95% CI \u22120.34 to 0.27) and there was some indication that hyperandrogenic phenotype status may modify this effect ( P \u2010value for interaction: P =\u20090.061 and 0.047 in crude and adjusted analyses, respectively).   FIGURE 4   Intention\u2010to\u2010treat analyses on treatment effect of metformin on anthropometric z \u2010scores of offspring born to women with PCOS, stratified according to maternal androgen phenotype.

The estimated effect of metformin among hyperandrogen (mid\u2010blue) and normoandrogen (dark blue) is shown as a mean different in z \u2010score with 95% confidence interval. The pink line and shaded area represent the estimated metformin effect in the whole group without stratification. PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome.       3.5  Maternal androgen levels, metformin exposure and birth anthropometrics  Since the effect of metformin on head circumference appeared to be clearest in the PCOS hyperandrogenic phenotype, we further sought to determine whether higher serum androgen levels were also associated with a greater effect of metformin. Consistent with previous reports from women with PCOS, we found that levels of testosterone, androstenedione and SHBG gradually increase throughout pregnancy, and the average free testosterone index decreases (Table S6 ). We did not find evidence of a consistent association between any of the androgen levels throughout pregnancy and head circumference, birth length or birthweight within the placebo group (Table S7 ). When considering the effect of metformin on androgen levels, the metformin group was observed to have lower levels of testosterone and lower free testosterone index during the second and third trimesters (Figure S1 , Table S8 ). However, there was a high degree of variation between participants and insufficient evidence to conclude that this difference was due to metformin.  The possibility of an interactive effect between metformin and androgen levels was assessed for each birth anthropometric and each pregnancy timepoint. Although the P \u2010value for interaction indicated some evidence of interaction effect between metformin and specific androgens at specific timepoints on specific anthropometrics, there were no substantial or consistent interactive effects observed (Figure S2 for head circumference and Table S9 also for birth length and birthweight).    3.6  Subgroup analyses on offspring sex and metformin use at conception  Stratification by use of metformin at conception (Table S10 ) and infant sex (Table S11 ) did not suggest any statistically significant treatment effect heterogeneity.    3.7  Birth anthropometrics in the PCOS \u2010placebo group compared with growth reference  Compared with the growth reference, newborns of PCOS mothers in the placebo group were shorter (birth length z \u2010score: d = \u22120.4, 95% CI \u22120.5 to \u22120.3), yet had only a slightly lower birthweight and a similar head circumference (Table 2 ). In this placebo group, 11.3% (95% CI 8.5\u201314.8%) of the infants were born SGA and 7.4% (95% CI 5.2\u201310.5%) LGA (Table S3 ).     4  DISCUSSION  The main findings of this study are that newborns exposed to metformin during pregnancy had larger head circumference than those born to mothers with PCOS receiving placebo treatment, and that this effect was predominantly seen among overweight/obese women and those with hyperandrogenic phenotype. Further, we found that babies born to women with PCOS are shorter than the reference population.  The individually pooled data from all three trials give us an adequate sample size to make reasonably precise estimates of the effect of metformin on birth anthropometrics. As such, we have sufficient numbers to detect both the effect of metformin on head circumference and head circumference z \u2010score when given to women with PCOS during pregnancy, and to be fairly confident that metformin does not have a clinically significant effect on other anthropometric measures at birth. The finding that in utero exposure to metformin appears to result in a larger head circumference is consistent with our previous study based on the PregMet study alone, where the increase could be traced back to ultrasonographic measurements of biparietal diameter at gestational week 32.  19  Existing literature provides limited and diverging evidence as to whether metformin influences offspring head circumference. In line with our own findings, two trials performed by Garcia et al. showed that metformin treatment during pregnancy resulted in larger head circumference and higher weight of the brain at birth compared with controls in a porcine model of intrauterine growth restriction.  29  ,  30  Head circumference in children is strongly correlated with brain volume, and at a population level larger brain volume is associated both with better cognitive function and autism spectrum disorder.  31  ,  32  Head circumference at birth is also a reliable measure of brain weight and fetal brain growth, and within the normal range of head circumference, a Danish study showed that larger head circumference at birth was associated with a decreased risk of intellectual disability.  33  ,  34  Even so, it has also been shown that small differences in head circumference may not be associated with differences in IQ.  35  Despite such discrepancies in the evidence, we believe that the observed difference in head circumference seen in our study is interesting from a mechanistic and biological perspective. In a follow\u2010up study of children from the Pilot and PregMet studies ( n =\u200999) at age 6\u201315\u2009years, we found no difference in mean full\u2010scale IQ in those exposed to metformin (100.0 [SD 12.3]) and those exposed to placebo (100.9 [SD 10.1]). However, the sample size was small, and the confidence intervals wide, such that we cannot exclude the possibility that metformin may positively or negatively influence offspring IQ.  35  We intend to follow up the offspring of the PregMet2 regarding neurocognitive function.  The biologic mechanisms for our findings are not clear, and animal studies may suggest that metformin can mimic a catabolic state despite adequate nourishment in the fetus.  15  In a murine model, in utero metformin exposure resulted in a lower birthweight in offspring and a body composition similar to models of maternal malnourishment in pregnancy.  36  These findings may further substantiate the results in the studies by Garcia et al. that found larger offspring head circumference when using intrauterine growth restriction porcine models.  29  ,  30  These signs of apparent malnourishment could be explained by one of the mechanisms of metformin: a cascade reaction that activates adenosine monophosphate\u2010activated protein kinase which in turn inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes a \u201cstarving\u201d, catabolic state despite adequate nourishment.  37  Further, one might speculate that the reduced access to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) due to metformin mediates a form of \u201cbrain sparing effect\u201d  38  as a reaction to the experienced starvation\u2010like environment for the fetus,  37  which may be a possible explanation for the increased head circumference.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the interactive effect of metformin and maternal BMI on the head circumference of infants at birth. When evaluating the subgroups according to BMI categories and PCOS phenotype, the effect of metformin on head circumference was particularly apparent in overweight and obese mothers and those with hyperandrogenic phenotype. Conversely, metformin was observed to have minimal effect on head circumference in infants born to normal\u2010weight women and those with normo\u2010androgenic phenotype. However, there remains a degree of statistical uncertainty around the effect of metformin on head circumference in each of these subgroups such that the presence of an interactive effect between metformin and both pre\u2010pregnancy BMI and PCOS phenotype should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the normo\u2010androgenic phenotype group had few participants and we cannot exclude the possibility that metformin also has an effect on head circumference in these women. Infants of overweight/obese mothers have a risk of high birthweight and being large for gestational age.  39  A meta\u2010analysis investigated the effect of metformin in pregnant, obese, non\u2010diabetic women and found no effect of metformin on birthweight compared with placebo.  40  Metformin is widely used in pregnancy and is recommended as first line treatment along with insulin for gestational diabetes in several countries. It is of outmost importance to explore the metformin\u2010effect on offspring anthropometrics in GDM pregnancies, as PCOS and GDM overlap.  Although PCOS androgen phenotype may modify the effect of metformin, we did not see any clear evidence that maternal androgen levels during pregnancy influence the effect of metformin on head circumference, birth length or birthweight. Similarly, maternal androgen levels were not consistently associated with either birth anthropometrics or metformin use, which is consistent with the previously published results on a smaller group.  41  Evidence on how maternal androgens affect fetal anthropometry is scarce, especially concerning the impact on head circumference. A study by Huang et al. suggests that maternal androgens may influence the programming of intrauterine growth, by reporting associations between high maternal androgen levels and low offspring BMI z \u2010score at birth.  42  This is not easily interpreted using our findings, since head circumference was not an outcome in their study. Further investigations on maternal androgens and birth anthropometrics could be of clinical interest.  An interesting observation is that offspring born to mothers with PCOS are born shorter than the reference population, with slightly lower birthweight and similar head circumference. The average BMI for the PCOS mothers in this study was 28.4\u2009kg/m 2 , whereas it was 24\u2009kg/m 2 in the Niklasson's reference population. There is no indication that women in the PCOS group were shorter than the reference population, since maternal height was on average. Considering the known positive correlation between pre\u2010pregnancy BMI and offspring birthweight, one would expect higher birthweight z \u2010scores in the PCOS offspring than in the reference population,  43  also because around 25% of these mothers had GDM according to WHO 1999 criteria and 40% according to new WHO 2003 criteria. In contrast, we observed that infants born to PCOS mothers were shorter and nonsignificantly lighter, which may indicate that PCOS has a restrictive effect on both birthweight and birth length, with a greater negative impact on birth length, indirectly indicating fatter infants. A potential confounder is the possibility that the reference population also contains women with PCOS. If so, our results are at least not overestimated. Our findings are in accordance with former reports on similar or lower birthweight in PCOS offspring compared with controls.  3  ,  5  ,  8  ,  9  ,  10  ,  11    The strengths of this study in addition to its size and randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blinded design are the relative narrow confidence intervals for the effect of metformin on birth length, birthweight, placental weight and measures of proportionality, indicating that a clinically significant difference is unlikely. Additionally, the use of anthropometric z \u2010scores which are adjusted for both offspring sex and gestational age increases the accuracy of the effect estimates in this study. Baseline characteristics were comparable, except for weight and BMI. To account for this limitation, we analyzed the data with adjustment for BMI. Another possible limitation is the predominance of white women among the participants; the results may not be directly applicable to all ethnicities. An additional limitation of the current study is that it is a post hoc analysis which includes multiple statistical comparisons. Since this is an exploratory analysis of correlated birth anthropometric measures, we opted not undertake adjustment for multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, for the same reasons, we have interpreted the result cautiously and focused on findings which are consistent. Particularly the subgroup results should be interpreted with caution and need to be repeated in future studies.    5  CONCLUSION  Infants born to women with PCOS had a larger average head circumference after in utero exposure to metformin compared with placebo. The effect of metformin on head circumference was most pronounced among offspring of overweight and obese mothers, and mothers with hyperandrogenic phenotype. Further studies are needed to confirm whether maternal pre\u2010pregnancy BMI or hyperandrogenism truly modify the effect of metformin on head circumference. We also found that, compared with the reference population, infants born to PCOS mothers in the placebo group were shorter at birth, with slightly lower birthweight but similar head circumference.
