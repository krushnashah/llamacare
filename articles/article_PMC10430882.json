Two researchers independently screened articles, collected data and evaluated the quality, with Review manager 5.3 for meta-analysis. Totally 20 randomized controlled studies with 1961 subjects were included. Meta analysis showed that pregnancy rate [RR=1.44 (1.28, 1.62), p<0.00,001], ovulation rate [RR=1.42 (1.14, 1.78), p=0.002] and matured oocytes rate [RR=1.08 (1.03, 1.13), p=0.002] of vitamin D supplementation group were significantly higher than those of control group. Meanwhile, early miscarriage rate [RR=0.44 (0.30, 0.66), p<0.00,001], androgen level [MD=-2.31 (-3.51, -1.11), p=0.0002], luteinizing hormone [MD=-1.47 (-2.57, -0.36), p=0.009], follicle stimulating hormone [MD=-0.15 (-0.24, -0.05), p=0.002], and premature delivery rate [RR=0.38, 95% CI (0.21, 0.70), p=0.002] were declined significantly than the controls. However, only one article suggested that the progesterone [MD=6.52 (4.52, 8.52), p<0.05] in the vitamin D intervention group was increased. There was no notable difference in the biochemical pregnancy rate [RR=0.95 (0.55, 1.63), p=0.84], gestational hypertension rate [RR=0.40, 95% CI (0.15, 1.11), p=0.08], gestational diabetes mellitus rate [RR=0.27, 95% CI (0.05, 1.39), p=0.11], fertilization rate [RR=1.05 (1.00, 1.10), p=0.04], cleavage rate [RR=1.03 (0.99, 1.06), p=0.17], high-quality embryo rate [RR=1.08 (0.98, 1.20), p=0.10], endometrial thickness [MD=0.10], 77 (-0.23, 1.77), p=0.13], estrogen level [MD=-0.34 (-1.55, 0.87), p=0.59], LH/FSH [MD=-0.14, 95% CI (-0.48, 0.20), p=1.00] and anti-Mullerian hormone [MD=-0.22 (-0.65, 0.21), p=0.32]. Vitamin D supplementation contribute to the higher pregnancy and ovulation rates, and lower androgen, LH, FSH and early miscarriage rates in women with PCOS, regardless of the use of ovulation induction drugs or assisted reproductive technologies. However, no significant improvement was observed in fertilization rate or cleavage rate. Due to the limitation in quality of involved studies, more high-quality RCTs are needed for further validation.",
    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of childbearing period, and 75% of these patients suffer from infertility ( 1 ). Existing treatments of infertility in PCOS mainly include monitoring ovulation, ovulation induction, ovarian perforation and assisted reproduction technologies ( 2 ). In addition, the supplementation of some nutrients has received some attention as an adjunction, such as vitamins, unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, etc. ( 3 ). Notably, about 67 \u2013 85% of PCOS patients have concomitant vitamin D deficiency ( 4 ). What\u2019s more, vitamin D deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in PCOS ( 5 ). These days, vitamin D supplementation draw some attentions in the preparation for pregnancy in PCOS patients, and the possible mechanism relies on its protection against oxidative stress and keep calcium ion levels to maintain the cell\u2019s resting potential, which in turn benefits fertilization, cleavage, implantation, and placental formation ( 6 ).  However, current conclusions regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy rates are inconsistent. Some studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation was able to increase pregnancy rates in PCOS patients, while others have proved that vitamin D supplementation had no significant improvement ( 7 ). Based on this argument, the present study systematically collated the existing evidence of vitamin D adjuvant treatment for infertility in PCOS patients, with the view of seeking evidence for whether vitamin D improves the pregnancy situation of PCOS patients and providing a basis for clinical medication.    2  Methods   2.1  Eligibility criteria, study selection and data extraction  This article followed the agreement registered in the International Prospective Systems Review Register (No. CRD42021250284).   2.1.1  Criteria included   2.1.1.1  Study type  Randomized controlled study.    2.1.1.2  Subjects  Patients with PCOS who had fertility requirements. The diagnostic criteria of PCOS follows the Rotterdam criteria in 2003, that at least two of the following three criteria were met:   2.1.1.2.1  Ovulatory dysfunction (oligoovulation/anovulation);   2.1.1.2.1.1  Hyperandrogenism serum testosterone level \u2265 2.5 nmol/l or clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism: modified Ferriman Gallwey score \u2265 8, Acne or alopecia);    2.1.1.2.1.2  Polycystic ovary like changes (defined as \u2265 12 follicles (2 \u2013 9 mm)) in one or two ovaries and/or ovarian volume>10 cm 3 under ultrasound. Other causes of hyperandrogenism ( 8 ) (such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, androgen secreting tumors, etc.) or ovulation disorders (for example: functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, premature ovarian insufficiency, etc.) were excluded.      2.1.1.3  Interventions  Placebo, metformin, short acting contraceptives, ovulation induction drugs and assisted reproductive technology were defined as control group. Vitamin D supplemented based on control group (dosage form, time and dosage are not limited) were considered as the intervention group.    2.1.1.4  Outcome indicators  Main outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate and ovulation rate, and secondary outcomes were related outcomes like cumulative pregnancy rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, pregnancy complications, term delivery rate, premature delivery rate, matured oocytes rate, sex hormone level and adverse events. It was suggested that the ovulation manifestations include progesterone level \u2265 19 nmol/l,or after the dominant follicle (\u2265 1.2mm) under ultrasound, the dominant follicle disappeared, collapsed or shrank by \u2265 50%, and a small amount of fluid accumulated in the rectal fossa. If the basal body temperature rose for 3 days and no ovulation was observed by ultrasonography, luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) would be diagnosed. The follow-up duration was 6 months.     2.1.2  Excluding criteria  Conference summary, animal experiment, cohort study, retrospective study and non- randomized controlled intervention study were excluded.    2.1.3  Data extraction  Two researchers (Yang Meina, Peng Jin) independently evaluated the articles and collected information. Inconsistencies were judged through discussion with the third author (Zhang Jing). The two researchers independently collected the following data: basic characteristics (author, year, country); Characteristics of subjects (age, number of people in each group) Outcome indicators (pregnancy related indicators: pregnancy rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, early miscarriage rate, incidence of pregnancy complications, assisted reproduction related indicators: fertilization rate, cleavage rate, high-quality embryo rate, fetal premature delivery rate, ovulation related indicators: ovulation rate, matured oocytes rate, endometrial thickness, sex hormone level and adverse events). We sent emails to study authors for more information.     2.2  Search strategy  We searched Pubmed, MEDLINE(via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), EMBASE (via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via Ovid), Web of Science, CNKI, WangFang and the Vip database from inception until April 2021. We applied \u201cvitamin d\u201d \u201cvitamin d1\u201d \u201cvitamin d2\u201d \u201cvitamin d3\u201d \u201c1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D\u201d \u201ccholecalciferol\u201d \u201cPolycystic Ovary Syndrome\u201d \u201cRandomized Controlled Trial\u201d as search terms. The search strategy is available in  Supplementary Information  .    2.3  Data synthesis and analysis  Data analyses were conducted with the software Review Manager 5.3. For dichotomous data (ovulation and pregnancy rate for example), we used relative risk (RR). When it comes to continuous data (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and so on), mean difference (MD) was applied. When different scales were taken for the same, we performed standardized mean difference (SMD) instead. MD, if not mentioned, was calculated from the standard error, interquartile range or 95% confidence interval. If there were at least 5 studies, we synthesized the data. Cochrane risk of bias tool was implemented to access the quality of the evidence. We applied I\u00b2 test to examine the heterogeneity. The fixed-effects model was applied when I\u00b2 <50%, otherwise the random-effects model was conducted. Sensitivity analysis was utilized to distinguish the source of heterogeneity in Stata 12.0. We extracted data from images with Engauge Digitizer 4.1 if necessary. Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s test were performed to access the public bias.     3  Results   3.1  Studies selection and the flow chart  A total of 557 articles were retrieved, including 555 from the database and 2 from the references. After screening by EndnoteX8, 388 articles were left after removing duplicate articles (n=169).39 articles were left after removing conference abstract (n=17), animal experiment (n=10), and irrelevant articles (n=86) after browsing the title. We read the abstracts and carefully screened out non RCT studies (n=17) and no full text studies (n=2). A total of 20 articles were included:8 in English and 12 in Chinese (  Figure\u00a01  ).   Figure\u00a01   Flowchart of study selection.       3.2  Characteristics of included studies    Table\u00a01  presents the basic characteristics of the 20 RCTs including 1961 subjects. The average age of control group was 28.83 \u00b1 4.35 years old, and it was 28.61 \u00b1 4.56 years of age in the vitamin D intervention group. There was no statistical difference in the age of the subjects in studies. The baseline level of vitamin D in the control group was 15.40 \u00b1 6.50 on average, and that in the intervention group was 14.22 \u00b1 4.86. Both groups were in a state of vitamin D deficiency, which were comparable. Only two studies mentioned whether the subjects were secondary infertility, which was balanced and comparable between groups. The other articles did not mention the number of previous pregnancies. All included studies did not mention whether subjects experienced any pregnancy complication in the past. The follow-up time was from 2 weeks to 3 months. Two of the studies reported the delivery situation and subjects with fetal heart rate under ultrasound 5 weeks after embryo implantation and followed up until delivery. The intervention of vitamin D were intramuscular injection or long-term oral administration. The average daily dose varies from 200 IU to 10000 IU, and the intervention duration varies from a single dose, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. In terms of outcome indicators, 18 studies reported pregnancy rate, 9 included ovulation rate, and 7 investigated matured oocytes rate (  Table\u00a01  ).

We divided patients into 2 subgroups based on whether they had infertility or not. As a result, a total of 13 studies involved patients with infertility, and the vitamin D intervention group had an increased pregnancy rate when compared with the control group [RR = 1.88, 95% CI (1.48, 2.38), P < 0.00001, I\u00b2= 7%]. While those studies without mention infertility in PCOS patients showed the same trend [RR = 1.89, 95% CI (1.24, 2.87), P = 0.003, I\u00b2 = 16%].  According to Method for vitamin D deficiency screening published by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China in June 2020, serum vitamin D content \u2265 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) was considered as the normal level whileunders12 ng/ml (30 nmol/L) was defined as vitamin D deficiency status, and between as vitamin D insufficiency status. Only 1 study reported PCOS patients with normal vitamin D at baseline, and there was no significant difference of the pregnancy rate between the vitamin D intervention group and the control group [RR = 1.22, 95% CI (0.59, 2.51), P = 0.59]. Patients in ten studies were in vitamin D insufficiency condition at baseline, and pregnancy rates improved significantly in PCOS patients compared with controls after vitamin D intervention [RR = 1.57, 95% CI (1.29, 1.90), P < 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 21%]. Whereas 7 studies did not report baseline of vitamin D levels, the pregnancy rate improved in the intervention group compared with the control group [RR = 1.36, 95% CI (1.16, 1.58), P = 0.0001, I\u00b2 = 0%].  We applied subgroup analysis according to subjects with or without hyperandrogenism at baseline, the result revealed pregnancy rates consistency in patients with [RR = 1.52, 95% CI (1.16, 1.98), P = 0.002, I\u00b2 = 0%] or without [RR = 1.39, 95% CI (1.14, 1.69), P = 0.0009, I\u00b2 = 0%] hyperandrogenism.  Subgroup analysis performed by whether daily dose above 2000IUor not. Results showed no difference about pregnancy rates between the lower daily dose (<2000IU/d) [RR=1.43, 95%CI (1.22, 1.68),p<0.00001, I\u00b2=0%] and the higher daily dose(>2000IU/d) [RR=1.43, 95%CI (1.19, 1.71),p=0.0001, I\u00b2=22%].  Subgroup analysis according to the period of treatment unveiled that 8 weeks [RR = 1.42, 95% CI (1.17, 1.74), P = 0.0004, I\u00b2 = 44%] or 12 weeks [RR = 1.49, 95% CI (1.24, 1.81), P < 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 0%] of vitamin D supplementation both improved pregnancy rates. However, either single dose [RR = 1.47, 95% CI (0.98, 2.22), p = 0.06, I\u00b2 = 47%] or more than 12 weeks [RR = 1.30, 95% CI (0.96, 1.77), p=0.09, I\u00b2=0%] did not ameliorate the pregnancy rate. On the other aspect, both continuous daily administration [RR = 1.36, 95% CI (1.18, 1.56), P < 0.0001, I\u00b2 = 0%] and intermittent administration [RR = 1.62, 95% CI (1.30, 2.02), P < 0.0001, I\u00b2 = 45%] of vitamin D elevated pregnancy rates in PCOS.  Vitamin D supplementation alone [RR = 1.44, 95% CI (1.27, 1.62), P < 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 3%] did rise the pregnancy rate. However, it was not significantly changed by concomitant calcium supplementation [RR = 1.50, 95% CI (0.58, 3.90), P = 0.41, I\u00b2 = 0%], probably due to the small number of relative studies.    3.3.1.2  Cumulative pregnancy rates  Cumulative pregnancy rate equals the number of pregnancies (per patient, clinical pregnancy, or after transfer of all embryos from one oocyte retrieval cycle)/number of all oocyte retrieval cycles \u00d7 100% ( 26 ). Only one study reported the cumulative pregnancy rate ( 19 ). After the first cycle of induced ovulation, both groups had the same cumulative pregnancy rate (0%). Cumulative pregnancy rates were 13% and 12% in the vitamin D intervention and control groups after the second cycle, respectively. After the third cycle, it was 29% in the intervention group and 24% in the control group. We drew data and discovered no statistical difference between both groups for the three cycles, specifically for the first cycle [RR = 0.99, 95% CI (0.89, 1.09)], the second cycle [RR = 0.96, 95% CI (0.83, 1.09)], and the third cycle [RR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.71, 1.07)] (  Table\u00a02  ).     3.3.2  Ovulation related outcomes   3.3.2.1  Ovulation rate  Ovulation rate was displayed in 9 studies, including 387 subjects in the vitamin D group and 377 in the control group. Random effects model showed that ovulation rate was apparently improved with vitamin D supplementation [RR=1.42, 95%CI (1.14, 1.78), p=0.002, I\u00b2=59%] (  Table\u00a02  ;  Figure\u00a05  ).   Figure\u00a05   Forest plot of the ovulation rate.       3.3.2.2  Sex hormone related outcomes   3.3.2.2.1  Luteinizing hormone  A total of 8 studies revealed luteinizing hormone levels, including 345 subjects in the intervention group and 340 in the control group. The random effects model showed that LH levels were significantly lower in individuals of the vitamin D supplemented group[MD= -1.47, 95%CI (-2.57, -0.36), p=0.009, I\u00b2=93%]. We carried out the sensitivity analysis for obvious heterogeneity. After removing the result in ( 13 ), I\u00b2 decreased to 0%, while LH was still lower in the intervention group [MD= -1.31, 95%CI (-1.60, -1.01), p<0.00001, I\u00b2=0%] (  Table\u00a02  ).    3.3.2.2.2  Follicle-stimulating hormone  Follicle stimulating hormone levels were mentioned in 7 studies, involving 284 in the intervention group and 280 in the control group. A fixed effects model resulted that FSH levels were noticeable lower in the vitamin D supplemented group [MD=-0.15, 95%CI (-0.24, -0.05), p=0.002, I\u00b2=0%] (  Table\u00a02  ).    3.3.2.2.3  LH/FSH  Seven studies showed both LH and FSH levels, consisted of 284 patients in the vitamin D supplementation group and 279 patients in the control group. LH/FSH was calculated and the fixed effects model found that LH/FSH was not significantly different between two groups [MD=-0.14, 95%CI (-0.48, 0.20), p=1.00, I\u00b2=0%] (  Table\u00a02  ).    3.3.2.2.4  Anti-mullerian hormone  There were 4 studies reported anti-mullerian hormone, including 155 participants in the intervention group and 150 in the control group. The random effects model showed that AMH levels were not significantly changed in the vitamin D supplemented group compared with the control group [MD=-0.22, 95%CI (-0.65, 0.21), p=0.32, I\u00b2=68%] (  Table\u00a02  ).    3.3.2.2.5  Testosterone  Testosterone levels were reported in 7 studies. A random effect model displayed a significant decrease in the vitamin D supplementation group compared with the control group [MD=-2.31, 95%CI(-3.51, -1.11), p=0.0002, I\u00b2=97%]. Heterogeneity remained large after subgroup analyses according to the test period: with basal testosterone levels under a random effects model [MD=-1.48, 95%CI (-2.94, -0.01), p=0.05, I\u00b2=95%] and the test period not mentioned [MD=-3.40, 95%CI (-5.99, -0.80), p=0.01, I\u00b2=98%], respectively (  Table\u00a02  ).    3.3.2.2.6  Estradiol  Estradiol levels were assessed in 5 literatures, involving 251 patients supplemented with vitamin D and 250 patients in the control group. Random effects model resulted that estradiol levels were not significantly different in two groups [MD=-0.34,95%CI (-1.55, 0.87), p=0.59, I\u00b2=97%]. Subgroups analysis according to the examining period demonstrated the same trend under random effects model meta-analysis. There was no noticeable difference between the two groups about basal estradiol levels [MD=0.32, 95%CI (-0.07, 0.71), p=0.11, I\u00b2=66%] and estradiol levels that the test time not mentioned [MD=-1.34, 95%CI (-5.49, 2.81), p=0.53, I\u00b2=99%] (  Table\u00a02  ).  In summary, we predominantly found vitamin D supplementation could ameliorate outcomes like the premature delivery rate and the matured oocytes rate. While other indicators did not alter significantly (the early miscarriage rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, the fertilization rate, the incidence of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the cleavage rate, the high quality embryo rate and endometrial thickness) (  Supplementary Information  ).      3.3.3  Adverse events  Only 4 studies reported the adverse events. One trail showed no obvious adverse reactions in both intervention and control groups. Two of them demonstrated ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurred in both groups during ovulation induction, but there was no significant difference between the vitamin D intervention group and the control group. One research revealed that the control group had allergic reactions to short-acting oral contraceptives.  In general, no trail had severe adverse event for vitamin D per se.     3.4  Bias  We exerted funnel plots, Begg\u2019s tests and Egger\u2019s tests. No public bias was found in our research (  Figures\u00a06  ,  7  ).   Figure\u00a06   Begg\u2019s test.

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy in PCOS patients. A total of 20 RCTs were included. There were 1961 subjects in total, no statistical difference was discovered between the intervention group and the control group in terms of age and vitamin D level at baseline. This systematic review, based on the existing RCTs, provides evidence for PCOS patients to take vitamin D supplements or not before pregnancy.  The results of meta-analysis found that the pregnancy rate, ovulation rate and matured oocytes rate of vitamin D supplementation group were significantly higher than those of the control group. The premature delivery rate, testosterone, LH and FSH decreased evidently. Only one trial suggested that the level of progesterone in vitamin D supplementation group increased. There was no remarkable difference with vitamin D supplemented in chemical purity rate, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, high-quality embryo rate, endometrial thickness, serum estradiol and AMH.   4.1  Pregnancy related outcomes  In this study, the pregnancy rate of PCOS patients was apparently increased with vitamin D supplementation, but vitamin D had no significant impact on other indicators related to assisted reproductive technology, such as fertilization rate, cleavage rate and high-quality embryo rate. To best of our knowledge, there is no systematic review on the gestation of PCOS patients with vitamin D supplementation. Existing results are dominantly on the correlation between vitamin D levels and pregnancy rate in IVF, and the conclusions are not consistent. Specifically, vitamin D levels in serum and follicular fluid may improve, reduce or have no effect on pregnancy rate ( 5 ), and the reason for the inconsistency may be the difference of vitamin D levels in patients themselves. The mechanism of how vitamin D improve the pregnancy rate of PCOS patients is not clearly demonstrated. In combination with other results of this study, we speculated that supplementation of vitamin D may improve the pregnancy rate of PCOS patients by mitigating inflammation in granulosa cells, ameliorating ovulation and increasing endometrial thickness.  This study also indicated that the incidence of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDB) in the vitamin D supplementation group was not significantly different from that in the control group, but the premature delivery rate was reduced. However, only three articles included in this study mentioned pregnancy complications. Thus the results should be treated with caution. The existing meta-analysis found that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia, but no difference was found about the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus ( 27 ). The different findings between this study and the previous study may because of populations (PCOS or healthy gravidas), timing of vitamin D supplementation (before or during maternity) and doses they used. Some researchers have pointed out that vitamin D plays a role in reducing blood pressure and glucose level. A meta-analysis found that the diastolic blood pressure of adolescents decreased after vitamin D supplement ( 28 ). The potential mechanism is that vitamin D reduces the production of endothelium-derived contractile factor and ultimately decreases blood pressure by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) ( 29 ). In addition, vitamin D deficiency is positively related to the risk of GBD ( 30 ). The underlying mechanism of vitamin D\u2019s improvement on glucose metabolism is (1) to stimulate the expression of insulin receptor, thus increasing the insulin sensitivity of liver, muscle and adipose tissue (2) to stimulate the nuclear vitamin D receptor, thus raising the production of GLUT-4 (3) to promote calcium-dependent insulin secretion (4) to inhibit the production of cytokines from macrophages, and protect islet cells from damage.  Moreover, we found that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the incidence of premature delivery in PCOS offspring in present study. However, it is noteworthy that only two studies have reported on this outcome and were completed by the same researcher, which may cause bias. At present, there is no other research reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the occurrence of premature delivery of the fetus in PCOS women, but a meta-analysis found that the risk of premature delivery of pregnant women with vitamin D deficiency is increased ( 31 ). Although more studies are still needed to verify, there are some possible grounds for the reduction of premature delivery rate of fetus by vitamin D supplementation for gravidas. Research demonstrates that vitamin D deficiency of pregnant women is positively correlated with the increased risk of premature delivery ( 32 , 33 ), and vitamin D may reduce the incidence of premature delivery via NF- \u03ba B, which plays an anti-inflammatory role and reduces infections ( 34 ).    4.2  Ovulation rate  We found that vitamin D supplementation improved ovulation rate in PCOS patients. Berry et\u00a0al. claims that 70% infertile PCOS women have a lower level of vitamin D than the healthy ( 35 ). Besides, studies unveil that vitamin D deficiency is positively associated with the number of mature oocytes ( 36 ) and the ovulation rates ( 35 , 37 , 38 ). Nevertheless, different concepts still exist. Evidence states serum vitamin D in PCOS women are similar to controls ( 39 ). The discrepancy may originate from diverse races and the specific type of PCOS. Except for vitamin D receptor and sex hormone related mechanism that will be mentioned later, the mechanism of VD affecting ovulation is that VD may down regulate AMH receptor II, thus promote the activation and maturation of oocytes ( 40 ).    4.3  Sex hormone related outcomes  In addition to the above gestation related indicators, the effect of vitamin D on the level of sex hormones in patients with PCOS also deserves attention. In this study, compared with the control group, testosterone, LH and FSH in vitamin D supplementation group decreased significantly, while progesterone level increased, but estradiol, AMH and endometrial thickness did not change.  We found that the serum testosterone level decreased in vitamin D intervention group. Studies manifests that in women with PCOS, the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) is negatively correlated with testosterone ( 29 ). A meta-analysis involving 183 PCOS patients suggests serum testosterone decreases after vitamin D supplementation ( 41 ), which complies with this study. Similarly, Nahla et\u00a0al. demonstrates 50,000 IU per week of VD can decrease testosterone in overweight PCOS women ( 42 ). The mechanisms related to vitamin D and testosterone are not obvious. Possible mechanisms might be the improvement of insulin resistance, thus interrupting the vicious cycle of insulin resistance-hyperandrogenism. The increase of aromatase activity promote the conversion of androgen to estrogen, which is described later. In addition, the etiology of PCOS is linked to the effect of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism on LH, SHBG concentration, testosterone level, insulin resistance and serum insulin level ( 41 ). In terms of the molecular mechanism, vitamin D deficiency increases the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian tissue, thus interfering with the selection of dominant follicles. What\u2019s more, hyperandrogenism lead to increasing AR activity. Decreased ARA70 (androgen receptor-associated protein 70, which is necessary for androgen receptor (AR) and VDR transcription activity) subsequently inactivates free testosterone by promoting the transcription of VDR/RXR (retinoid X receptor) complex, which induces a vicious cycle of hyperandrogenism. Vitamin D supplementation breaks this cycle by up-regulating VDR ( 43 ).  There was no remarkable difference in estrogen level and endometrium in two groups. According to previous studies, calcitriol (1,25 (OH) 2 vitamin D) directly led to the production of estrogen and progesterone in cultured human ovary and placenta cells, which may enhance the luteinization of granulosa cells and ameliorate endometrial environment ( 33 ). The reason for the discrepancy could be there are few studies on the relationship about vitamin D and sex hormones, and more studies are still required. In addition, the difference in the basic treatment and monitoring days of each trail trial were included in this study, after further analyzing, the heterogeneity eliminated and the endometrial thickness of vitamin D supplementation group was increased compared with the control group. Only one study suggested that progesterone increased after vitamin D use, which was consistent with previous reports. Besides, the increase of progesterone may reduce the abortion rate.  There was no difference in the level of AMH between the vitamin D intervention group and the control group in present study. Some studies show that serum vitamin D is positively correlated with AMH, while in VD-deficient women with PCOS, VD supplementation improves the abnormally elevated AMH ( 44 , 45 ). There is discrepancy in our study and previous studies. The reason may be that patients\u2019 conditions possess their own characteristics, and the population analyzed in previous studies has no fertility requirements. Besides, age may be one reason for inconsistency.  In present study, the LH and FSH in the vitamin D intervention group were notably lower than those in the control group in PCOS patients. For extraordinary heterogeneity of LH, we executed sensitivity analysis. After removing Liu shengxian\u2019s study, the heterogeneity decreased to 0%. The heterogeneousness may come from the elementary treatment whether use short-acting contraceptives and ovulation induction drugs or other medicine that affect sex hormones. It indicates that vitamin D supplementation may reduce LH level based on using short-acting contraceptives or ovulation induction drugs. Departed studies indicate that serum vitamin D level is negatively correlated with serum LH and FSH, but no statistical difference ( 46 ). While other findings demonstrate that LH and FSH levels are not related to vitamin D level ( 47 ), that may be due to most of the previous studies are women of healthy childbearing age, while our study focus on PCOS patients. The possible mechanism involved in vitamin D ameliorating LH of PCOS is that vitamin D attenuates the adverse effects of AGEs on human granulosa cell (GCs) steroids by down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cell membrane receptor for AGEs (RAGE) ( 48 ). In addition, in human cumulus granulosa cells, vitamin D increases aromatase activity ( 49 ), while the expression of AMH receptor and FSH receptor decrease, thus promoting androgen converts to estrogen. Besides, vitamin D offsets the inhibition of AMH on GC differentiation and allows follicles to maturate and ovulate ( 49 ).  Though our study is the first systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of vitamin D on pregnancy in PCOS patients, some limitations should be treated carefully. Firstly, the quality of included studies could be higher. Second, the data of some indicators such as the cumulative pregnancy rate was not published, which induces the analysis limited.     5  Conclusion  In conclusion, the current evidence demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation may improve the ovulation and pregnancy rate of PCOS patients on the basis of routine treatment, providing a certain basis for clinical use of vitamin D in PCOS patients in the future. However, due to the quality and heterogeneity of the included studies, more valuable studies are still needed.
