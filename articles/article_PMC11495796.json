    "body": "1. Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common gynecological endocrine disease that affects approximately 6% to 20% of women of reproductive age. [ 1 , 2 ] And PCOS is not only related to fertility, but also a metabolic disease that reduces women\u2019s quality of life. [ 3 ] The main manifestations were irregular menstrual cycle, low or anovulation, hyperandrogenemia, and polycystic ovary changes. Studies have shown that PCOS is frequently related with metabolic disorders such as infertility, [ 4 ] cardiovascular disease, [ 5 , 6 ] insulin resistance, [ 7 , 8 ] type 2 diabetes, [ 9 ] dyslipidemia, [ 10 ] visceral obesity, [ 11 ] vascular endothelial dysfunction, [ 12 ] and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. [ 13 ] At present, the pathogenesis of PCOS is not clear, and it is generally believed that genetic factors and environmental factors are the result of the combined effect. [ 14 , 15 ] The treatment is mainly based on lifestyle intervention, and symptomatic drug treatment is auxiliary. Weight management, insulin allergy agents, and androgen lowering agents are used primarily through medical or surgical interventions, and there is still a lack of effective drugs. [ 12 ]  Some PCOS-related genes, such as FshBTA, have been linked to carbohydrate metabolism and steroid production pathways, demonstrating a significant correlation between metabolic factors and the pathological incidence of PCOS. [ 16 ] Numerous studies have found that gut flora disorders are intimately linked to the incidence and progression of metabolic illnesses. [ 17 ] Intestinal flora disorders may transmit signals to the brain center through the nervous and humoral system by changing the production of small molecules such as short-chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides, and eventually lead to abnormal secretion of gonadotrophins and sex hormones. [ 18 ] This leads to metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the disturbance of intestinal flora may be connected with the brain center through the gut\u2013brain axis, affect the metabolism and sex hormone levels in the body, and thus participate in the pathogenesis of PCOS. [ 19 , 20 ] Many studies have revealed alterations in the makeup of the gut microbiota in PCOS animal models and people, leading in flora dysregulation. [ 21 ] The gut microbial community of PCOS patients was significantly different from healthy people, with the intestinal bacteroides significantly increased, while the serum and fecal levels of glycydeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid significantly decreased. [ 21 ] However, the association between gut microbiota and PCOS remains unknown. Furthermore, the potential pathway between gut microbiota and PCOS is unknown.  Mendelian randomization (MR) is a strategy for determining the causal association between risk factors and diseases by using genetic variation as an instrumental variable (IV), [ 22 ] which can avoid the interference of reverse causality and confounding factors in observational studies. [ 23 ] By integrating the genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of intestinal flora and PCOS in a publicly available database, the network MR Method was used to analyze the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PCOS, and to explore potential pathways.    2. Methods   2.1. Study design  The overall study design is illustrated in Figure 1 . Details of the analysis procedure are provided below: (1) selection of genetic variants that were proxies of the effect of gut microbiota: gut microbiota \u2192 PCOS. (2) Selection of risk factors on the PCOS pathways as potential mediators: risk factors \u2192 PCOS. (3) Network MR analysis estimating the causal effects of gut microbiota and risk factors on PCOS, and estimation of the mediation effect of risk factors linking gut microbiota with PCOS, with integration of causal evidence with biological pathway information: gut microbiota \u2192 risk factors \u2192 PCOS. And (4) expanded the exploration of side-effects for the PCOS-associated gut microbiota to include other phenotypes by performing Phenome-wide MR analyses for a range of diseases: gut microbiota \u2192 PheWAS.

Data source for exposure  The genetic data for gut microbiota were gathered from the international MiBioGen consortium\u2019s large-scale GWAS. [ 24 ] A total of 18,340 samples of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 24 population-based cohorts were used in this study. The relevant cohorts were conducted in several nations, including the United States, Canada, Israel, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom. Twenty of these cohorts were made up of people of a single ancestry, with the majority being of European heritage (16 cohorts, N\u2005=\u200513,266). The participants\u2019 mean age ranged from 50 to 62 years across the 24 cohorts (17 cohorts, N\u2005=\u200513,804). A total of 211 gut microbiomes were found, ranging from genus to phylum, with 131 genera, 16 classes, 35 families, 20 orders, and 9 phyla identified. Fifteen microbial taxa with no distinct species names (family or genus unknown) were eliminated, leaving 196 bacterial taxa in this study. All summary-level data utilized in the primary analysis were obtained from the publicly available at http://www.mibiogen.org .    2.3. Data source for mediation  A large-sample research of European or mixed populations yielded all GWAS summary-level information on risk variables for PCOS. The PCOS-related risk factors includes fasting insulin, fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and total cholesterol. Dataset ID, sample size, and ancestry of GWAS from publicly accessible resources in this study were summarized in Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 .    2.4. Data source for outcome  PCOS data were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of 10,074 cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry which was diagnosed according to NIH, Rotterdam criteria or self-diagnosis. [ 25 ] Cases were diagnosed with PCOS based on NIH or Rotterdam Criteria or by self-report. The NIH criteria for PCOS necessitate the presence of both OD and clinical and/or biochemical HA. [ 26 ] Two of the 3 Rotterdam requirements must be met: (1) OD defined by oligo- or amenorrhea, (2) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and (3) PCOM for diagnosis of PCOS. [ 27 ]    2.5. Statistical analyses  Figure 1 shows the workflow for statistical analysis. By performing a two-sample MR analysis using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach, network relationships between the gut microbiota, PCOS-related risk factors, and PCOS were identified.  First, in order to investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PCOS by using the IVW method, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are independently related with gut microbiota were chosen as genetic IVs. The following criteria were used to identify the IVs: (a) P <\u20051\u2005\u00d7\u200510 \u20105 as the threshold for statistical significance; (b) r 2 <\u20050.001 and clump window\u2005>\u200510,000\u2009kb among SNPs as the independent threshold of SNPs in pairwise linkage disequilibrium. The odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to calculate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PCOS risk. Bonferroni correction was used to control for multiple testing. Further, to validate the robustness of the results, we performed sensitivity analyses using a variety of comparable MR methods, including Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier, [ 28 ] weighted median (MR-Median), [ 29 ] maximum likelihood (MR-Maxlik), [ 30 ] and IVW radial. [ 31 ] The MR-Egger test for directional pleiotropy was used to determine whether the key MR assumptions were violated as a result of directional pleiotropy, [ 29 ] where the intercept is a helpful indicator of whether directed horizontal pleiotropy is driving the results of MR study. [ 32 ]  Next, the causal direction from risk factors (fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, BMI, WC, WHR, SHBG, LH, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol) to PCOS was analyzed using IVW regression using significance threshold of P <\u20055\u2005\u00d7\u200510 \u20108 to identify SNPs that were potentially related to risk factors. In addition, the sensitivity analyses were also performed.  Then, we conducted a network MR to quantify the impacts of gut microbiota on PCOS via risk factors that causally correlate with both gut microbiota and PCOS. To decompose direct and indirect effects, we used the Product method to estimate the indirect effect and the Delta method to estimate the standard error and 95% CI for the direct and indirect effects. [ 33 ]  Finally, we performed Phenowide-MR studies for a variety of disorders, including chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, major depression, depression, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, estradiol levels, hypertension, overweight, type 2 diabetes, et al to broaden the investigation of side-effects for the gut microbiota to include phenotypes. The above mentioned method was employed. The brief information of GWAS data from publicly accessible resources in this study were listed in Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 .  All MR analyses were performed using the package \u201cTwo-Sample-MR\u201d and \u201cMR-PRESSO,\u201d and \u201cRadial MR\u201d in R Software (version 4.2.1, The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). We plotted results as forest plots using the ggplot2 package in R. Bonferroni-corrected P threshold was used as statistical significance accounting for the MR analyses.    2.6. Ethical statement  Ethical approval and consent were not required as this study was based on publicly available data.     3. Results   3.1. Causal association between gut microbiota and PCOS  We performed MR analysis of all 211 gut microbiota with PCOS using SNPs with P <\u20051\u2005\u00d7\u200510 \u20105 selected as genetic IVs. However, there were 5 taxa that did not find IVs estimation that met the standard. In MR analysis using summary-level data, 10 taxa were observed with significant causal associations with PCOS risk ( P \u2264\u2005.05) (Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 ). After multiple testing correction (for genus: 0.05/127; for family: 0.05/34; for order: 0.05/20; for class: 0.05/16; for phylum: 0.05/9), genus Sellimonas id.14369 were observed with significant causal associations with PCOS risk ( OR =\u20050.69, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.84, P =\u20051.22\u2005\u00d7\u200510 -4 ) (Fig. 2 A). There was no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy due to MR-Egger intercept ( \u03b2 =\u2005\u20100.07, SE =\u20050.08, P =\u2005.4052) (Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 ). In addition, Sellimonas retained nominal statistical significance after a series of sensitivity analyses and yielded consistent causal effect estimates (Fig. 2 B and Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 ).   Figure 2.   Causal associations between gut microbiota and PCOS risk. (A) Causal associations between all gut microbita and PCOS risk inferred by IVW analysis.

Blue represents genus, green represents family, red represents order, yellow represents class, and purple represents phylum. (B) Causal association between Sellimonas and PCOS risk was inferred using different MR analytical methods for association between genetic variants and metabolites, including MR-PRESSO, MR-Median, MR-Maxlik, and MR-radial. IVW = inverse-variance weighted; MR-Maxlik = maximum likelihood; MR-Median = weighted median; MR-PRESSO = Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier; MR-radial = IVW radial; PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome.       3.2. Identification of likely causal PCOS risk factors  WC and BMI were identified as casual risk factors for PCOS risk ( OR WC =\u20053.11, 95% CI: 1.85\u20135.23, P =\u20051.96\u2005\u00d7\u200510 -5 ; OR BMI =\u20053.46, 95% CI: 2.51\u20134.76, P =\u20053.29\u2005\u00d7\u200510 \u201014 ; Fig. 3 ). And the MR sensitivity analyses including MR-Maxlik, MR-Median, IVW radial, and MR PRESSO showed similar effect estimates (Fig. 3 ). However, HOMA-IR, SHBG, and LH did not find IVs that met the significance threshold of P <\u20055\u2005\u00d7\u200510 \u20108 . In addition, although the results of WHR obtained using the IVW method were causally associated with increased PCOS risk ( OR WHR =\u20051.59, 95% CI: 1.01\u20132.52, P =\u2005.0475; Fig. 3 ), sensitivity analysis showed that the results are not robust.   Figure 3.   Causal associations between risk factors and PCOS risk. Forest plot shows the causal relationships among risk factors and PCOS risk using different MR analytical methods, including fasting insulin (FI), fasting glucose (FG), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC). OR and 95% CIs represent causal effects of risk factors on PCOS risk. CI = confidence interval, MR = Mendelian randomization, OR = odds ratio, PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome.       3.3. Mediation effect of gut microbiota on PCOS through risk factors  Interestingly, MR analysis suggested a significant causal association between Sellimonas and BMI ( b per 1 SD increment =\u2005\u20100.04, 95% CI: \u20100.07 to \u20100.01, P =\u2005.0239, Fig. 4 ), while Sellimonas did not shown significantly causal association with WHR ( b =\u2005\u20100.03, 95% CI: \u20100.07 to 0.01, P =\u2005.0717, Fig. 4 ). Further, we observed an indirect effect of Sellimonas on PCOS through BMI ( b =\u2005\u20100.05, 95% CI: \u20100.09 to \u20100.01, Fig. 4 ), with a mediated proportion of 12.82% of the total effect. WC did not have significant mediation effect in causal relation of Sellimonas on PCOS ( b =\u2005\u20100.04, 95% CI: \u20100.09 to 0.01, Fig. 4 ). For the causal pathway linking Sellimonas and PCOS risk reduction, the causal effect is mediated by decreasing BMI, but it is unlikely to be mediated by changing the WC.   Figure 4.   Network MR analysis of the relationship among Sellimonas, BMI, and PCOS risk. Network MR analysis shows the effect of Sellimonas on PCOS risk via BMI. Beta and 95% CIs represent indirect effects of Sellimonas on PCOS risk mediated through BMI, and the mediation proportion of Sellimonas on PCOS risk was mediated by affecting BMI. BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, MR = Mendelian randomization, PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome.       3.4. Phenome-wide MR analysis of Sellimonas-related phenotypes  In order to assess whether the Sellimonas have beneficial or harmful effects on other diseases other than PCOS, we screened the diseases with high incidence rate (number of cases\u2005>\u200510000) in the UK Biobank, and then carried out systematic and comprehensive Phenome-wide MR screening on these 830 non repetitive diseases and phenotypes (Table S4, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 ). Phenome-wide MR results can be explained as the probability of a specific disease or trait occurring is higher or lower for every 1 SD increase in genetically determined Sellimonas. Overall, we identified a total of 44 associations, of which 22 (50%) were considered beneficial (Table S4, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/N733 ).  Notably, a higher genetic level of Sellimonas is associated with a lower risk of not only PCOS, but also other diseases involving the circulatory system (chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic stroke), metabolic characteristics (estradiol levels, hypertension, overweight, type 2 diabetes), cancer (ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer) and nervous system disease (schizophrenia, major depression, depression). In these diseases, we observed the protective effects of Sellimonas on type 2 diabetes and depression (for type 2 diabetes: OR =\u20050.95, 95% CI: 0.90\u20130.99, P =\u2005.0366, Fig. 5 A; for depression: OR =\u20050.99, 95% CI: 0.98\u20131.00, P =\u2005.0210; for major depression: OR =\u20050.97, 95% CI: 0.94\u20130.99, P =\u2005.0068, Fig. 5 A). However, genetically high levels of Sellimonas are associated with a increasing of estradiol levels ( \u03b2 =\u20050.28; 95%CI: 0.11\u20130.57; P =\u20051.65\u2005\u00d7\u200510 -3 , Fig. 5 A).   Figure 5.   Phenowide-MR analyses results of genus Sellimonas in UK Biobank. (A) Forest plot shows the causal relationships among Sellimonas and diseases and phenotypes of UK Biobank using Phenowide-MR analyses. (B) Mediation analyses show the relationships among Sellimonas, BMI, and depression, type 2 diabetes, and estradiol levels. BMI = body mass index, MR = Mendelian randomization.     Importantly, we used MR analysis to find that BMI was related to risk factors for type 2 diabetes (for BMI \u2192 type 2 diabetes: OR =\u20052.35, 95% CI: 2.07\u20132.66, P =\u20055.01\u2005\u00d7\u200510 -41 , Fig. 5 B). Then we summarized the causal evidence obtained from MR analysis and the biological evidence obtained from pathway analysis, so we observed such a causal path, linking gut microbiota with type 2 diabetes: gut microbiota \u2192 BMI \u2192 type 2 diabetes. The causal path between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetes are also jointly mediated by BMI.     4. Discussion  In recent years, with the increasing research on the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic diseases, it also provides a new idea for the etiology and pathological mechanism of PCOS. Some studies have shown a relationship between PCOS and gut microbiota, but there is limited evidence on the causal role of gut microbiota in PCOS. In order to provide feasible strategies for prevention and treatment of PCOS, we used MR method to comprehensively analyze the published PCOS GWAS data and gut microbiota summary-level data in this study. We determined that Sellimonas is a protective gut microbiota on PCOS risk and the causal effect of BMI on PCOS risk. Network MR analysis further suggests that Sellimonas may affect PCOS through BMI. WC was estimated to positively associated with PCOS risk, but not mediate the Sellimonas on PCOS. We also prove that Sellimonas are genetically related to the low risk of type 2 diabetes and depression, but associated with a increasing of estradiol levels using Phenome-wide MR analysis. Then we summarized a causal path, linking gut microbiota with PCOS and diabetes: gut microbiota \u2192 BMI \u2192 type 2 diabetes. Since gut microbiota may play a role in the occurrence of PCOS and many clinical symptoms, our results may provide new ideas to illustrate that the treatment of PCOS with gut microbiota as a target shows great potential.  Changes in the taxonomic organization of the gut microbiota have been linked to PCOS in studies conducted over the past 5 years using both human and animal models. [ 21 ] Previous research has clearly demonstrated that changes in the gut microbiota of PCOS patients are connected with obesity, since these changes were detected in both normal and obese PCOS women, as well as teenage girls with both PCOS and obesity, as compared to women without this disease. [ 34 ] Recent studies have shown that compared to healthy women, the alpha diversity of gut microbiota in patients with PCOS has changed, [ 35 ] while in fecal samples \u03b2 diversity can also change. [ 36 ] Previous studies showed that the number of Bacteroides vulgaris in the intestines of patients with PCOS significantly increased, which may be the primary factor causing the abnormality of their gut microbiota, leading to a significant decrease in the level of bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria metabolism; bile acid can inhibit local ovarian inflammation and alleviate symptoms by activating certain cells in the intestine and secreting cytokines interleukin-22. When treated with bile acid GDCA or interleukin-22 in PCOS mice, it can significantly improve hormone abnormalities, estrous cycle disorders, polycystic ovarian changes, fertility decline, and insulin resistance. [ 21 ] However, there is still a lack of strong randomized controlled trials to determine the correlation between gut microbiota disorders and the risk of PCOS. Therefore, our study used the IVs estimation method based on aggregate data to explore the causal impact of intestinal microbiota on PCOS, while avoiding the interference of confounding factors and reverse causal correlation on the results. Our research findings provide important support for future investigations in this field to confirm this causal relationship and elucidate potential mechanisms.  Sellimonas intestinalis is a type of bacteria found in our study to be closely related to PCOS. Sellimonas intestinalis is a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium species that was previously thought to be uncultivable. [ 37 ] It is a member of the Lachnospiraceae family and the Firmicutes phylum. Sellimonas was used as a biomarker of intestinal homeostasis recovery, which helps to advance the characterization of gut microbiota members with beneficial potential. In particular, the ability of Lachnospiraceae to create a range of metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), during glucose fermentation has piqued the interest of researchers, primarily acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. The abnormal metabolism of SCFAs may be related to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in patients with PCOS. [ 38 ] At present, there are many strains of edible probiotics (or probiotics) that can directly produce intestinal metabolites to improve PCOS, such as bifidobacterium V9, [ 39 ] Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Enterococcus. [ 40 ] After treatment, LH can be reduced and intestinal SCFAs can be increased. With a better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in PCOS, interventions targeting gut microbiota, such as lifestyle intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal bacteria transplantation, may become a new treatment program in the future.  In addition, we found that high level of Sellimonas would reduce BMI and thus reduce the occurrence of PCOS through network MR method, and BMI mediated 12.82% of the total effect. This also indicates the importance of Short-chain fatty acid in the occurrence and development of PCOS. Through Clusters of Orthologous Groups analysis of the integrated genome data of Sellimonas, it was found that these genes are the determining factors in the metabolic process leading to SCFAs production during glucose fermentation, [ 41 ] mainly butyric acid. [ 42 ] SCFAs can bind to free fatty acid receptors expressed in intestinal tract, fat, skeletal muscle, liver, immune system, nervous system and other tissues, and inhibit the secretion of orexin by gastric mucosa. [ 43 ] These hormones can not only inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and sex hormone, but also prevent the transformation of sex hormones, such as estrogen to androgen. [ 44 ] The lower the levels of these appetite stimulating hormones, the higher the levels of androgens. Patients with PCOS have lower levels of orexin compared to women without PCOS. [ 45 ] Therefore, the use of a combination of microbiota transplantation and lifestyle interventions for the treatment of PCOS and the overall intervention of the patient\u2019s intestinal microbiota is a future that requires further research.  We further used a Phenome-wide MR study to find that high levels of Sellimonas were associated with a reduced risk of depression and type 2 diabetes, and with an increased estradiol level. Patients with PCOS generally have psychological problems such as depression and anxiety, Sellimonas were associated with increased depressive symptoms in our study and also consistent with the findings of the Djawad Radjabzadeh et al Study. [ 46 ] Patients with PCOS may develop emotional issues due to improper information transmission in the gut-brain axis. [ 47 ] An important pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, and obesity is an important factor for insulin resistance. [ 48 ] Changes in the structure and function of gut microbiota can promote the occurrence of obesity. [ 49 ] SCFAs can not only provide host with energy and nutrients required for bacterial growth and reproduction, but also serve as Signaling molecule for energy regulation. [ 50 ] Mice lacking SCFAs G-protein-coupled receptors 41 and 43 were lighter than wild type mice. [ 51 ] Thus, gut microbiota may become a new therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes in the future.  Our analysis has a number of advantages. First, data from 24 population-based cohorts from the large genetic consortia MiBioGen (n\u2005=\u200518,340) and the PCOS GWAS meta-analysis (n\u2005=\u2005113,238) increased the statistical ability to identify minor effects in complicated traits. [ 52 ] Second, the MR investigation avoided potential biases based on the 3 fundamental assumptions. [ 53 ] Third, the sensitivity analysis using several MR approaches revealed consistent results, including MR-Maxlik, MR-Median, IVW radial, and MR PRESSO methods. Further, we not only conducted network MR analysis on gut microbiota to analyze the complex causal mechanism between gut microbiota and PCOS, but also conducted Phenome-wide MR analysis to determine the potential role of this gut microbiota in other diseases and phenotypes.  There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, gut microbiota may also be associated with other factors such as health status, age, and testosterone levels, which may mediate the impact of gut microbiota on PCOS, including urinary and reproductive health outcomes. However, whether these factors play a mediating role between gut microbiota and PCOS has not been included in our main research due to data limitations and should be explored in future research. Secondly, the potential biological mechanism of Sellimonas on the risk of PCOS, type 2 diabetes and depression mediated by BMI remains unclear. Therefore, more molecular experiments are needed to validate the findings of this study. Finally, our datasets only contained European populations, limiting the results\u2019 application to non-European populations. More research is needed to confirm the applicability of these findings in different demographics and ethnicities in the future.    5. Conclusions  In conclusion, we conducted network MR analysis using a large population of European cohorts to reveal the causal effect of gut microbiota and metabolic characteristics on PCOS, and found that Sellimonas may be a protective factor of PCOS, which can affect the occurrence of PCOS through BMI. In addition, we also explored the influence of Sellimonas on a wide range of diseases, and found its potential causal effect on type 2 diabetes and depression. The research findings warrant further research to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying the causal relationship between Sellimonas and PCOS, and emphasize the importance of addressing obesity and metabolic issues in preventing and managing PCOS.
