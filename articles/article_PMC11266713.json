Weight loss interventions led to substantial and comparable weight loss in both groups; however, altered eating behaviors were specifically noted among women without PCOS.    1  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, with a prevalence of approximately 10% in women of fertile age.  1  The condition is characterized by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, leading to a spectrum of symptoms including reproductive disturbances such as oligo\u2010anovulation and infertility,  2  hirsutism, metabolic disturbances, including hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension,  3  ,  4  as well as psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.  5    The prevalence of obesity (BMI \u226530\u2009kg/m 2 ) in Sweden is 16%, with a predominance of severe obesity among women compared to men.  6  A strong association exists between PCOS and obesity, with a 50%\u201370% prevalence of obesity in American women with PCOS  7  and a 34% prevalence of obesity in a Nordic population of women with PCOS.  8  The reasons for the association between PCOS and obesity remain unclear, but it has been shown that women with PCOS have a higher rate of weight gain than women without PCOS, especially in early adulthood.  9  However, previous studies have identified comparable resting metabolic rate, energy intake, and physical activity in women with and without PCOS of fertile age across normal\u2010 and overweight categories.  10  ,  11  Nevertheless, a higher prevalence of disordered eating and binge eating disorders (BEDs) has been observed in women with PCOS.  12    Lifestyle treatment, including dietary modifications, physical activity, and behavioral adjustments, is regarded as the first\u2010line therapeutic approach for weight management, aimed at both weight loss and maintenance of a healthy body weight in women with PCOS.  13  In women with PCOS, such interventions are considered beneficial in alleviating symptoms associated with PCOS and preventing metabolic complications associated with PCOS over time.  14  Despite this, there are few studies examining dietary intake, physical activity, and eating behavior in women with severe obesity (BMI \u226535\u2009kg/m 2 ) and PCOS during obesity treatment.  This study aimed to investigate self\u2010reported eating behavior, energy intake, and physical activity before and after a 12\u2010month weight loss intervention in a cohort of women with severe obesity, with and without PCOS, and to compare the results within and between the two groups.    2  MATERIAL AND METHODS   2.1  Design setting and participants  This is a prospective clinical trial carried out between 2011 and 2017, at the Regional Obesity Center at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, to which the participants had been referred for weight loss treatment. Women aged 18\u201350\u2009years were invited to the present study. Before initiation of a weight loss intervention, all individuals that consented to participate underwent screening for PCOS using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, requiring both oligo\u2010/anovulation and the presence of clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, with the exclusion of other endocrine disorders. The diagnostic procedure for PCOS has been described in detail earlier.  15  Subsequently, before the start of treatment and at 12\u2009months, patients underwent anthropometric assessments and laboratory sampling and responded to self\u2010administered questionnaires regarding eating behavior, dietary intake, and physical activity. The same questionnaires were completed by the participants at both baseline and follow\u2010up. At baseline, based on PCOS status, participants were categorically assigned to two groups: PCOS and non\u2010PCOS.    2.2  Anthropometry and biochemistry  Body height, weight, and waist circumference were measured according to standard protocol at baseline and at 12\u2009months. BMI was calculated by kg/m 2 .  16      2.3  Eating behavior  The 21\u2010item Three\u2010Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ\u2010R21)  17  is a questionnaire assessing eating behavior divided into three subscales that cover different eating behavior domains: emotional eating (EE), cognitive restraint eating (CR), and uncontrolled eating (UE). EE subscale assess eating as a response to emotions, cognitive restraint eating subscale assess consciously choosing to restrict food intake to lose or maintain weight and uncontrolled eating subscale assess loss of control regarding eating. Raw scores were transformed into scaled scores of 1\u2013100, where higher scores for each subscale indicate greater emotional eating, greater cognitive restraint eating, and greater emotional eating characteristics.    2.4  Binge eating disorder  The identification of BED was done according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM\u20105) criteria,  18  based on questions from the Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns\u2010revised (QEWP\u2010r), which has been translated and validated in the translated version.  19      2.5  Dietary intake  Dietary intake was assessed with a validated semi\u2010quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and covered habitual dietary intake over the last 3\u2009months when completing the FFQ.  20  Energy and nutrient calculations were done with the food database from the Swedish Food Agency.  21      2.6  Physical activity  To assess physical activity, the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)  22  was used. IPAQ is a validated questionnaire with nine items, measuring recalled physical activity during the last 7\u2009days with information on the time spent walking, activities of vigorous or moderate intensity, and sedentary activity/sitting. Answers were given in hours and minutes.    2.7  Intervention  All participants started the 12\u2010month weight loss intervention with a 12\u2010week period of a very low\u2010energy diet (VLED), which has been described in detail before.  15  The VLED regimen consisted of a liquid diet with a calorie intake of 450\u2013800\u2009kcal per day.  23  Subsequently, solid foods were gradually introduced within the context of an energy\u2010reduced diet, with caloric content adjusted to achieve a reduction of 30% from the estimated energy requirements for weight maintenance. The reintroduction of solid foods followed a step\u2010based pattern, starting with one meal at a time, starting with breakfast, and continuing with VLED at the other meals during the day. After 6\u2009weeks, the next meal was reintroduced, and after another 6\u2009weeks, the third meal was reintroduced. By that time, the participants had no meals left with VLED. Dietary advice within the framework of an energy\u2010reduced diet included more foods with low energy density, eg vegetables, fruits, and foods with high satiation effects, eg whole\u2010grain cereals. Counseling regarding physical activity was given during the whole treatment period and was individualized in relation to the preferences of the participants. Appointments were scheduled once a month for all participants with either a study nurse or a dietician. These appointments included weight assessments and support for both dietary modifications and increased physical activity.    2.8  Statistical analyses  Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 27.0 software. Normally distributed data was presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and skewed data was presented as median and IQ range. Between\u2010group comparisons of women with and without PCOS were conducted using a Student's t \u2010test for normally distributed variables or Mann\u2013Whitney U \u2010test for skewed variables, adjusting for age with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The chi\u2010squared test was used when comparing the proportions of BEDs.  Changes from baseline to 12\u2009months within groups were assessed using a paired t\u2010test and Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test, and independent samples t \u2010test for comparing changes between the groups. Correlations were determined using the Spearman correlation test. The results were considered statistically significant at p <\u20090.05.     3  RESULTS  At baseline, a total of 246 women characterized by severe obesity volunteered to participate in the study (PCOS n =\u200963, non\u2010PCOS n =\u2009183). The characteristics of the included participants are shown in Table 1 . Women with PCOS were younger (PCOS 33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\u2009years, non\u2010PCOS 37.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7\u2009years; p <\u20090.001) compared to women without PCOS. No differences in BMI were observed between the two groups (PCOS 39.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7\u2009kg/m 2 , non\u2010PCOS 39.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3\u2009kg/m 2 ; p =\u20090.787; Table 1 ).

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; E%, energy percent; IQ range, interquartile range; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; SD, standard deviation.     At 12 months, a total of 72 women (PCOS, n =\u200921; non\u2010PCOS, n =\u200968) had completed the follow\u2010up assessments. Compared to baseline, women with PCOS lost 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.3\u2009kg, p <\u20090.001, and women without PCOS lost 14.0\u2009kg\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5, p <\u20090.001, with no difference between groups ( p =\u20090.616). The percentage of weight loss was 11.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4% for women with PCOS and 12.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5% for those without PCOS.   3.1  Eating behavior  At baseline, women with PCOS had higher scores of cognitive restraint eating compared to women without PCOS ( p =\u20090.012; Figure 1 ). However, no significant differences were found between the groups in emotional eating or uncontrolled eating (Table 1 ). The prevalence of BED did not differ between the PCOS and non\u2010PCOS groups (PCOS: 11.5%; non\u2010PCOS: 17.5%, p =\u20090.27).

Among women with PCOS who completed the 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, no significant difference was observed in self\u2010reported eating behavior compared to baseline. Conversely, women without PCOS reported reductions in uncontrolled eating and emotional eating and increased cognitive restraint eating compared to baseline (Table 2 ). At the 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, none of the 21 women with PCOS received a diagnosis of BED, while four out of the 68 women without PCOS were diagnosed with BED.

Among women with PCOS who remained at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, a reduced intake of energy percent (E%) fat was found compared to baseline (Table 2 ). Women without PCOS reported a reduction in energy intake, E% carbohydrates, and sugars, increased E% protein, and reduced iron intake compared to baseline (Table 2 ). No statistically significant changes in micronutrients were found within groups at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up or in change between groups (Table 2 ).  Furthermore, at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, women with PCOS reported increased time spent on medium\u2010to\u2010vigorous activity, while women without PCOS reported reduced time spent walking (Table 2 ).    3.3  12\u2010month follow\u2010up  From baseline to follow\u2010up, a difference in cognitive restraint eating was found with a higher increase in that score in the non\u2010PCOS group compared with the PCOS\u2010group ( p =\u20090.004), for fat intake, where women with PCOS decreased fat intake more ( p =\u20090.024), and in carbohydrate intake and sugar intake, where women without PCOS decreased their intake more, with both nutrients ( p =\u20090.017) compared to women with PCOS.    3.4  Weight change categories  All participants, independent of PCOS status, were divided into two weight change categories: <5% or weight gain, and \u226510% (Table 3 ). Within the \u226510% weight loss group, weight loss was \u221224.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8%, and in the <5% weight loss or weight gain group, weight loss was \u22120.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0% (Table 3 ). Women in the \u226510% weight loss group reported higher cognitive restraint eating ( p =\u20090.002), lower emotional eating ( p =\u20090.047), and more time spent in sedentary activity ( p =\u20090.037) compared to those in the <5% weight loss group. No differences were found between the two weight change categories for emotional eating (Table 3 ).

Abbreviations: E%, energy percent; IQ range, interquartile range; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; SD, standard deviation.       3.5  Correlations  At baseline, within both groups, a negative correlation was found between cognitive restraint and energy intake ( r =\u2009\u22120.315, p <\u20090.05 [PCOS group], r =\u2009\u22120.214, p <\u20090.001 [non\u2010PCOS group]), whereas uncontrolled eating demonstrated a positive correlation with energy intake ( r =\u20090.263, p <\u20090.05 [PCOS group], r =\u20090.402, p <\u20090.001 [non\u2010PCOS group]; Table 4 ). A positive correlation was found between emotional eating and energy intake only in women without PCOS ( r =\u20090.400, p <\u20090.001; Table 4 ). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between reported E% fat at baseline and weight change in the PCOS\u2010group ( r =\u2009\u22120.470, p <\u20090.05). In women without PCOS, a negative correlation was found between baseline sedentary behavior/sitting time and weight change ( r =\u2009\u22120.268, p <\u20090.05) and a negative correlation between baseline uncontrolled eating and weight change ( r =\u2009\u22120.298, p <\u20090.05; Table 4 ).

This behavior was associated with lower energy intake, whereas uncontrolled eating was associated with higher energy intake in both women with and without PCOS. After a weight loss intervention with clinically significant and similar weight loss in both groups, altered eating behaviors were noted only in women without PCOS. Those who lost \u226510% in weight, independent of PCOS status, after the 12\u2010month intervention reported higher cognitive restraint eating behavior and less emotional eating.  In this study, women with PCOS demonstrated elevated cognitive restraint eating behavior at baseline in comparison to their counterparts without PCOS, while scores for emotional and uncontrolled eating were similar between the two groups. Cognitive restraint eating behavior entails a heightened preoccupation with the type and quantity of food consumed to influence bodyweight and shape, representing an eating behavior that promotes weight loss or weight maintenance.  24  Notably, earlier research on eating behavior in women with PCOS has found inconsistent results. Larsson et\u00a0al.  10  found no differences in eating behavior between women with and without PCOS, while Basar et\u00a0al.  25  showed elevated cognitive restraint eating in women with PCOS. It is relevant to note that both of these studies included women with a mean BMI ranging from overweight to obesity but not severe obesity.  10  ,  25  Thus, the result of the present study is supported by the study of Basar et\u00a0al.,  25  which shows that cognitive restraint eating behavior is more prevalent in women with severe obesity and PCOS compared to women with severe obesity without PCOS. One plausible explanation for the elevated cognitive restraint eating in women with severe obesity and PCOS could be attributed to the perception of being overweight and the multiple weight loss attempts that have been shown in women with PCOS  26  that may contribute to an increased awareness of weight\u2010related concerns.  The prevalence of BED in the general population ranges from 1%\u20132% to 14%\u201319% in populations with severe obesity,  27  which is in line with our results. In the present study, no difference in BED could be found between PCOS and the non\u2010PCOS groups. This stands in contrast to previous studies, indicating a higher prevalence of any eating disorder, including BED, in women with PCOS.  12  However, studies specifically addressing BEDs in women with PCOS are limited.  A substantial variation in self\u2010reported energy intake was noted, as reflected by large standard deviations in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between groups. Previous studies in women with PCOS have reported similar levels of energy intake when compared with women without PCOS.  10  It is important to note that self\u2010reported data on energy intake introduce the potential for reporting bias. However, when utilizing the mean estimated energy requirements for weight stability, according to the Mifflin St. Jeor equation,  28  the reported energy intake at baseline in both groups was comparable with the energy requirements for the participants' weight at the time, which implies a reasonably accurate reporting of the energy intake at baseline.  The adherence during the strict VLED period was high due to the average weight loss during that period (data not shown). In another study on patients with psoriatic arthritis, we collected data on participants' experiences of the VLED period and their return from VLED to regular foods.  29  The participants found the strict VLED period easy to implement, while the return to regular foods was more difficult.  29  Although this is another patient group, it could be assumed that difficulties regarding dietary change for weight loss are similar regardless of diagnosis.  Baseline physical activity in both study groups falls below the recommended levels outlined for adults by the World Health Organization (WHO),  30  which are also the recommendations for women with PCOS.  13  This observation is comparable with prior findings indicating reduced physical activity in individuals with obesity  31  and supports the inverse relationship documented between body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.  32    During the strict VLED period, energy intake is markedly reduced to facilitate significant and rapid weight loss, with the aim of encouraging further behavioral changes for weight loss.  23  Due to this intervention, including VLED, both groups reduced significantly in weight from baseline to follow\u2010up. The important finding was that women with PCOS responded to the weight loss intervention similarly to women without PCOS, with comparable average weight loss in both groups. Based on clinical experience, women with PCOS may say that due to having PCOS, they have more difficulties losing weight than women without PCOS. However, the present study shows that they respond to a weight loss treatment as well as women without PCOS, and this information may be used in discussions with women with PCOS and obesity. A reduction in self\u2010reported energy intake was seen only in women without PCOS. This was associated with an increased intake of protein and a decreased intake of carbohydrates and sugar at the 12\u2010month follow\u2010up. In women with PCOS, self\u2010reported energy intake did not decrease significantly; however, a reduction in E% fat was found. Although a reduction in E% sugar was found in women without PCOS, both groups reported a very high sugar intake both before and after weight loss intervention, with an almost double intake compared to recommendations from international guidelines.  33  Comparing changes between groups, women with PCOS reduced fat intake more than women without PCOS, whereas women without PCOS reduce their intake of carbohydrates and sugar more than women with PCOS. Previous studies showed no difference in weight loss after a low\u2010fat diet compared to a low\u2010carbohydrate diet,  34  and indeed, the two groups in the present study did not differ in weight loss.  Wang et\u00a0al.  35  observed reduced energy intake and significant but modest weight loss in women with severe obesity, both in those with and without PCOS, following a 6\u2010month lifestyle intervention. This study was a post\u2010hoc analysis of a treatment group in a randomized controlled study in women scheduled for infertility treatment, with a dropout rate of 25% in the PCOS group and 20% in the non\u2010PCOS group, respectively.  35  Caution is warranted in interpreting the findings, as the motivation for weight loss may be influenced by the context of infertility treatment. However, the findings of the latter study support our results that women with obesity and PCOS can reduce their weight as well as women without PCOS. Although our study had a longer follow\u2010up, we also had a higher dropout rate compared to the study of Wang et\u00a0al.  35    Alterations in eating behavior after intervention, characterized by reductions in uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and increased cognitive restraint eating, and behaviors in favor of weight loss, were exclusively observed in women without PCOS. Women without PCOS also increased their cognitive restraint more compared to those with PCOS. These results are comparable with a previous study in women with overweight or obesity without PCOS, who underwent a 12\u2010week dietary intervention, resulting in modest weight loss with improvements in all three domains of eating behavior.  36  Conversely, in a 12\u2010month RCT in women with PCOS trying to achieve pregnancy, the lifestyle intervention resulted in 5% weight loss and the participants reported increased restraint eating post\u2010intervention.  37  However, these studies used different eating behavior questionnaires than the present study and did not compare women with and without PCOS.  The reason why women with PCOS, in the present study, showed no change in cognitive restraint eating while women without PCOS did could be explained by the limited number of participants at follow\u2010up, resulting in a potential lack of statistical power.  In women with obesity and PCOS, a weight loss greater than 5% has demonstrated improvement in symptoms of PCOS  38  ; however, most studies are small, and to date, international evidence\u2010based guidelines for PCOS do not recommend a specific percentage of weight loss for women with PCOS to improve hormonal and metabolic variables.  13  In the present study, categorizing participants based on weight loss, individuals achieving 10% weight loss exhibited higher cognitive restraint compared to those with <5% weight loss or weight gain. Due to the limited number of participants at follow\u2010up, categorization by PCOS diagnosis was not feasible. These results may imply that substantial weight loss can foster behavioral changes in favor of further weight loss, especially in women with severe obesity. This is supported by previous findings that indicate that individuals achieving rapid weight loss, which is often the case with treatment including VLED, are more likely to maintain long\u2010term weight loss.  39    In both groups, cognitive restraint eating exhibited a negative correlation with energy intake at baseline. Uncontrolled eating correlated positively with energy intake in women without PCOS, whereas this correlation was not evident in women with PCOS. These results indicate that cognitive restraint eating can favor weight loss, whereas uncontrolled eating can be a barrier to weight loss.  In women without PCOS, sedentary behavior/sitting time and uncontrolled eating were negatively correlated with weight loss; thus, the higher the baseline sedentary behavior/sitting time and uncontrolled eating, the greater the weight loss at 12 months. This seems contradictory but could be explained by the fact that more unfavorable behaviors for weight loss at baseline give room for larger behavioral changes during the intervention.  The strengths of this study include a relatively large baseline cohort with no statistically significant differences between the PCOS and non\u2010PCOS groups regarding anthropometric measures. Other strengths were the usage of validated questionnaires and the structured weight loss intervention with regular check\u2010up visits, as well as the long follow\u2010up time of 12\u2009months. Limitations include the selected group of women with severe obesity, and therefore the generalizability to other age\u2010 and BMI groups is limited. Additionally, self\u2010reported dietary intake is another limitation, where participants may tend to both under\u2010report and mis\u2010report dietary intake. However, average energy intake seems reasonable in relation to energy needs for the average baseline weight in both women with and without PCOS.  The substantial dropout impedes the power of the study, potentially explaining the absence of statistically significant changes. High drop\u2010out rates are common in weight loss interventions, and this study falls within the upper interval, possibly caused by the follow\u2010up time of the study. Those dropping out of weight loss studies tend to be those who lose less weight during the intervention or those who are younger than 50\u2009years,  40  as women were in this study. In women with PCOS specifically, drop\u2010out from a weight loss intervention is associated with more depressive symptoms, while higher appointment attendance is associated with a greater adherence rate and a greater weight loss.  41    Notably, no difference in age, anthropometry, or metabolic parameters was observed between dropouts and completers in the present study.  15      5  CONCLUSION  In this prospective study of women with severe obesity, those with PCOS reported higher conscious control regarding eating than women without PCOS, a behavior correlated with lower self\u2010reported energy intake irrespective of PCOS status. A 1\u2010year weight loss program resulted in clinically significant weight loss in both groups but did not elicit discernible effects on eating behavior in women with PCOS. In contrast, the intervention induced alterations in eating behavior among women without PCOS that may be favorable for further weight loss or the maintenance of achieved weight loss. To evaluate long\u2010term effects of weight loss intervention on eating behavior, longer follow\u2010up studies regarding eating behavior after weight loss intervention is warranted in women with severe obesity and PCOS.
