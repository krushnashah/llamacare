    "body": "1  Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS) is a complex gynecological endocrine\nand metabolic disease with a prevalence rate of 8\u201313% according\nto the population studied and the definitions used. 1 PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenemia, infertility,\nand ovarian dysfunction and is associated with metabolic consequences,\nincluding insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and obesity. 2 Although the clinical experience is considerable,\nthe pathophysiology and molecular basis of PCOS are not fully understood\nbecause of its heterogeneity and complexity. 3  Proteomics is an efficient and powerful method to investigate\ncomplex\nbiological processes. 4 Previous relevant\nfindings have been discovered in proteomic studies of PCOS, providing\nmuch valuable information about the pathophysiology of PCOS. Recently,\nSim et al. performed a comparative proteomic analysis of human follicular\nfluid (FF) from PCOS and non-PCOS patients using two-dimensional gel\nelectrophoresis (2-DE) combined with mass spectrometry (MS). Seven\ndifferentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, which may\nserve as potential pathological biomarkers during oocyte development. 5 In addition, several proteins in serum samples,\nsuch as haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and lipoprotein lipase, have been\nidentified by MS with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification\n(iTRAQ) as candidate biomarkers in predicting the development of ovarian\nhyperstimulation syndrome among PCOS patients. 6 Another tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics and bioinformatics\nanalysis identified 70 DEPs in FF samples between infertile patients\nwith or without PCOS and found that the inflammatory response, regulation\nof protein metabolic processes, and lipid transport were deregulated\nin PCOS, which played important roles in the pathogenesis of PCOS. 7 These newly discovered proteins may be involved\nin the pathogenesis of PCOS, but it is still a challenge to identify\nproteins that may lead to PCOS development.  Over 50% of women\nwith PCOS are overweight or obese. 8 Evidence\nimplies that obesity worsens infertility,\nhyperandrogenemia, metabolism, and IR in PCOS patients. 9 Weight loss, which may improve pregnancy outcomes\nand endocrine disorders in obese PCOS patients, is the first-line\ntreatment for overweight women with PCOS. 10 The lipase inhibitor orlistat was found to improve or reverse the\npathological characteristics of PCOS patients and became the sole\nantiobesity agent available in various countries. 11 Kumar et al. found that orlistat was as effective as metformin\nin weight loss by improving the lipid profile and pregnancy rates\nin PCOS women. 12 Moreover, several studies\nhave shown that reduced testosterone levels were associated with orlistat\nadministration. 12 , 13 Only a small amount of research\non the mechanism of orlistat for the improvement in PCOS has been\nconducted, especially with regard to the proteome. In the present\nstudy, the effects of orlistat on PCOS rats induced by high-fat diet\nand letrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor widely used in PCOS\nmodeling, were carefully examined. 14 , 15 A TMT-based\nliquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was\nemployed to investigate the ovarian tissue proteomic changes between\nPCOS rats (PCOS group) and orlistat-treated PCOS rats (ORL-PCOS group),\nin order to better understand the underlying effect of orlistat on\nPCOS.    2  Results   2.1  Effects of Orlistat on\nBody Weight, Levels\nof Sex Hormones, and Estrous Cycle  To gain insight into the\npossible mechanisms, we constructed a PCOS rat model and used orlistat\nas a therapeutic intervention. In this study, after letrozole treatment\nand high-fat diet, the rats exhibited irregular estrous cycles, increased\nweight gain, increased circulating T and LH concentrations, and decreased\nlevel of serum E2, demonstrating that PCOS modeling was successful.\nAs shown in Figure 1 A, rats in the PCOS group exhibited a remarkable weight gain compared\nto those in the CON group ( p < 0.01), while treatment\nwith orlistat effectively reduced the increased body weight ( p < 0.05) in PCOS. Additionally, the levels of various\nsex hormones in the serum from the different groups were determined.\nCompared with those of the CON group, the levels of serum T, LH, and\nthe ratio of LH/FSH were significantly higher ( p <\n0.05; Figure 1 B,C,E),\nand the level of serum E2 was significantly lower ( p < 0.01; Figure 1 F) in the PCOS group. The rats in the orlistat-PCOS group had significantly\nlower levels of T ( p < 0.05; Figure 1 B), LH ( p <\n0.01; Figure 1 C), and\nthe ratio of LH/FSH ( p < 0.05; Figure 1 E) and higher levels of E2\n( p < 0.01; Figure 1 F) than those of the rats in PCOS group without orlistat\ntreatment. No differences were found in the FSH levels in the PCOS\nvs CON group and ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group ( Figure 1 D).   Figure 1   Effect of orlistat treatment on body weight\nand serum sex hormone\nlevels in letrozole-induced PCOS rats.

Estrous cycle assessment revealed that PCOS rats\nexperienced a\nlonger diestrus, shorter proestrus, and estrus than those of control\nrats ( Figure 2 A,B,D\u2013G).\nFollowing orlistat treatment, the estrous cycle disorder was partially\nrestored ( Figure 2 C,D\u2013G).

Volcano plots were mapped to show significant\ndifferences based on the fold change and p value\nin the PCOS vs CON group ( Figure 3 A) and ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group ( Figure 3 B). Compared with the CON group, 490 and\n305 proteins were upregulated and downregulated in the PCOS group,\nrespectively. Compared with the PCOS group, 35 and 84 proteins were\nupregulated and downregulated in the ORL-PCOS group, respectively.\nDetailed information on the DEPs is listed in Tables S1 and S2 .   Figure 3   (A) Volcano plot of proteins identified from\nPCOS vs CON group.\n(B) Volcano plot of proteins identified from ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group.\nThe volcano plot was mapped on the basis of the fold change and p values. Red and blue dots: DEPs; gray dots: proteins without\ndifference; DEPs: differentially expressed proteins; CON: control;\nPCOS: polycystic ovary syndrome; ORL-PCOS: orlistat-treated PCOS.       2.3  GO Enrichment Analysis\nof the DEPs  GO enrichment analysis of three distinctive functional\nsets, namely,\ncellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process\n(BP), was applied with a corrected statistically significant level\n( p < 0.05). In the BP category, DEPs in the PCOS\nvs CON group were primarily related to small-molecule metabolic processes\nand organic acid metabolic processes ( Figure 4 A). DEPs in the ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group were\nprimarily related to DNA biosynthetic processes and regulation of\nthe Toll-like receptor signaling pathways ( Figure 4 B). In terms of MF, DEPs in these two groups\nwere mainly involved in iron ion bindings.   Figure 4   Enriched GO terms of\nthe DEPs. (A) GO enrichment of the DEPs in\nPCOS vs CON group. (B) GO enrichment of the DEPs in ORL-PCOS vs PCOS\ngroup.

After orlistat treatment, the upregulated\nproteins in the ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group were mainly involved in galactose\nand galactose metabolism, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions,\nand the pathways associated with downregulated proteins were related\nto linoleic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and type\n1 diabetes mellitus ( Figure 5 B).

DEPs that\nconnected higher than others in the created network were considered\nas hub proteins ( Figure 6 ). These hub proteins might have significant roles in the regulation\nof the network. There were many hub proteins in the PCOS vs CON group\nPPI network, but in the ORL-PCOS group PPI network, only a few hub\nproteins were found, such as Prkdc and Nop14.

For example, n-3 PUFAs may effectively improve\nhyperandrogenism and IR in PCOS patients. 21 In addition, PLA2G4 was reported to regulate uterine prostaglandin\n(PG) production. 22 PGs, as lipid mediators,\nplay important roles in chronic inflammation and the development of\nmany reproductive events, disturbances of them are the characteristics\nof PCOS. 23 It was shown that the levels\nof PGs (PGD2, PGE2 PGI2, and PGF2\u03b1) were significantly higher\nin the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats than in those of healthy controls. 20 Consistent with a previous study, the upregulation\nof PLA2G4 and PLA2G2A was confirmed in the PCOS vs CON group, but\nthe downregulation of PLA2G4 and PLA2G2A was observed in the ORL-PCOS\nvs PCOS group, suggesting that orlistat restored the lipid metabolism\ndisorders, improved the levels of PUFAs, and decreased the levels\nof PGs in ovarian tissues of the PCOS by inhibiting the expression\nof these two proteins. Another protein that is involved in LA metabolism\nis PLAAT3, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the lipid storage\nof adipocytes. 24 Suppression of PLAAT3\nexpression significantly reduced the adipocyte-related gene expression\nand lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. 25 Jaworski et al. showed that the PLAAT3-deficient mice fed a high-fat\ndiet had a slower weight gain than wild-type mice, and significantly\nsmaller adipocytes in size and lower level of triacylglycerol. 26 Moreover, the amount of adipose prostaglandin\nE2 (PGE2) in PLAAT3-deficient mice was markedly reduced. 26 PGE2 was shown to promote adiposity in mice\nthrough inhibition of lipolysis. 27 Very\nrecently, it was reported that the level of PGE2 in FF was negatively\ncorrelated with the high-quality embryo rate in PCOS patients. 28 Therefore, we speculated that PLAAT3 might be\nan important effective target of orlistat on weight control and visceral\nwhite adipose tissue loss.  In the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis,\nwe found that aldo-keto\nreductase family 1, member B7 (AKR1B7), aldo-keto reductase family\n1, member B8 (AKR1B8), UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, and polypeptide\nB10 (Ugt2b10) were enriched in pentose and glucuronate interconversions,\nwhich was the most significantly upregulated pathway in the ORL-PCOS\nvs PCOS group. AKR1B8 is the structurally and functionally closest\nrelated protein of AKR1B7. 29 AKR1B7 is\na member of the aldo-keto reductases, which are NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases\nthat convert aldehydes and ketones to primary and secondary alcohols,\nrespectively. 30 AKR1B7 is expressed in\na restricted set of tissues, such as adrenal glands, intestine, reproductive\norgans, and liver. 31 AKR1B7 is a main regulator\nof white adipose tissue development. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, AKR1B7\noverexpression inhibited their differentiation, while knockout of\nAKR1B7 accelerated the adipogenesis process. 32 Moreover, the enrichment of AKR1B7 in the adipose stromal fraction\nplays a key role in preventing obesity in vivo by controlling the\ncontent of PGF2\u03b1. Compared with a standard diet, an aggravated\nobesity phenotype was observed in AKR1B7 knockout mice fed with an\nHFD, accompanied by a significant increase in the plasma levels of\ntriglycerides, glycerol, and free fatty acids. Hence, a lack of AKR1B7\ncauses severe overweight. 27 In addition,\nthe expression of AKR1B7 in the liver significantly reduces hepatic\nlipid accumulation and lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic mice,\nsuggesting that AKR1B7 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment\nof fatty liver disease related to diabetes. 33 A previous study also demonstrated a high level of AKR1B7 expression\nin ovarian theca cells after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment,\nsuggesting its important role in ovulatory processes. 34 However, another study reported that AKR1B7 expression\nwas dispensable for ovarian function. The estrous cycle and follicle\nmaturation appeared normal, while progesterone was decreased during\nestrous in AKR1B7 knockout mice. 35 In this\ncurrent study, the estrous cycle in the PCOS group basically stopped\nand most of them were in the diestrus period, which was consistent\nwith previous studies. Guo et al. found that the PCOS rats induced\nby letrozole were constantly in the diestrus stage. 36 Wu et al. also found that compared to normal rats, most\nof the PCOS rats induced by letrozole were in the diestrus phase. 37 Following orlistat treatment, the estrous cycle\ndisorder was partially restored. Orlistat significantly increased\nthe expression of AKR1B7, which was reduced in PCOS rat ovaries. The\nhuman ortholog of mouse AKR1B7 is AKR1B10, which shares 89% amino\nacid homology with the mouse AKR1B7. 33 It\nwould be interesting to explore whether human AKR1B10 is involved\nin the pathogenesis of PCOS, such as menstrual cycle disturbance,\nand whether it may serve as a therapeutic target for orlistat in the\ntreatment of PCOS.  Previous proteomics studies have demonstrated\nthat DEPs in PCOS\novaries are involved in the immune response and low-grade chronic\ninflammation, which is a key contributor to the PCOS pathogenesis\nand affects the occurrence of IR and ovarian dysfunction. 38 Inflammation may also affect important physiological\nprocesses that ultimately lead to infertility in PCOS patients. 39 In the current study, according to the GO enrichment\nanalysis, the ORL-PCOS vs PCOS group had a lower abundance of proteins\ninvolved in the regulation of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathways,\nsuch as lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). LBP, one of the\nmost important ligands of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), transfers LPS\nto the LPS receptor, ultimately resulting in the activation of TLR4\nand inflammatory pathways. 40 In addition,\nserum LBP levels are positively correlated with several metabolic\ndisorders, including obesity, IR, and T2DM. 41 Studies have also indicated the potentially important roles of LBP\nin the pathogenesis of PCOS. For example, Banaszewska et al. revealed\nthat serum LBP levels were significantly elevated in PCOS women compared\nto healthy controls and were positively correlated with free testosterone\nand total cholesterol. 42 Similarly, Zhu\net al. also found that serum LBP levels were significantly increased\nand associated with IR in women with PCOS. 40 Additionally, it was demonstrated that orlistat treatment decreased\nthe plasma LBP level by 16.9% compared with that in high-fat- and\nhigh-cholesterol-induced obese hamsters, and significantly suppressed\nthe increase in IL-6 and CD14 in hamsters. 43 Consistent with previous findings, the ovarian LBP levels were upregulated\n(1.57-fold) in PCOS rats and downregulated (0.77-fold) after orlistat\nintervention, suggesting that orlistat might attenuate the low-grade\nchronic inflammation state of PCOS by reducing LBP expression.    4  Conclusions  This study provides a comprehensive\nanalysis\nof the differentially\nexpressed ovarian proteins in the PCOS vs CON group and the ORL-PCOS\nvs PCOS group employing TMT-based quantitative proteomics. Orlistat\nmay restore the PCOS-associated disorders in linoleic acid and arachidonic\nacid metabolism, and galactose and glycerolipid metabolism, as well\nas improve the chronic inflammation state of PCOS rats. PLA2G4, PLA2G2A,\nPLAAT3, AKR1B7, and LBP may be correlated with the pathogenesis of\nPCOS and may be used as therapeutic targets of orlistat in the treatment\nof PCOS. Despite the above significant achievement, this study does\nhave several limitations, such as the limited sample size and lack\nof detailed validations. Further study is warranted to explore fully\nthe clinical implication of the experimental results from this report    5  Materials and Methods  This study was\nperformed in accordance\nwith the ethical standards\nspecified in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Medical Ethics Committee\nof Lunan Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. approved all procedures (Permit\nNo. AN-IACUC-2021-067).   5.1  Animals  Thirty-five\nspecific pathogen-free\nfemale rats (5\u20136 weeks, 145\u2013165 g, Animal Qualification\nCertificate No. 370726211100731686) were purchased from Beijing Vital\nRiver Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Certificate No. SCXK,\n2016-0006; Beijing, China). Before the experiment, all of the rats\nwere fed adaptively and quarantined for 2 weeks. Rats were housed\nin a breeding room under standard conditions (20\u201326 \u00b0C,\n40\u201370% relative humidity, centralized ventilation of central\nair conditioner \u226515 times per hour, 12 h dark/light cycle).\nDuring the experiment, 10 rats were randomly selected as a control\ngroup (CON) and were fed a high-fat diet with 45% of kcal from fat\n(OpenSource Diets Research Diets #D12451). The other 25 rats were\nfree to drink water and fed with a high-fat diet with 45% of kcal\nfrom fat combined with letrozole (1 mg/kg/day, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical\nCo., Ltd; Jiangsu, China) for 28 days to generate a PCOS model. 37 Vaginal epithelial cell smears were taken daily\nfor 10 consecutive days to analyze the estrous cycle stage. The selection\ncriteria for successfully inducing PCOS rats were referred to that\nof Kafali et al. 15 Twenty-three of 25 rats\nwere identified as successfully induced PCOS rats. Then, 20 letrozole\nsuccessfully induced PCOS rats were randomly selected and divided\ninto two groups ( n = 10/group). Ten rats were randomly\nselected as a PCOS control group (PCOS). The remaining 10 rats were\nthen additionally supplemented with orlistat (80 mg/kg/day, Lunan\nPharmaceutical Group Corporation; Shandong, Linyi, China) for the\nnext 8 weeks. The dose of orlistat was selected based on a previous\nstudy. 44 Letrozole was given throughout\nthe experiment to the PCOS rats. The control group and PCOS group\nwere given the same volume of solvent without orlistat. Orlistat or\nsolvent was administered by oral gavage.    5.2  Sample\nCollection  After orlistat\ntreatment, the rats were weighed every week. Rats in each group were\nfasted for 24 h after the last administration. Blood was taken from\nthe abdominal aorta to sacrifice the rats. Blood samples were collected\nand then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The levels\nof serum sex hormones, including testosterone (T), estradiol (E2),\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH),\nwere tested using radioimmunoassay (Beijing North Institute of Biotechnology\nCo., Ltd. Beijing, China) according to the specifications for each\nkit. The bar plots in this study were generated with GraphPad Prism\n8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0\n(IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY) using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test and are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nAfter exposing the ovarian tissue, the adipose tissue around the ovary\nwas carefully removed. Then, the ovaries were collected in sterile\nplastic tubes and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for subsequent analyses.    5.3  Trypsin Digestion and TMT Labeling  Tissue\nproteins were extracted and digested as previously described. 45 Briefly, frozen tissue samples were weighed\n(100 mg/mL lysis buffer) and thawed on ice. The samples were resuspended\nin lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS;\npH 8.5) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspensions were sonicated\non ice for five cycles consisting of 10 s bursts with a 30 s pause.\nThe lysates were then centrifuged at 12\u202f000 g for 30 min, and\nthe supernatant was filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm filters. The filtrate\nwas determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad) according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Three or four randomly\nselected ovarian tissue samples were pooled in each group. Protein\ndigestion was performed according to the filter-aided sample preparation\n(FASP) procedure. Briefly, 200 \u03bcg of proteins for each sample\nwas incorporated into 30 \u03bcL of DT buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM DTT,\n150 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). Detergent, DTT, and other low-molecular-weight\ncomponents were removed by repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon units,\n10 kD) using UA buffer (8 M urea, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Then,\n100 \u03bcL of iodoacetamide (100 mM IAA in UA buffer) was added\nto block the reduced cysteine residues, and the samples were incubated\nin the dark for 30 min. The filters were washed with 100 \u03bcL\nof UA buffer three times and then 100 \u03bcL of 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer twice. Finally, the protein suspensions were\ndigested with 4 \u03bcg of trypsin (Promega) in 40 \u03bcL of 25\nmM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The\ndigested peptides of each sample were desalted on C18 Cartridges (Empore\nSPE Cartridges C18 (standard density), bed I.D. 7 mm, volume 3 mL,\nSigma), concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in\n40 \u03bcL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. A 100 \u03bcg peptide mixture\nof each sample was labeled using TMT reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Thermo Scientific). Labeled peptides were then fractionated\nby a high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo Scientific).\nThe dried peptide mixture was reconstituted and acidified with 0.1%\nTFA solution and loaded into an equilibrated, high-pH, reversed-phase\nfractionation spin column. Peptides were combined with hydrophobic\nresin under aqueous conditions and desalted by washing the column\nwith water and low-speed centrifugation. A step gradient of increasing\nacetonitrile concentrations in a volatile high-pH elution solution\nwas then applied to the columns to elute the bound peptides into 10\ndifferent fractions collected by centrifugation. The collected fractions\nwere desalted on C18 Cartridges (Empore SPE Cartridges C18 (standard\ndensity), bed I.D. 7 mm, volume 3 mL, Sigma) and concentrated by vacuum\ncentrifugation.    5.4  LC-MS/MS Analysis  LC-MS/MS analysis\nwas performed using an EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nSan Jose, CA) coupled with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo\nFisher). The peptides were loaded onto a reversed-phase trap column\n(Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 cm, nanoViper\nC18) connected to the C18 reversed-phase analytical column (Thermo\nScientific Easy Column, 10 cm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm, 3 \u03bcm) in buffer\nA (0.1% formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer\nB (84% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min\ncontrolled by IntelliFlow technology. The mass spectrometer was operated\nin positive-ion mode. MS data were acquired using a data-dependent\ntop 10 method dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions\nfrom the survey scan (300\u20131800 m/z ) for HCD\nfragmentation. The automatic gain control (AGC) target value was 3\n\u00d7 10 6 , and the maximum ion injection time was 10 ms.\nThe dynamic exclusion duration was 40.0 s. Survey scans were acquired\nat a resolution of 70\u202f000 at m/z 200, the\nresolution for HCD spectra was set to 17\u202f500 at m/z 200, and the isolation width was 2 m / z . The normalized collision energy was 30 eV, and the underfill ratio,\nwhich specifies the minimum percentage of the target value likely\nto be reached at maximum fill time, was defined as 0.1%. The instrument\nwas run with peptide recognition mode enabled.    5.5  Database\nSearch  The resulting spectra\nfrom each run were searched separately against Ensemble_Rattus_ 2 0210609 using the MASCOT engine (Matrix Science,\nLondon, U.K.; version 2.2) embedded into Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software\nfor identification and quantitation analysis. The search parameters\nwere set as follows: the mass tolerance for precursor ions was 20\nppm, and the mass tolerance for product ions was 0.1 Da. A maximum\nof 2 mis-cleavage sites was allowed. The identified PSMs and proteins\nwere retained and analyzed with an FDR of no more than 1.0%. The protein\nratios are calculated as the median of only unique peptides of the\nprotein. All peptide ratios were normalized by the median protein\nratio. The median protein ratio should be 1 after normalization.    5.6  Bioinformatic Analysis of Proteins and DEPs   5.6.1  Enrichment of Gene Ontology Analysis  Proteins were\nclassified by GO annotation into three categories,\nnamely, biological process, cellular compartment, and molecular function.\nFor each category, a two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was employed\nto test the enrichment of the differentially expressed protein against\nall identified proteins. GO terms with a corrected p value <0.05 were considered significant. 47    5.6.2  Enrichment of Pathway Analysis  The Kyoto\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used\nto identify enriched pathways by a two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact\ntest to test the enrichment of the differentially expressed protein\nagainst all identified proteins. The pathways with a corrected p value <0.05 were considered significant. These pathways\nwere classified into hierarchical categories according to the KEGG\nwebsite. 46 The probable protein\u2013protein\ninteractions were predicted using the STRING-db server. 47",
