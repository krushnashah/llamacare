With the continuous development and research of animal models, tissue-specific roles of both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have been demonstrated in animals, which enable people to have a deeper understanding of the potential role of ER in regulating female reproductive diseases.

    "body": "Introduction  In the female reproductive system, there are two major components, the uterus, which is used for pregnancy, and the ovary, which generates ova. Ovaries are the central organ of female reproduction, providing hormones such as testosterone, inhibin, progesterone, and estrogen, which play crucial roles in menstrual cycle regulation and maintenance of fertility ( 1 ). Hormones produced by the ovaries also cause periodic changes in the endometrium, the period of endometrium proliferation corresponding to the follicular phase of the ovary and forms the basis for a successful pregnancy. In particular, estrogen is an important class of steroid hormones that include estrone (E1), estradiol (E2 or 17\u03b2-estradiol), and estriol (E3) ( 2 ), of which E2 is the most abundant and active estrogen. Estrogen exerts a critical influence on female reproduction via the two principal estrogen receptors (ERs), ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2.  Deficient endogenous estrogen production can result in functional reproductive disorders in women, which profoundly influence infertility. Common diseases in women (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer) are associated with aberrant estrogen-mediated functions and the expression of corresponding ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. A better understanding of the mechanism has been achieved through extensive studies of ERs. Nevertheless, further analyses to reach convincing conclusions and determining efficient precautions remain necessary. This review will focus on the physiological roles of the estrogen and ERs in regulating ovary and current major medications used to stimulate ovarian function.    Estrogen and ERs Expression Profile in the Ovary   Estrogen Synthesis  Estrogen plays a fundamental role in the development and normal physiological function of the human female reproductive tract, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Before puberty, only low concentrations of endogenous estrogen is present in girls; the onset of puberty occurs along with an increased level of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( 3 ). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone triggers the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland; subsequently, LH and FSH cause the ovarian follicle to generate large quantities of estrogen. In females, estrogen is produced by locally expressed p450 aromatase from follicular androgens in the ovary and other estrogen-responsive tissues (  Figure\u00a01  ). Specifically, three major forms of endogenous estrogen with estrogenic hormonal activity are present in women: E1, E2, and E3. In pre-menopausal women, E1 and E2 are primarily synthesized in and secreted from the ovarian follicle. E2 is the most potent and prevalent estrone steroid (70-500\u03bcg daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle); accordingly, E2 is the major product of the overall estrogen biosynthesis process. In post-menopausal women, E1 becomes the most prevalent endogenous estrogen; it is produced by conversion of androstenedione (secreted by the adrenal cortex) to E1 by peripheral tissues ( 4 ). E3 is produced in large quantities by the placenta during pregnancy; it is formed from E1 through 16\u03b1-hydroxylation ( 5 ). The process of differentiation during the embryonic and prenatal period, as well as the maturation of these tissues during puberty, determines fertility in females.   Figure\u00a01   Folliculogenesis and follicular estrogen synthesis. (A) Estrogen biosynthesis in ovarian follicles is known as the \u2018two-cell-two-gonadotropin system\u2019 because both cells (granulosa and theca cells) and gonadotropins (FSH and LH) are indispensable for the generation of estrogen in ovarian follicles. Follicles are mainly composed of oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells. Folliculogenesis develops from primordial, primary, secondary follicles and preovulatory follicles before ovulation occurs. After ovulation, the corpus luteum activity was restored. (B) Synthesis of estrogen. In theca cells, LH stimulation produces androstenedione and testosterone. In granulosa cells, testosterone is converted by P450aromatase into estradiol. LH, Luteinizing Hormone; FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; AKR1C3, aldo-keto reductase 1C3; 17\u03b2-HSD, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.     Although circulating estrogen exists in a dynamic equilibrium with metabolic interconversions, E2 is the principal intracellular human estrogen because its potency is substantially greater than that of its metabolites, E1 and E3, at the receptor level ( 6 ). It is well known that in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle when concentrations of E2 reach a persistently high critical concentration (\u2265 200pg/mL), a dramatic shift occurs in E2 action, such that feedback changes from negative to positive at both pituitary and hypothalamic levels; after the shift, E2 becomes a positive inducer of the anterior pituitary and triggers it to release more FSH and LH. These increased levels of FSH and LH stimulate ovarian follicles to produce more E2 ( 7 \u2013 9 ). Following ovulation, E2 concentrations temporarily decrease, but are restored by corpus luteum activity (  Figure\u00a01  ).    ERs Gene, Protein, and Expression in the Ovary  The levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 expression in different tissues varied greatly. In rats, ER\u03b1 mRNA is mainly expressed in predominant in the uterus, mammary gland, testis, pituitary, adipose tissue, kidney and skeletal muscle, while ER\u03b2 mRNA is dominant in the ovary, prostate, lung, cardiovascular and central nervous systems ( 10 \u2013 12 ). For example, the most obvious is that ER\u03b2/ER\u03b1 in the ovary is much higher than in uterus ( 11 ). In human tissues, ERs have two isoforms, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. ER\u03b1 is encoded by ESR1 gene on chromosome 6q25.1 while ER\u03b2 is encoded by ESR2 on chromosome 14q23.2 ( 13 , 14 ). Northern blot analysis revealed that ER\u03b2 transcripts were detected in human testis, thymus, spleen and ovary ( 14 ). ER\u03b1 mainly participates E2 signaling in the uterus, mammary glands, pituitary, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and bone ( 15 , 16 ).  Furthermore, with the development of research, several discrepancies in ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are gradually prominent, even in the same tissue, the expressions of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 positions are also different. In the rat ovary, ER\u03b2 is detectable in granulosa cells of maturing follicles; conversely, ER\u03b1 is more abundant in the interstitium and theca cells ( 17 , 18 ). ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are differentially expressed in human bone, prostate and breast tissue ( 15 , 19 , 20 ). Both normal and neoplastic human tissues and cell lines express detectable ER\u03b2 mRNA ( 21 \u2013 23 ).  The data of ER expression location in the ovary is obtained by in situ hybridization of premenopausal female reproductive tissue (  Table\u00a01  ). In the human ovary, immunohistochemical studies have shown that ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are differentially expressed in granulosa cells that develop follicles. ER\u03b2 immunoreactivity is found in granulosa cells of growing follicles at all stages from primary to mature follicles, and also in some interstitial gland cells ( 15 , 29 ). ER\u03b1 predominantly occurs in the thecal, interstitial gland and germinal epithelium cells. Before the discovery of ER\u03b2, ER was described in 1993 in the ampullary and fimbrial sections of the fallopian tube ( 30 , 31 ). The present observations suggest that estrogen stimulates the proliferation of granulosa cells in small follicles, enhance the sensitivity of granulosa cells to FSH and LH, and modulate the biosynthesis of progestins and cAMP ( 32 ). Several studies have also reported GPER mRNA and protein is localized on the ovary ( 27 , 28 ). However, the exact role and mechanism of estrogen in human ovaries remain to be elucidated.

Mechanism of ERs Action in the Ovary  Estrogen is produced in the ovaries and is present in highest concentrations in this organ. In theory, it continuously saturates and activates homologous receptors and could lead to continuous transcriptional activation. Estrogen signaling pathways are mainly mediated by ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 which located at different chromosomal locations. At the cellular level, they function synergistically or antagonistically, therefore the final cellular outcome will be determined by their cumulative interaction of activation and/or inhibition pathways ( 33 ). Numerous mRNA splice variants exist for both receptors in both normal and diseased tissues ( 34 ). ER consists of six components: an amino-terminal domain (A/B domain), a DNA-binding domain (DBD; C domain), a hinge region (D domain), a ligand-binding domain (LBD; E domain), and a carboxy-terminal domain (F domain) ( 35 ). ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 share similar structures and they form homodimers (ER\u03b1\u03b1/ER\u03b2\u03b2) or heterodimers (ER\u03b1\u03b2) upon estrogen binding ( 36 ). The amino-terminal A/B domains of ER\u03b1 have ligand-independent AF-1, while the LBD includes the ligand-dependent AF-2 which is significant in ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation ( 37 ). In contrast, ER\u03b2 displays a lower affinity for ERE binding and considerably lower transcriptional activity in the E2-induced ERE-dependent genomic signaling pathway.  ER-mediated genomic pathway can be subdivided into ERE-dependent and ERE-independent subtypes, and both processes typically occur within hours ( 34 ). In the \u201cclassical\u201d mechanism of estrogen action, the nuclear ER-estrogen complex directly binds to a specific DNA sequence called the estrogen responsive element (ERE) in the promoter regions of estrogen-responsive genes, then regulates the transcription of these genes ( 38 ). Alternatively, the nuclear ER-estrogen complex can bind to ERE sequences indirectly through protein-protein interactions with transcription factors, like activator protein 1 (AP-1) or specificity protein 1 (SP-1) that occur in the promoter regions of ERE sequences. These interactions result in the recruitment of co-regulatory proteins (co-activators or co-repressors) to the promoter, changes in mRNA levels, and the production of proteins that are associated with physiological responses ( 39 \u2013 42 ).  Furthermore, ER\u03b1 was found to be association with the cell membrane, allowing for rapid \u2018non-genomic\u2019 estrogen signaling. The non-genomic pathway typically involves cytoplasmic proteins, growth factors, and other membrane-initiated signaling pathways ( 43 \u2013 45 ). Alternatively, in addition to hormone-mediated activation, it is now well accepted that ER function can be modulated by extracellular signals in the absence of E2. Polypeptide growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), activate ER and increase the expression of ER target genes in an estrogen-independent manner ( 46 ). Although the molecular mechanisms involved in ligand independent ER activation have been characterized, the biological role of these processes requires further understanding.  GPER is a novel membrane estrogen receptor responsible for rapid non-genomic estrogen response and transcriptional regulation that activates numerous signal transduction pathways. A study demonstrated that ER\u03b1 is one of the transcription factors downstream of GPER, suggesting the interaction between non-genomic and genomic estrogen receptors ( 47 ).    The Role of ERs: Evidence From Animal Models  The ERKO mice are an optimal biological model to the research work for understanding the physiological action and mechanisms of estrogen action (  Table\u00a02  ). Estrogen via ERs is essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. As evidenced by the \u03b1ERKO mouse model, adult \u03b1ERKO female mice are infertile due to hypoplastic uteri and hyperemic ovaries without corpora ( 48 , 49 ). In wild-type rodents, the primary site of estrogen feedback is hypothalamus, where \u03b1ERKO females cause increased hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, which then manifests as hypergonadotropism, resulting in ovarian cyst formation. Female mice with \u03b1ERKO have elevated plasma estradiol and androstendione levels, as well as elevated testosterone levels. In addition, an obvious endocrine sex reversal observed in \u03b1ERKO/\u03b1\u03b2ERKO ovaries, characterized by ectopic expression of HSD17\u03b23, as this enzyme is unique to the testes ( 48 , 50 ).

ENERKI mice are a mutation converts glycine to leucine at residues 525 (G525L) in LBD of ER\u03b1, lacking ER\u03b1 interaction and response with endogenous estrogen. The phenotypes of ENERKI mice and \u03b1ERKO mice are similar. The mammary gland ductal trees of ENERKI mice are rudimentary, with no terminal end bud formation, ductal elongation, branching, or alveolar differentiation ( 51 ). ENERKI mice were infertile due to being unable to ovulate normally and had hypoplastic uterine tissues. Phenotypical evaluation of the ENERKI mice has also established that ER\u03b1 ligand-induced, but not ligand-independent, signaling is critical in female mammary gland and reproductive tract development. Furthermore, ENERKI mice have elevated LH levels, cystic ovaries and high androgen secretion, reminiscent of human polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 52 , 53 ). And ENERKI females\u2019 granulosa cells are disordered and not encapsulated in follicular structures, similar to certain types of ovarian granulosa cell tumors.  Female mice lacking ER\u03b2 are normally fertile and show normal sexual behavior, but in a continuous mating study, they have reduced litter numbers and sizes compared with wild-type mice ( 54 ). This decrease in fertility is the result of impaired follicular maturation and a decrease in the number of follicles responsive to LH. There are fewer corpora lutea in the ovaries of \u03b2ERKO mice than WT ovary after superovulation, indicating that some follicles failed to rupture and discharge oocytes during the ovulatory hCG surge. ER\u03b2 mediates the stimulating effect of estrogen on granulosa cell proliferation and \u03b2ERKO mice have an inefficient and rare ovulation response ( 55 ). Granulosa cells of \u03b2ERKO ovaries exhibited an attenuated response to FSH-induced differentiation after PMSG treatment, which is reflected in the insufficient expression of LH receptors, decreased aromatase activity and reduced estradiol synthesis, accompanied by incomplete expansion of the cumulus-oocyte complex ( 56 ). The female mice with ER\u03b2 mutations have normal mammary histology and lactate effectively. These studies might help to determine that ER\u03b2 is essential for expelling healthy oocytes but not essential for female sexual differentiation, fertility, or lactation.  Briefly, \u03b1ERKO and \u03b2ERKO female mice have an appropriate development female reproductive tract ( 57 ). However, lacking sensitivity to estrogen severely affects sexual maturation of the entire reproductive tract in the \u03b1ERKO female and ovarian function in \u03b2ERKO female. Mice lacking ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 exhibit a phenotype similar to \u03b1ERKO mice, as female mice are infertile ( 58 ). Further investigation is required to determine whether there are potential compensatory and synergistic effects between ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2.  There are two known forms of nuclear ER, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, in the tissues of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Serum sex hormone levels are strictly regulated by the HPG axis and are associated with follicular growth in the ovaries. The symptoms of female reproductive disease PCOS may result from a disturbance of feedback regulation system of the HPG axis. The regulation of the GnRH neuronal network by E2 involves both negative and positive feedback effects, which together are responsible for producing the ovarian cycle in adult women ( 59 ). Estrogen regulates GnRH neurons to control ovulation in mammals. As GnRH neurons do not express ER\u03b1, and the positive feedback of estrogen to GnRH neurons is indirect. Mice harboring a neuron-specific ER\u03b1 deletion was infertile and lacked estrogen positive feedback, and the ER\u03b1-expressing neurons have been found to modulate GnRH neurons located within the periventricular nuclei of the rostral hypothalamus ( 60 ). The study has provided evidence to show that the ovulation is mediated by estrogen actions on ER\u03b1-expressing neuronal afferents to GnRH neurons. Furthermore, ablation of ER\u03b1 from neurons expressing calmodulin kinase II\u03b1 using a tamoxifen-based inducible Cre-LoxP approach displayed that ER\u03b1 is a key receptor responsible for acute negative estrogen feedback in the mouse brain ( 61 ). However, ER\u03b2 is expressed in GnRH neurons. Global ER\u03b2 mutant mice showed normal patterns of estrogen-induced GnRH activation and LH surge secretion. This indicated that ER\u03b2-regulated signaling in GnRH neurons is not important for estrogen positive feedback ( 60 ). Mutant mice with selective deletion of ER\u03b2 and its functional splice variants in GnRH neurons also suggested that ER\u03b2 has no critical role in acute negative feedback in GnRH neurons ( 61 , 62 ).  Both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are expressed in the rat pituitary gland, yet diverse lines of evidence indicate that estrogen-induced pituitary changes are presumably mediated by ER\u03b1 ( 12 , 63 ). Gieske et\u00a0al. produced a ER\u03b1 flox/flox \u03b1GSU cre mice line by deleting ER\u03b1 in pituitary gonadotroph ( 64 ). The basal LH and FSH levels of female pituitary-specific ER\u03b1 knockout mice were not elevated and their ovulation ability was comparable to that in controls, their estrous cycles were irregular and infertile, suggesting that the LH surge is mistimed, attenuated, or absent. Taken together, ER\u03b1 in the pituitary gonadotroph is required for estrous cyclicity and fertility in females. In addition, these findings support that the pituitary is not the primary target of negative estrogen feedback in mice, but rather the hypothalamus, compared to the ER\u03b1 -/- phenotype.  In another study, however, estrogen positive and negative feedback was disrupted in female mice lacking ER\u03b1 in the pituitary gonadotroph (Pit ESR1 KO) ( 65 ). Female Pit ESR1 KO mice were subfertile or infertile, had higher serum LH levels than wild-type, along with a lack of surges in LH values and regular estrous cycles. Some hemorrhagic cystic follicles were also noted in these mice.  Due to the varied phenotypes reported in pituitary-specific ER\u03b1 KO mouse models, Arao et\u00a0al. develop a unique model that reintroduces ER\u03b1 expression exclusively in the pituitary on the background of a global ER\u03b1-null (PitERtgKO) mouse ( 66 ). The findings suggested that serum E2 and LH levels were normalized in PitERtgKO females. While PitERtgKO female mouse caused a more severe cystic and hemorrhagic phenotype than observed in ER\u03b1KO females, implying that anomalous sporadic LH secretion is an important factor to induce severe ovarian phenotype. The results also further suggested that pituitary ER\u03b1 is involved in negative feedback regulation of estrogen and hypothalamus ER\u03b1 is required for precise control of LH secretion ( 66 ).  Wang et\u00a0al. reported that GPER expression in hamster ovaries depends on the estrous cycle, with GPER mRNA and protein abundance in the granulosa and theca cell layers peaking on day 3 of the estrus cycle and decreasing on day 4 ( 67 ). GPER has been shown to regulate the E2-mediated stimulation of primordial follicle formation in the hamster ovary ( 68 ). However, the GPER KO mouse model exhibits normal fertility and reproduction, which may explain the lack of particularly strong effects of GPER on normal reproductive physiology ( 69 ). Due to species differences, reproductive data from rodents may not apply to humans.  ER knock-out models suggest that ER\u03b1 plays an active role in the reproductive system, and ER\u03b2 mediates estrogen stimulation of granulocyte proliferation, which is important during ovulation, and the role of GPER appears to be less significant than that of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. In general, studies using animal models have highlighted the importance of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 signaling in the ovary and the effect of ERs on the gonadal axis on the ovary.    ERs and the Main Pathological Conditions of Ovary  ER is a marker of ovarian disease in the numerous conditions affecting the ovarian functions. Therefore, the mechanism of ER involved in inducing ovarian disease and cancer cell growth should be further studied (  Figure\u00a02  ).   Figure\u00a02   Molecular pathways of ER regulation in ovarian lesions, like PCOS, ovarian cancer and premature ovarian failure (POF). The interaction of estrogen and ER can initiate intracellular signaling cascades leading to downstream activation of MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling, both of which are critical for cell growth and proliferation.

PCOS  PCOS is a state of unbalanced steroid hormone production and activity that affects approximately 4%-18% of women of reproductive age worldwide ( 71 ). The most common phenomena are anovulation (or oligo-ovulation) and endometrial changes, which typically result in female infertility. According to the conclusion of the 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop, the clinical manifestations of PCOS include low or no ovulation, hyperandrogenism, and obesity ( 72 ). Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common characteristics of PCOS. The criteria included a wider range of symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than the previous NIH classification of 1990. And it has been recognized that not all females with the disease have the biochemical and clinical features defined by PCOS, and that some women with the syndrome have regular cycles, or do not have excess androgens, but will show evidence of ovarian dysfunction ( 73 ).  Unlike higher testosterone and lower progesterone levels, estrogen levels in women with PCOS are typically similar to those of healthy women ( 74 ). ER\u03b2 stimulates follicular growth, induces the expression of specific genes, and increases the number of ovulated oocytes. Disruption of the ER\u03b2 gene, therefore, would be expected to have effects on ovarian function and subsequent fertility in the female. In contrast, ER\u03b1 inhibited ovulation, presumably through effects on the HPG axis and uterine growth ( 75 ) (  Figure\u00a02  ). The mechanism of estrogen deficiency or disrupted estrogen synthesis by PCOS remains a longstanding challenge. Upregulation and activation of the WNT2/\u03b2-catenin pathway was reportedly tightly associated with estrogen deficiency in PCOS cumulus cells ( 76 ). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in cumulus cells from patients with PCOS are significantly lower than those from healthy controls ( 75 ), and considerable alterations in the expression levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are also found in theca and granulosa cells ( 77 ); taken together, these findings suggest abnormal folliculogenesis in patients with PCOS.  Interestingly, women with PCOS possess various endometrial abnormalities. Women with PCOS present with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, which results in persistent circulating levels of estrogen, and complex effects on the endometrium, leading to implantation failure and proliferative aberrations ( 78 ). Several endometrial markers associated with the PCOS phenotype have been carried out, explaining some of the adverse endometrium-related clinical manifestations. ER may be the most prominent marker in women with PCOS, as the expression of ER is reportedly increased in the stroma and glandular epithelium of women with PCOS ( 79 \u2013 83 ). Moreover, endometrial ER\u03b1 immunostaining is reportedly higher in the stroma and epithelium of women with PCOS during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle ( 83 , 84 ), but some studies have shown no alterations in ER expression among patients with PCOS ( 81 ). Recent studies have demonstrated that, compared with body mass index-matched controls, proliferative endometrium in women with obesity who have PCOS exhibits lower mRNA levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b136, as well as a lower ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 mRNA ratio ( 85 ). It has been reported that the endometrium from PCOS-like rodents and patients with PCOS is morphologically normal, but exhibits structurally and biochemically abnormal responses to hormone stimulation; uterine E2-regulated glycolysis via ER\u03b1 activation may contribute to successful implantation and the establishment of pregnancy, as E2 is widely regarded as a master regulator of endometrial cell proliferation ( 86 , 87 ). ER\u03b2 -/- mice have defective ovulation reminiscent of PCOS in humans ( 88 ). Studies focused on polymorphisms in ER genes have shown no associations between the polymorphisms Pvu II and Xba I in ER\u03b1 and the presence of PCOS ( 89 ). In contrast, another study reported that ER\u03b1 rs9340799 was associated with susceptibility to PCOS in Pakistani women in a sequencing analysis of DNA samples from 96 patients with genetically unrelated PCOS and 96 controls ( 90 ). Jiao et\u00a0al. found that the GA genotype of rs1999805 in ER\u03b1 increased the risk of PCOS in the Chinese population ( 91 ). Furthermore, a study evaluating polymorphisms in ER\u03b2 gene demonstrated that the ER\u03b2 gene +1730 G/A polymorphism may be associated with pathophysiologic aberrancies observed in patients with PCOS ( 92 ).  A normal endocrine feedback loop between organs of the HPG axis exerts a critical influence on reproductive potential. ERs are necessary for the normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Attenuated E2 negative feedback action by neuronal ER\u03b1 of the mediobasal hypothalamus may lead to GnRH hypersecretion, and thus LH excess, contributing to ovarian hyperandrogenism in PCOS.  There are a number of reports that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a role in the development of PCOS. For example, patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia possess features of PCOS, are characterized by elevated LH levels and ovarian hyperandrogenism ( 93 ). Notably, studies have shown that ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are expressed in the hypothalamus, where they induce GnRH release and upregulate anterior pituitary GnRH receptor expression, thereby promoting the positive regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by estrogen and maintaining normal ovulation ( 94 , 95 ). Considering the direct and indirect effects of estrogen on follicle development, maturation and ovulation mediated by ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, it is expected that polymorphisms in ER\u03b1 and/or ER\u03b2 play a role in the persistent anovulation in PCOS. However, studies on SNPs in estrogen signaling and susceptibility to PCOS have been inconsistent. Zhou et\u00a0al. concluded that no significant association between ER\u03b1 rs2234693, RS9340799, and ER\u03b2 RS4936938 variants and PCOS ( 96 ). But we should note that although no statistical significance was found, the rate of RS2234693 polymorphism in ER\u03b1 in patients with PCOS tended to be higher than in control women.  Studies provide evidence that estrogen may induce its effect on the adrenal gland through receptor-mediated mechanism ( 97 ). Although ovaries are the major source of increased androgens in PCOS, studies have found that the adrenal glands also contribute to hyperandrogenism in the syndrome. Approximately 20-33% of PCOS patients present with an excess of adrenal androgens, which is primarily detected by elevated levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( 98 ). Studies have illustrated that circulating adrenal androgens serve as precursors of ovarian androgens via intraovarian conversion, and that if serum adrenal androgen levels are elevated, it is possible to induce polycystic ovaries functionally and morphologically ( 99 ). In contrast, data indicate that in PCOS, the ovaries promoted adrenal androgen overproduction ( 100 , 101 ). Thus, in PCOS, the ovaries and adrenal glands may be able to interact in a bidirectional manner in addition to the traditional regulation exerted by the hypothalamus and pituitary on either peripheral gland. Nevertheless, the relationship between ERs expression and human PCOS and adrenal gland remains to be further investigated.  Several researches have examined a possible association between GPER and oocyte maturation. For instance, Pang and colleagues treated Atlantic croaker oocytes with E2 and G-1 (GPR30 ligand), indicating GPER maintained oocyte meiotic arrest by activating adenylate cyclase ( 102 ). The high expression GPER mRNA in carp oocytes showed the inhibitory effect of E2 on oocyte maturation ( 103 ). Peyton et\u00a0al. also confirmed this idea in zebrafish experiments ( 104 ). Subsequently, the relationship between GPER and follicular dysplasia was further revealed in recent studies. Zang et\u00a0al. analyzed the differences in GPER expression between patients with PCOS and women without PCOS ( 28 ). The data indicated the GPER mRNA and protein levels of granulosa cells in PCOS patients were higher than those in the control group at the germinal vesicle stage. Therefore, E2 may be involved in inhibiting oocyte meiosis through GPER. This results in abnormalities oocyte maturation, increased follicular density and augmented androgen synthesis, which is a confluence of factors that induce PCOS.    Ovarian Cancer  Among gynecological malignancies, epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecological cancer death and it is the seventh most common female cancer in the world ( 105 ). Every year around the world, 230000 women will be diagnosed and 150000 will die ( 106 ). Although many efforts have been made to elucidate the etiology of ovarian cancer and the molecular mechanisms involved in ovarian cell proliferation, the disease remains poorly understood.  The expression levels of ER\u03b1 are implicated in estrogen-dependent proliferation, invasion and response to endocrine therapy in ovarian cancer ( 107 ). ER\u03b1 is a direct target of the tumor suppressor microRNA (miR)-206, and the introduction of miR-206 mimics inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of ER\u03b1-positive ovarian cancer cell lines, CAOV-3 and BG-1 ( 108 ). The effects of E2 on cancer progression can be mediated by coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Studies have indicated that three long non-coding RNAs (TC0100223, TC0101686 and TC0101441) are abnormally expressed in ER\u03b1-positive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues, suggesting that they may have potential for cancer progression ( 109 ). And TC0101441 is considered to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival ( 109 ). In vitro studies have used cDNA microarrays to confirm changes in gene expression in E2-treated PEO1 cells (an ER-positive, estrogen-responsive ovarian cancer cell line); the activation of ER\u03b1-mediated transcription was shown to be responsible for the observed changes in gene expression, as well as the estrogen-driven growth of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, whereas ER\u03b2 played no meaningful role ( 110 ).  The level of ER\u03b1 mRNA in malignant tumors is higher than that in benign tumors, while ER\u03b2 mRNA in benign is higher than in malignant tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that ER\u03b2 may have the opposing effects on ovarian cancer. ER\u03b2 levels and/or the ER\u03b2/ER\u03b1 ratio decrease along with the development of ovarian cancer, indicating that loss of ER\u03b2 expression affects carcinogenesis. Treatment with the ER\u03b2 agonist DPN or re-introduction of ER\u03b2 results in notably slower cell growth in both ovarian cell lines SKOV3 and OV2008, and xenografts ( 111 , 112 ). ER\u03b2 decreased the frequency of S phase cells and increased the cells in G2/M phase cells. At the molecular level, the inhibitory effects of ER\u03b2 are mediated via the low expression levels of total retinoblastoma (Rb), phosphorylated Rb and phospho-AKT cellular content as well as cyclins D1 and A2, accompanied by a more than 10-fold increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (WAF1) transcript levels and upregulation fibulin 1c ( 112 , 113 ). In addition, part of the anti-proliferative action of ER\u03b2 can be explained the direct effect of ER\u03b2 on ER\u03b1 by strongly inhibiting its expression and activity.  In the normal ovary, the levels of ER\u03b2 are high, being ER\u03b21, ER\u03b22, and ER\u03b25 the most represented isoforms ( 114 ). Different ER\u03b2 isoforms may have different roles. Patients with cytoplasmic ER\u03b22 expression have markedly worse, the 5-year survival rate of patients with serous ovarian cancer expressing cytoplasmic ER\u03b22 was 32% lower than that of negative patients ( 115 ). Cytoplasmic ER\u03b22 expression was also reported to be associated with chemoresistance. These findings suggested that the sudden diminish in ovarian estrogen might, confer a more aggressive phenotype by the modulation of ER\u03b22 status, and ultimately contribute to ovarian cancer development.  GPER mRNA is expressed in both benign and malignant ovarian tumors, but GPER mRNA is overexpressed in one-third of malignant tumors ( 116 ). GPER is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the biopsy tissues of serous and mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma. GPER is also expressed in certain cell lines, such as SKOV-3, OVCAR-3, and OVCAR5, and is abundantly co-expressed with ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in the SKOV3 cell line ( 117 , 118 ). GPER regulates the expression of c-fos and cyclin D1 proteins as well as cancer cell invasion and metastasis factors. In ER\u03b1-positive BG-1 ovarian cancer cells, GPER mediated growth response to estrogen and G-1 through activation of the EGFR pathway ( 119 ). Atrazine is one of the most common pesticide contaminants in groundwater and surface water ( 120 , 121 ). In ovarian cancer, atrazine stimulates the expression of multiple estrogen target genes and the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells through the participation of GPER and ER\u03b1 ( 122 ). On cursory consideration, the role of GPER in ovarian cancer may require the co-expression of ER\u03b1. On the opposite hand, it has been reported that GPER stimulation in the opposite way, inhibiting the development of cancer. G-1 is a selective GPER agonist that can inhibit the G2/M cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis to control the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells ( 117 ).    POF  POF is a heterogeneous condition clinically defined as cessation of ovarian function, with elevated gonadotropins and low estrogen levels under the age of 40 years, presenting approximately 1% of women of reproductive age ( 123 , 124 ). Recently, the term primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) has been proposed to scientifically describe the state of ovarian function ( 125 ). It is characterized by the occurrence of primary or secondary amenorrhea ( 126 ). Although it has an iatrogenic or spontaneous etiology, to date, there is no effective treatment to restore ovulation function. However, underlying genetic abnormalities may still be associated with POF, and sequence variations in genes involved in estrogen metabolism may lead to ovarian dysfunction. Given that initial follicular pool size and follicular recruitment rates are associated with age at menopause, genetic variants in sex hormone receptor genes can be considered important risk factors to POF development.  The results related to the distribution of ER\u03b1 Pvu II and Xba I genotypes in patients with POF are contradictory. Bretherick et\u00a0al. have uncovered in fifty-five POF patients, compared with 107 women from the general population, and 27 women who had proven fertility after age 37, an association between the polymorphic C allele of Pvu II polymorphism in ER\u03b1 gene and secondary POF risk ( 127 ). In keeping with this result, recently, M\u2019Rabet et\u00a0al. found a positive association of the CC-allele of the Pvu II polymorphic variant in ER\u03b1 gene to women suffering from infertility ( 128 ). Further, Cordts et\u00a0al. associated the presence of the C allele of ER\u03b1 Pvu II polymorphism (rs2234693) with POF in Brazilian population, and none of the ER\u03b2 polymorphisms evaluated were associated with POF ( 129 ). These findings could be due to the decreased of ER\u03b1 transcription and receptors number in the presence of C allele in Pvu II site, which impacts the estrogenic response of tissues, leading to low levels of nuclear transcription factors, allowing apoptotic events with multiple estrogen-responsive target tissues to occur.  Other investigators also have reported the relation of ER\u03b1 genetic variant and POF. The X allele of Xba I and specific haplo- and diplotype of Pvu II and Xba I polymorphisms were associated with a marginally reduced risk of POF occurrence ( 130 ). On the other hand, A study detected ER\u03b1 gene polymorphisms by MGB primer/probe taqman assay from 126 idiopathic POF patients and 221 post-menopausal controls ( 131 ). As is shown in the results, a significantly higher frequency of TT genotypes was observed in the POF patients among the ER\u03b1 Pvu II polymorphisms assessed. When the POF patients were further divided into the primary and the secondary POF groups, secondary POF had a higher prevalence of TT genotype than the control. Indeed, the ER\u03b1 gene polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of idiopathic POF. Overall, ERs could be involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian failure but, to strengthen this hypothesis, more studies are needed to confirm these results.     Drugs Potential for Treating Ovarian Disorders  Estrogen mediate cell proliferation in both normal and malignant cells; therefore, ER antagonists that can inhibit transcription by promoting the binding of co-repressors to the ERE are useful for the prevention of proliferation in malignant tissues. Mixed agonist-antagonists, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, have distinct pharmacological effects on estrogen target tissues ( 132 ). Transcriptional activation of ER\u03b1 is mediated by AF-1 in the N terminal and AF-2 in LBD, which is needed by the binding of ER\u03b1 to cofactors ( 133 ). AF-1 activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of Ser118 through the growth factor signaling pathway, whilst the activity of AF-2 responds to ligand binding ( 134 , 135 ). Agonist binding triggers AF-2 activity, but the binding antagonist does not ( 136 ). Tamoxifen has a weak agonistic activity. This mild agonistic behavior is caused by phosphorylation of serine 305 of ER\u03b1 by protein kinase A (PKA) ( 137 ). By contrast, human ER\u03b2 lacks AF-1 domain activity and is therefore completely dependent on ligand-dependent AF-2 ( 138 ). The major determinant of the weak agonist response to tamoxifen is the AF-1 domain of ER\u03b1 rather than the AF-1 domain of ER\u03b2, which explains the different responses to anti-estrogen tamoxifen ( 139 ). In addition, anti-estrogen raloxifene also can block the action of ER by blocking the interaction of AF-2 with p160 coactivator. These drugs are regarded as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The use of SERM-targeted ER may be an appropriate approach for the treatment of associated endocrine diseases.  Clomiphene citrate (CC) is another SERM which has ER agonist and antagonist properties, acting as an estrogen agonist at low endogenous estrogen concentrations, otherwise primarily as a competitive antagonist of ER ( 140 , 141 ). CC is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the stool with a relatively long half-life of 5\u20137 days ( 142 ). CC is highly effective in promoting ovulation in women with PCOS and is recommended as the most used medication for most anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory infertility. And CC induced ovulation in women with PCOS is accompanied by increased secretion of LH and FSH by the pituitary gland and enhanced estrogen secretion ( 143 ). It is believed that CC affects hypothalamic ER\u03b1 which implies enhanced secretion of hypothalamic GnRH pulses, thereby increasing the pulse frequency of LH to promote ovulation ( 144 ). Although there is some data regarding its potential harmful effects like affecting endometrial thickness ( 145 , 146 ). A randomized multicenter trial comparing CC, metformin, and a combination of two drugs in patients with PCOS found that the conception rate was significantly higher in the clomiphene group than in the metformin group ( 147 ).  Aromatase, also known as CYP19A1, is responsible for the aromatization of androgen to estrogen. Given that aromatase inhibitors significantly reduce systemic estrogen concentrations, researchers have used aromatase inhibitors to induce ovulation by preventing negative feedback of estrogen on FSH ( 148 ). Studies have shown that the aromatase inhibitor letrozole is effective in inducing ovulation and increasing follicle recruitment in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with few side effects ( 149 ). Compared with patients who exhibited progression of ovarian cancer, tumors from stable patients (using CA125 marker criteria of which response is associated with ER expression in a phase II trial of letrozole in ovarian cancer) showed significantly lower expression levels of several estrogen-responsive genes, which were demonstrated to be ER\u03b1-dependent and upregulated by E2 in the PEO4 ovarian cancer cell line; moreover, higher aromatase expression has been observed in stable patients ( 150 , 151 ). Legro et\u00a0al. conducted a trial in which 750 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to receive letrozole or clomiphene according to modified Rotterdam criteria and demonstrated that letrozole was superior to CC in patients with PCOS, resulting in recommendation to switch from CC to letrozole as the first line agent for ovulation induction in this setting ( 152 ).  Oral contraceptives (OCs) are used to treat hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, and irregular menses and of male-pattern alopecia. We should note that adolescents with PCOS may experience distress due to clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenemia. Thus, OC pills could be used as a first line therapy for young women with PCOS who have no reproductive requirements ( 153 ). OCs have been proven to contain low doses of estrogen and progestin which regulate ovulation by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis ( 154 ). The positive effect of OCs in the treatment of PCOS is predominantly attributed to the reduction of LH secretion, inhibition of ovarian and adrenal androgen secretion, which decreases free testosterone levels and increases sex hormone-binding globulins production in the liver ( 155 ).  The effectiveness of PCOS treatment depends on the dose of estrogen in the contraceptive drug. In general, long-term follow-up and treatment with combined OC is required and at least 6 months of OC therapy is needed to detect improvement in hirsutism or acne in women with PCOS ( 156 ). Metformin, an insulin sensitizer, is used to treat PCOS in women with modulated hyperinsulinemia, androgen levels, and menstrual irregularities in women with PCOS ( 157 ). However, OCs and metformin, as well as oral contraceptives alone, were reported to be superior to metformin alone in reducing free testosterone levels ( 158 ). Contraceptive pills can reduce the risk of endometrial cancer in a long lasting period due to the protective effect of progestin, which is present in OCs ( 159 , 160 ). However, some studies have provided evidence that OCs may impair tissue insulin sensitivity and increase the potential risk of thrombosis and metabolic disease ( 154 , 155 ).    Conclusion  Although it has long been suspected that ERs play an important role in in the ovaries, and there is strong evidence that this is the case in many models, the role of estrogen and its receptors in human disease is extraordinarily complex. The co-dependent, redundant, and independent aspects of E2 signaling through both nuclear and membrane-associated ERs are complex and specific to particular cell types, tissues, ligands, and diseases ( 161 ). The relative levels of synthesis of ERs and ER variants can also have profound effects on the dynamic and integrated network of cellular events, both in terms of physiology and pathophysiology, in a tissue-specific manner ( 162 ). Finally, ER signaling depends on coregulators. Thus, distinct post-translational modifications modulate unliganded or liganded ER functions at each level, and can alter ligand pharmacology ( 163 , 164 ). GPER inhibits oocyte meiosis to induce polycystic ovary syndrome, and some studies have also shown that GPER is involved in the occurrence of ovarian cancer, but the effect of GPER on ovaries is not mainstream. We mainly review the dominant role of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in ovarian diseases. The expression levels of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are significantly altered in PCOS and ovarian cancer, and the polymorphism of ER\u03b1 gene is associated with POF.  There is mounting evidence suggesting that changing the ratio of ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 expression may play a key role in tumor development and progression. In fact, pharmacological activated or inhibited of ER\u03b1 and/or ER\u03b2 has provided the basis for treating many diseases. Studies targeting ER\u03b2 and ER\u03b1 provide a method to search for novel specific SERMs. But Long-term estrogen treatment-related adverse events induced by SERM treatment should be closely monitored as well; identifying ideal SERMs that can exert favorable tissue-selective estrogenic agonist activities on target tissues, while remaining neutral with respect to ER and anti-estrogenic activities in the reproductive system, is the future direction of research in this field ( 165 , 166 ). Moreover, in order to better understand the complex regulatory mechanisms of ERs actions in women, it is necessary to build a database of female reproductive diseases. Because most knowledge about the role of ERs in disease has been obtained through animal studies.  In this paper, we discuss animal disease models and the causes of different ovarian diseases that provide insight into the roles of estrogen and its receptor in the female ovary. Also, an overview of available evidence indicating a potential role of ERs as a diagnostic or therapeutic target in reproductive endocrine diseases. In view of these considerations, a better understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms that underlie ER actions is necessary to identify therapeutic approaches that could protect female ovarian health from estrogen, estrogen target tissue malignancies, and diseases associated with estrogen deficiency.
