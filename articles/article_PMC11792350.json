    "abstract": "Despite the documented increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), no specific risk prediction tools are recommended for these patients. We aimed to assess the validity of the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) as a predictor of CVD risk in PCOS patients. In a community-based prospective study, 4,435 women from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort were analyzed. Among them, 215 women aged 30 years or older were diagnosed with PCOS. A Cox proportional hazards model applied to assess the relationship between the FRS and CVD event. Model accuracy was evaluated using the C-statistic, while discrimination and calibration were assessed via the ROC curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistics, and the Hosmer- Lemeshow test. The Cox proportional hazards (HRs) model revealed that the CVD risk increased by 38% for each one-unit increase in the FRS [HR: 1.38 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.66)] in PCOS patients. The FRS had a C-statistic of 0.765, which indicated a satisfactory fit for CVD prediction in this population. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.82, which demonstrated a good discrimination of the FRS. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the predicted probabilities of CVD were consistent with the observed CVD rates ( This study revealed a significant increase in CVD risk among PCOS patients. The FRS effectively predicts a 38% increment in CVD risk for every one-unit increase in the FRS. Our study further validated the FRS as a predictor of CVD risk in these patients.",
    "body": "Background  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health challenge that affects millions of people around the world and imposes a heavy economic burden on health systems [ 1 ]. In 2017, the global mortality rate was 55\u00a0million, with CVD accounting for 32% of the total deaths [ 2 ]. Predicting the 10-year risk of CVD for individuals is a key step in preventing and managing this serious condition, as it can help identify those who require more intensive interventions [ 3 ].  One of the most widely used tools to estimate the 10-year CVD risk is the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), which was developed based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cohort study that started in 1948 and followed thousands of participants for decades. The FRS uses sex- specific algorithms with several risk factors, such as age, total cholesterol (TC), density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), blood pressure (BP), smoking status, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), to calculate the CVD probability. The FRS classifies individuals into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on their CVD risk [ 4 ].  The FRS has been validated as a predictor of CVD risk in various populations, such as general populations [ 4 \u2013 7 ], multi-ethic groups [ 8 ], and patients with endocrine and/or metabolic disorders such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome (Mets) [ 9 , 10 ]. Most of these studies have demonstrated that the FRS can discriminate individuals at risk for developing CVD [ 5 \u2013 9 ], although the FRS may overestimate the CVD risk, especially in certain subgroups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and younger individuals [ 5 , 8 ]. Therefore, the applicability of FRS may differ across diverse populations.  In addition to the traditional risk factors of CVD, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may also increase the CVD risk [ 11 , 12 ]. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with hormonal and metabolic features that may predispose these women to CVD [ 13 \u2013 17 ]. However, the CVD risk, especially in premenopausal women is unclear [ 11 , 18 ]. Recent guidelines advise screening for CVD risk factors in women with PCOS, but they do not recommend any risk prediction tools, due to lack of evidence [ 18 ]. The FRS is a widely used tool to estimate CVD risk but its validity in women with PCOS is uncertain. Few studies have evaluated the FRS in this populations, but they showed inconsistent results [ 19 , 20 ]. For instance, one study found no difference in CVD risk between women with PCOS and controls, despite higher prevalence of some risk factors in PCOS [ 20 ], while another study found that race influenced the CVD risk in PCOS, with black women having higher risk than white women [ 19 ]. However, these studies had cross-sectional or retrospective designs, which have limitations, such as referral and recall biases. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to assess the applicability of FRS in women with PCOS before using it in clinical practice.  To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first community-based prospective study to validate FRS in women with PCOS. The results of this study may provide valuable insights into the applicability and accuracy of FRS for CVD risk prediction in patients with PCOS as a high-risk group.    Methods   Study population  We used data from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), a longitudinal study that started in 1998 to evaluate the risk factors of noncommunicable diseases. The TLGS followed 15,005 people, aged 3 years and older, who resided in a representative district of Tehran (No.13) and were under the coverage of three medical health centers. They were selected using multistage cluster random sampling method. At intervals of every 3 years, comprehensive assessments were conducted, including demographic, anthropometric, reproductive, hormonal, and cardiometabolic characteristics, as well as general physical examinations and laboratory measurements. Detailed methods of the TLGS have been previously described [ 21 , 22 ].  We included all women 30 years and older with PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria [ 23 ]. We used data collected at baseline and six follow-ups. At each follow-up visit, we interviewed the participants and performed a general physical examination, and then collected overnight fasting blood samples for future assessments.  Figure 1 illustrates the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. Out of 4,435 women who participated in TLGS and had a known PCOS status, we excluded those who did not have at least one follow-up visit ( n =\u2009105), those who were younger than 30 years or had an unknown age ( n =\u20092,537), those who did not have PCOS ( n =\u2009993), and those who with a suspicious PCOS diagnosis ( n =\u2009471). Among the remaining 258 PCOS patients who were older than 30 years and had at least one follow-up visit, we further excluded those who had missing data on baseline HDL- C ( n =\u200911), T2D ( n =\u20098), or systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) treatment ( n =\u200924).   Fig. 1 Flow-diagram of the study    Finally, we included 215 women with PCOS in the study. We used the FRS which has validated in 2008 to estimate the baseline CVD risk of the participants based on their age, systolic blood pressure, HDL-C, TC, smoking status, and T2D at baseline [ 4 ]. The FRS assigns a score to each participant according to their risk factors, and categorizes them into low risk (<\u20095%), intermediate risk (5\u201310%), or high risk (\u2265\u200910%).    Clinical and biochemical measurements  A standard questionnaire was used by a trained interviewer to collect data on demographic status, personal and familial history of CVD, medical and medication history, and smoking habits. The methods of measuring some parameters, such as physical activity, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profiles, and the assay techniques have been previously reported. The data on these parameters were obtained as described in those reports [ 24 , 25 ].    Outcome of interest  The primary outcome of this study was CVD, which included any event related to the heart, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cerebrovascular events. The methods of collecting data on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes have been described before [ 22 , 26 ]. In brief, a trained midwife called each participant every year to ask about any medical event, and then a trained physician collected more data about that event by visiting the participant at home and by getting data from medical files. A group of experts, including an internist, an endocrinologist, a cardiologist, an epidemiologist, and others when needed, reviewed the collected data to assign a specific outcome for every event.    Definition of terms  The detail of our study flowchart for assessment of PCOS among TLGS population has been published before [ 21 ]. We used the Rotterdam criteria to diagnose PCOS, which need two or more of these features: irregular or infrequent ovulation, high levels of male hormones and/or hyperandrogenism (HA), and multiple cysts in the ovaries. Women with a history of endocrine disorders, including thyroid disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and androgen-secreting neoplasms, were not included in the study [ 27 ].  Oligo/anovulation was defined as having regular or irregular cycles longer than 34 days or fewer than eight cycles per year. We assessed clinical HA by hirsutism using a modified Ferriman\u2013 Gallwey score (\u2265\u20098), moderate acne, or androgenic alopecia [ 28 \u2013 30 ]. We measured biochemical HA by serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), total testosterone (TT), or androstenedione (A4) above the 95th percentile of healthy non-hirsute eumenorrheic women in the study population (0.89 ng/mL for TT; 2.9 ng/mL for A4; 179\u00a0mg/dL for DHEAS and 5.39 for FAI [ 31 ]. We diagnosed polycystic ovary morphology by the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary with a diameter of 2\u20139\u00a0mm and/or an ovarian volume greater than 10 mL [ 32 ].  We diagnosed CHD by confirmed or probable myocardial infarction based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and biomarkers, unstable angina based on new or changing cardiac symptoms and positive ECG with normal biomarkers, and CHD with angiographic evidence. We defined stroke as definite, possible, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) based on the following criteria: (1) Definite stroke was a rapidly developing clinical sign of focal or global cerebral dysfunction lasting more than 24\u00a0h or leading to death with a vascular origin or imaging evidence of stroke with acute relevant brain injuries in patients with fast resolving symptoms. (2) Possible stroke was an acute focal neurological deficit without imaging confirmation of stroke or not meeting the definite stroke criteria. (3) TIA was a symptom resolution within 24\u00a0h. We included all cases of definite, possible, or TIA in the stroke definition. We considered a positive family history of premature CVD as having diagnosed CVD in first-degree male relatives younger than 55 years or female relatives younger than 65 years [ 22 , 26 , 33 ]. We classified smoking status into ever smokers (current or former) and never smokers. We defined diabetes as fasting plasma glucose\u2009\u2265\u20097 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose (oral glucose tolerance test)\u2009\u2265\u200911.1 mmol/L, or using antidiabetic drugs [ 34 ].    Statistical analysis  Our study has a power of 0.92 for precise prediction of CVD considering a significance level of 0.05, a variance in the Framingham risk score of 11.1, a CVD rate of 0.07, and an assumed Framingham risk score hazard ratio of 1.5 for CVD event.  We compared the baseline characteristics of participants according to FRS groups: low, intermediate and high risk. We expressed the categorical variables as numbers and percentages and compared them by the Chi-squared test or the Fisher exact test (For tables with sparse cells). We checked the normality of continuous variables with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test and applied the appropriate tests for comparison: the mean, SD, and the ANOVA test for normal data, or the median, interquartile range, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normal data.  We applied unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the FRS-CVD association. The event date was the first CVD occurrence. The censored cases were the women without a CVD event by the end of the follow-up. The survival time was the interval from the study entry to the CVD event for the CVD women, and to the last follow-up for the censored women. Additionally, a subgroup Cox regression analysis was conducted based on body mass index (BMI) categories of <\u200927.5\u00a0kg/m\u00b2 and \u2265\u200927.5\u00a0kg/m\u00b2, utilizing the appropriate BMI cutoff point for the Asian population [ 35 ]. We also evaluated the models accuracy using C-statistic. We assessed the model performance by discrimination and calibration. The discrimination was measured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. We plotted the ROC curves once for the original Framingham risk score and once after excluding of those variables were found to be non-significant in predicting CVD in the Cox regression model (HDL-C, SBP, and TC) from components. To statistically assess the difference between the original ROC curve and modified one, we employed the Delong test. The calibration was measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which compared the observed and predicted CVD events.  We performed all analyses using R statistical software version 4.2.2 and considered a 2-tailed p value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant.     Results  The mean (SD) duration of the follow-up period of the study was 18.65 (3.04) years. According to the FRS, 85 (39.5%) women were identified as low risk, 117 (54.4%) as moderate risk, and 13 (6.1%) as high risk (Fig. 1 ).  The characteristics of the study participants at baseline based on the 10-year FRS categories are shown in Table 1 . PCOS women with higher CVD risk, as predicted by the FRS, were older ( p <\u20090.001) and exhibited higher anthropometric measures, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and waist to height ratio (WtHR) ( p <\u20090.001, all), higher prevalence of hypertension, T2D, and metabolic syndrome (Mets) ( p <\u20090.001, all), higher levels of SBP, TG, TC, and LDL-C ( p <\u20090.001 for all except SBP, p <\u20090.014), and lower HDL-C ( p <\u20090.001) than those with lower risk. PCOS patients with higher CVD risk had significantly higher DHEAS levels than those with lower risk ( p =\u20090.039), but no significant difference was observed in other hormonal profiles, such as total testosterone, FAI, and A4. There was no significant difference between the CVD risk groups in terms of their educational level, marital status, menarche age, parity, physical activity, smoking status, and family history of premature CVD.

The FRS had a C-statistic of 0.793, which was acceptable for CVD prediction in this population.

Discussion  This community-based prospective study followed PCOS women for ~\u200920 years and estimated a CVD HR of 1.19, indicating a 19% increase in CVD risk for every one-unit increment in the FRS in adjusted model. We have validated the FRS as a reliable predictor of CVD risk in women with PCOS, demonstrating satisfactory discrimination (C-statistic\u2009=\u20090.765), which is comparable to findings from previous studies conducted on other populations [ 4 \u2013 6 , 8 , 9 , 36 , 37 ]. Our findings confirmed the validation of using the FRS to identify and manage cardio metabolic risk in PCOS women.  The FRS is a sex-specific algorithm that uses different risk factors of CVD to predict the chance of having a CVD event in 10 years. This tool has different versions, but the most widely used one is from 1991 [ 38 ] and the latest one is from 2008. The version 2008 of the FRS considers eight factors based on sex and age, including TC, HDL-C, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, and presence of T2D. The authors evaluated the performance of the general CVD algorithm in predicting the first CVD event among 8491 Framingham study participants without CVD, of whom 4522 were women with an average age of 49 years. The algorithm showed good ability to discriminate (C-statistic of 0.763 for men and 0.793 for women) and calibrate the 10-year CVD risk [ 4 ].  This risk prediction assessment tool has been validated for estimating the CVD risk across diverse populations including the general populations [ 4 \u2013 7 , 39 ], multi-ethic groups [ 8 ], and patients with endocrine and/or metabolic disorders such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome [ 9 , 10 ]. For example, a large nationwide registry of 2,159,616 individuals aged 30\u201379 years compared three CVD risk equations: FRS 1991, FRS 2008, and Pooled Cohort. The FRS 2008 equation had good discrimination (C-statistic: 0.772 for women, 0.759 for men) and calibration, similar to the original study. Women had higher c-statistics than men. The Pooled Cohort equations underestimated the CVD risk, while the FRS equations overestimated it. They recommended recalibrating the equations for high-risk individuals [ 5 ]. A survey of 110 Korean adults with T2DM and metabolic syndrome estimated their 10-year CVD risk using the FRS. The mean risk was 14.55%, and 24% had a high risk (>\u200920%). The FRS had a moderate accuracy (C-statistic: 0.707) in discriminating CVD events (9). The FRS was also applied to 14,863 222 Malaysian participants aged 45\u201365 years with a 4.93-year follow-up. The FRS had a reasonable performance (C-statistic: 0.758) and classified the cardiovascular risk. The FRS also discriminated between survivors and non survivors of CVD (AUC: 0.768) [ 6 ]. Similarly, a cohort study of 3838 people, 2183 women without CVD, used FRS to estimate their CVD and CHD risk over 8.9 years. The FRS had good discrimination (CVD: 0.818 for women, 0.774 for men) and calibration [ 7 ]. The FRS also estimated CVD risk in 1722 women with and 1994 women without major CVD (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death) from a multiethnic cohort. The FRS had acceptable discrimination (C-statistic: 0.750) but overestimated CVD risk in black and white women [ 8 ]. A large population-based longitudinal study of 2700 MetS subjects without CVD estimated their 5- year CVD risk using the FRS and the UKPDS algorithm. The UKPDS algorithm mispredicted risk in different age groups compared to the FRS. There were 133 CVD events over 5.0 years. Both the FRS and the UKPDS algorithm had poor discrimination (0.513 and 0.524) and calibration (467.1 and 297.0) [ 10 ]. These studies demonstrate the variability and uncertainty of the FRS in different populations and settings, and the need for further validation and calibration in specific groups.  Although the FRS has been validated in various populations [ 4 \u2013 10 , 40 ], its applicability in women with PCOS, who have a complex hormonal and metabolic profile that may affect their CVD risk, remains uncertain, as only a few studies have tested it and they yielded conflicting results [ 19 , 20 ]. For instance, a recent cross-sectional estimated the 10-years CVD risk using FRS in 200 middle aged Dutch women with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria, compared to their age-matched controls. It showed calculated 10-year CVD risk was similar in women with PCOS and controls, despite higher prevalence of some CVD risk factors such as obesity and hypertension in women with PCOS. The study also found no significant difference in the prevalence of T2D, metabolic syndrome, and lipid levels between the two groups [ 20 ]. However, the results of this study are limited by its cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causal relationships. Another study was a retrospective study conducted on 519 women with PCOS with data on race and cardiometabolic risk and age and race matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population. They calculated the CVD risk for each race according to FRS. The 10-year general CVD risk score was not significantly different in adolescents, according to race. However, black women with PCOS had a higher 10-year general CVD risk score (2.23% [95% CI 0.24\u201319.98]) than their white counterparts (1.42% [95% CI 0.2\u20138.64]), indicating the effect of race on an increased risk of CVD. However, this investigation is a retrospective study with a cross-sectional approach for the analysis, which has selection bias, as the participants were referral and seeking health care [ 19 ].  After adjustment for potential confounders, we found a significant association between the FRS and CVD outcomes in PCOS women, as the CVD risk increased by 19% for each one-unit increase in the FRS. This risk was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.63) for participants with a BMI\u2009<\u200927.5\u00a0kg/m\u00b2 and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.70) for those with a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200927.5\u00a0kg/m\u00b2. The extent to which CVD risk is modified by an increased BMI independent of FRS have been reported in several studies [ 41 \u2013 43 ]. For instance Mora et al. reported the independent prognostic value of BMI when added to FRS using the multivariable cox proportional hazards analyses. Their study indicated a marked interaction ( p =\u20090.008) between obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m 2 ) and high FRS (>\u200920%), with an adjusted HR compared with low-FRS/normal-weight participants of 14.63 (95% CI, 6.40\u201333.44; p <\u20090.0001) [ 43 ]. Furthermore, another study revealed that a BMI\u2009>\u200945\u00a0kg/m 2 is associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher levels of C-reactive protein, increased waist circumference, and a family history of heart diseases. These factors collectively enhance the risk of developing CVDs, as assessed by the FRS [ 41 ].  The FRS also showed a good performance in predicting CVD events, as it had a good discrimination ability based on ROC curve (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82), a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p =\u20090.217), and an acceptable predictive accuracy (C-statistic\u2009=\u20090.765).  The mechanisms that increase the CVD risk in women with PCOS are complex and not completely understood, and they involve multiple cardiometabolic risk factors [ 44 ]. Women with PCOS have various cardiometabolic risk factors, such as adiposity [ 14 ], high blood pressure [ 13 , 16 ], insulin resistance (IR) [ 45 , 46 ], and abnormal lipid levels [ 17 ]. IR is associated with impaired endothelial function, which puts PCOS women at a higher risk of CVD [ 46 ]. Insulin modulates the function of the vascular endothelium and blood vessels. Insulin can stimulate the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that causes vasodilation and increases blood flow, which in turn enhances glucose uptake by the tissues. Insulin can also regulate the secretion of endothelin-1, a molecule that causes vasoconstriction and reduces blood flow, which in turn impairs glucose metabolism. However, the balance between these two effects of insulin is disrupted in many diseases, such as PCOS, that is characterized by IR and endothelial dysfunction [ 45 , 46 ]. Hypertension in women with PCOS may be linked to IR and hyperinsulinemia, which impair the endothelial function and cause thickening of the vascular wall.  Obesity and IR are key factors that affect blood pressure in PCOS women. The components of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) influence the endothelial dysfunction, which is a marker of cardiovascular damage that could be improved in PCOS women.  Androgens and RAAS components also contribute to the atherogenesis process in PCOS women [ 16 ]. Additionally, women with PCOS have various factors that affect lipid metabolism, such as androgen excess, insulin resistance, estrogen exposure, and environmental factors [ 17 ]. IR causes more lipolysis from fat tissue and dyslipidemia, which damages the pancreatic cells [ 47 ] and increase the risk of T2D [ 48 ]. Hyperinsulinemia also causes vascular inflammation and water retention in the kidney, which raises blood pressure [ 49 ]. Dyslipidemia and high blood pressure worsen the atherosclerosis process and the risk of CVD events [ 50 ]. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and manage the CVD risk factors in women with PCOS, especially those who are obese, hypertensive, dyslipidemic, or insulin resistant. However, despite the presence of multiple CVD risk factors in PCOS women, the evidence for increased CVD events in this population remains inconsistent and inconclusive [ 11 ]. While some studies have shown increased rates of various CVD events in PCOS women [ 12 , 51 , 52 ], others have reported no difference in CVD-related outcomes and mortality [ 20 , 53 ]. This inconsistency may stem from methodological limitations, such as diverse PCOS phenotypes, variable diagnostic criteria, confounding factors, short follow up periods, and low event rates [ 12 , 20 , 51 \u2013 53 ]. Thus, further long-term and large-scale studies are warranted to elucidate the impact of PCOS on CVD morbidity and mortality.  Our study showed an increased risk of CVD in patients with PCOS, as predicted by FRS, which can be explained by the cardiometabolic risk factors that were more prevalent in patients with higher FRS. Compared to women with lower CVD risk, those with higher CVD risk had increased anthropometric measures (BMI, WC, WHR, and WtHR), as well as higher rates of hypertension, T2D, and Mets, and higher levels of SBP, TG, TC, and LDL-C. These results indicate a greater burden of these risk factors and a worse cardiometabolic profile in this group. We also observed that age and SBP were positively associated with CVD risk, with a 14% increase per year of age and a 3% increase per mmHg of SBP, respectively. Diabetic women had a 4.69-fold higher CVD risk than non-diabetic women. However, lipid profiles, another component of FRS, did not influence CVD risk independently.  Our results also revealed that women with higher CVD risk had significantly higher DHEAS levels than those with lower risk, while other hormonal parameters, i.e., TT, FAI, and A4, were similar. This finding suggests a different pattern of association between CVD risk and DHEAS in men and women, which is consistent with previous studies that reported conflicting and paradoxical results [ 54 , 55 ]. For example, a recent meta-analysis of six prospective studies involving 6,744 individuals found that low DHEAS levels were associated with increased CVD risk and mortality only in men, not in women [ 55 ].  The relationship between DHEAS and CVD risk in women is complex and poorly understood.\u00a0DHEAS is a steroid hormone that regulates extraellular matrix organization and cardiac remodeling through a network of proteins and genes [ 56 ]. DHEAS also negatively correlates with histones, which are involved in cellular stress, apoptosis, and tissue injury. DHEAS may influence CVD through atherosclerotic mechanisms, such as reducing vascular cell migration and proliferation and enhancing vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis [ 56 , 57 ]. However, the association between DHEAS and CVD varies by sex and CVD risk factors. For example, higher DHEAS levels are associated with higher total cholesterol in men, but higher glucose in women.  Conversely, higher DHEAS levels are associated with lower TG levels in both sexes. These contradictories and inconsistent obscure the role of DHEAS in CVD risk [ 54 ]. Furthermore, the association between DHEAS and CVD may depend on hormonal milieu, which could partly explain the sex differences in DHEAS and cardiovascular risk factors [ 58 ]. Our study population consisted of patients with PCOS, who have more CVD risk factors than the general population, such as IR and hypertension. We found that T2D and SBP were the main determinants of CVD risk, irrespective of other CVD risk factors, while lipid profiles alone did not predict CVD risk. Further research is warranted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between DHEAS and CVD in women, especially those with PCOS.  The 2023 international guideline for PCOS assessment and management stated that women with PCOS have a higher risk of CVD and its mortality, although the overall CVD risk in premenopausal women is low. They also advised that women with PCOS should be screened for CVD risk factors. However, they did not endorse the use of risk prediction tools due to insufficient evidence [ 18 ]. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the validity and applicability of such tools, especially the FRS, which is widely used to estimate the 10-year risk of CVD, in this specific group.  Our findings can have important clinical implications for the use of FRS in women with PCOS. FRS is a well-established risk predication algorithm that can help clinicians to diagnose CVD risk accurately and timely, and to implement appropriate interventions for women with PCOS. For example, women with PCOS who are classified as high risk by such risk assessment tools may benefit from lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes, to reduce their CVD risk, while high risk women or even those with moderate risk may still require more intensive interventions such as drug therapy as well as continuing lifestyle modifications [ 59 , 60 ], an assumption need to be further confirmed by RCTs. It is, therefore, important to find ways to promote continuous recording of CVD risk factors by health care providers, especially general practitioners to support their preventive care [ 61 ]. Although FRS is a valuable tool to predict CVD risk in women with PCOS, further studies with larger sample sizes and more CVD events are needed to confirm our findings.  This study is the first longitudinal investigation, to our knowledge, to validate FRS in an unselected population of women with PCOS. The long-term follow-up design with several interval visits (every 3 years) is a major strength of the study. Another strength is that we diagnosed PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria, which directly assessed the clinical, hormonal, and sonographic features of the participants. However, some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, our study population consisted of urban Iranian women aged 30 years and older (maximum age of 68 years in the last follow-up), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other age and ethnic groups and other geographic settings. Second, although the number of CVD events was low in our study, the study possesses 92% power for precise prediction of CVD within the overall population. However, we do not have an adequate number of participants to accurately assess the CVD risk in different phenotypes of PCOS. We can reassess the outcomes in the future, as this study is ongoing. Lastly, we could not consider lifestyle factors among patients due to lack of data in this regard.    Conclusion  This study showed that PCOS significantly increases the risk of CVD events over time, as evidenced by the FRS prediction of a 38% increment in CVD risk for every one-unit increase in the FRS score. We confirmed the validity of the FRS as a predictor of CVD risk in PCOS women, with good performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and AUC, consistent with previous studies. Our findings underscore the importance of screening for cardiometabolic risk factors in women with PCOS using reliable risk prediction tools such as the FRS. Moreover, our study emphasizes the need for early and comprehensive management of PCOS, involving lifestyle modification and pharmacological treatment, to lower the CVD risk and enhance the quality of life of women with PCOS.",
