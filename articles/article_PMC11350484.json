This cohort study compared 390 newborns of women with PCOS with 68 708 newborns of women in a reference population. An association was found between maternal PCOS status and growth restriction in the newborn, expressed as low birth weight, shorter birth length, and smaller head circumference.

    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder estimated to affect 8% to 20% of women. 1 , 2 PCOS is associated with poor metabolic health, 3 reduced fertility, and increased risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes (GD), preeclampsia, and preterm birth. 4 Hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, and early mobilization of cytokines with activated immune status are characteristics of PCOS that may influence the intrauterine environment, with a potential impact on fetal growth and offspring health. 5 , 6 While some studies report lower birth weight in children born to women with PCOS compared with controls, 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 others find no association between PCOS and the rates of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) or large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 or find that associations are no longer apparent after adjusting for presumed confounding factors. 16 , 17 , 18 The systematic reviews underpinning the 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome identified a higher risk of low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction among newborns of mothers with PCOS compared with controls. 2 , 19  The primary aim of this study was to further explore the association of maternal PCOS with gestational age\u2013 and sex-adjusted birth anthropometrics by comparing children born to women with PCOS with a large reference population. The secondary aim was 3-fold: to explore the association of maternal PCOS with ponderal index, placenta weight, and birth weight to placenta weight (BWPW) ratio; to assess whether the association of PCOS with these measures was modified by maternal body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared); and to explore whether the presence of hyperandrogenic vs normoandrogenic PCOS phenotypes or GD moderates the association with neonatal anthropometrics.    Methods  This cohort study combines data from 3 clinical trials of pregnant women with PCOS and a reference population consisting of participants in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort (MoBa) Study. Women with PCOS were recruited from October 1, 2000, to August 31, 2017, while women included from the MoBa study were those with children born from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2008. Both studies recruited women in the first half of pregnancy, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The studies were approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. Data were analyzed from January 1 to June 15, 2023. The study was presented in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) reporting guideline for cohort studies.  The PCOS group consisted of participants from the placebo groups of 3 randomized clinical trials comparing metformin treatment with placebo in women with PCOS: the Pilot study (postregistered), 20 the Metformin in Pregnant PCOS Women (PregMet) study ( NCT00159536 ), 21 and the PregMet 2 study ( NCT01587378 ). 22 The Pilot study included 40 women at the University Hospital of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway, of whom 22 were randomized to placebo. The PregMet and PregMet 2 studies were multicenter trials from hospitals in Norway, Sweden, and Iceland and included 274 and 487 pregnancies, respectively, with 138 and 243 randomized to placebo. All participants met the Rotterdam criteria for the PCOS diagnosis. 23 Inclusion criteria were (1) PCOS diagnosis before pregnancy, (2) age between 18 and 45 years, (3) gestational age of 5 to 12 weeks, and (4) singleton viable fetus. We included 390 pregnancies in the present analyses after exclusion of early miscarriage (n\u2009=\u20093), late miscarriage (n\u2009=\u20098), and intrauterine fetal death (n\u2009=\u20092) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 ).  The MoBa Study is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from July 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008. Forty-one percent of the women consented to participate. The cohort included approximately 114\u2009500 children, 95\u2009200 mothers, and 75\u2009200 fathers. The present study was based on version 12 of the quality-assured data files released for research in 2021. The establishment of the MoBa cohort and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval from the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The MoBa cohort is currently regulated by the Norwegian Health Registry Act. The present study was approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway. Material from the MoBa Study was used as reference population, supplemented with data from the MBRN. 24 , 25 , 26  The reference population consisted of 73 758 mother-child dyads. Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) live-born children between 2000 and 2008 and (2) singletons. To match the PCOS population, we excluded mothers 18 years or younger or 45 years or older (n\u2009=\u2009244).  Irregular menstruations were used as a proxy for PCOS, and 4109 women (5.6%) were excluded due to irregular or absent menstruations before pregnancy. Additional exclusions were 176 women due to gestational age of less than 23\u2009plus\u20090 weeks or greater than 42\u2009plus\u20096 weeks; 244 due to z scores for birth weight, birth length, or head circumference being greater than 5 SD over or below the mean, representing unrealistic measurements or extremely ill or affected neonates; and 277 due to unrealistic measurements of placenta weight (<100 g or >1630 g, which were greater than 5 SD over or below the mean). Finally, 68\u2009708 reference pregnancies were analyzed (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 ).   End Points  Primary end points were birth weight, birth length, and head circumference as continuous variables and as z scores. The standard values of Niklasson and Albertsson-Wikland 27 were used for the calculation of z scores, accounting for sex and gestational age of the newborn. Untrimmed placenta weight, ponderal index, and BWPW ratio were secondary end points. Ponderal index was calculated as the birth weight in grams \u00d7 100 divided by the birth length in centimeters cubed. We defined LGA and SGA as z scores greater than or less than 1.28, which correspond to 90th and 10th percentiles, respectively.  Neonatal measurements were performed according to hospital routine and obtained from medical records for the PCOS group and from the MBRN for the reference population. In cases of missing data, parental reports from the MoBa questionnaires were used.    Covariates  We adjusted for the following potential confounding factors in the regression analyses: maternal age, parity, smoking, educational level, civil status, and maternal BMI. The covariates, baseline characteristics, and comorbidities were self-reported in both the PCOS group and reference population, except for parity and maternal BMI. Parity was self-reported in the PCOS group and obtained from the MBRN for the reference population. Maternal BMI for the PCOS group was measured by health care personnel at approximately 11 to 12 weeks of gestation; for the reference population, self-reported prepregnancy and current maternal weight were recorded via questionnaires at 15 weeks of gestation. To account for the difference in timing, the mean between the weights reported at the start of the pregnancy and week 15 was calculated for the reference participants. Maternal ethnicity was self-reported in the PCOS group, from predefined categories as Nordic and other (including African, Hispanic, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, South and East Asian, and other). This information on the participants was important for the possibility to consider generalizability, as well as to consider potential confounding or mediating factors. Birth country for the reference population was self-reported without predefined options. Unrealistic measurements were removed using the following cutoffs: maternal weight of less than 40 kg and greater than 200 kg, maternal height of less than 145 cm and greater than 210 cm, and age at menarche of younger than 8 years and older than 20 years.    Statistical Analysis  Statistical analyses were completed using Stata/MP, version 17 (StataCorp LLC). Maternal baseline characteristics were compared using the 2-tailed t test for continuous variables and \u03c7 2 test for categorical variables. For the primary and secondary end points, crude and multivariable linear regression models were used to compare the newborns of women in the PCOS population with the newborns in the reference population. In model 1, we adjusted for the presumed confounding factors: maternal age, parity, smoking, educational level, and civil status. In model 2, we additionally adjusted for maternal BMI. We opted to include maternal BMI as an additional covariate in a separate analysis since it is unclear to what extent BMI is a consequence of PCOS and thus whether it is a confounder or a mediator of the association between PCOS and birth anthropometrics. In the analysis of placenta weight, ponderal index and BWPW ratio, sex, and gestational age were included as additional confounders in both models 1 and 2. In the analysis of z scores (for birth weight, birth length, and head circumference), sex, and gestational age were accounted for in the calculation of the z score and thus not included as covariates. The results are presented as estimated mean differences (MDs), together with 95% CIs. P <\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant. All tests were 2 sided. Apart from placenta weight, less than 2.5% of children had missing information for any of the neonatal measurements, as these were obtained from medical records or the national birth registry, although some observations were removed from the reference population because of extreme z score values. We have therefore not undertaken any additional analyses to address missing data. Placenta weight was also near complete for the reference group (67\u2009057 of 68\u2009708 [97.6%]); however, data were only available for 335 of 390 (85.9%) in the PCOS group. Nonetheless, we consider this amount missing to be sufficiently low.  In a separate regression analysis, we explored the influence of BMI on the association between PCOS and anthropometric measures by including an interaction term between BMI category and PCOS status. The World Health Organization classification of BMI was used to categorize BMI as underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), and obesity (BMI \u2265 30.0). 28 Participants with BMI of less than 18.5 were excluded due to small sample size.  Subsequently, we investigated potential differences in the neonatal anthropometric measures between subgroups of women with PCOS, including hyperandrogenic vs normoandrogenic PCOS phenotypes and those with and without GD. Both additional analyses were conducted in the PCOS population only, since information on the presence of GD was lacking for most of the women in the reference group. The hyperandrogenic phenotypes of PCOS included participants with both clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, in accordance with the Rotterdam criteria. 23 Screening for GD was universal in the PCOS group. The Norwegian and Canadian criteria were used for GD diagnosis. 29 The cutoff was fasting glucose values of greater than 95.5 mg/dL or 2-hour glucose values of 162.2 mg/dL or higher (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555) during an oral glucose tolerance test. 29     Results  The present study included 390 mothers with PCOS and 68 708 mothers in the reference group. Mothers with PCOS were younger (mean [SD] age, 29.6 [4.2] vs 30.4 [4.5] years), had greater weight (mean [SD], 77.9 [17.5] vs 69.3 [12.3] kg), and shorter height (mean [SD], 167.2 [5.8] vs 168.2 [5.9] cm) than the mothers in the reference group ( Table 1 ). The mean (SD) BMI in the PCOS group was 27.9 (6.4) vs 24.5 (4.1) in the reference group ( P <\u2009.001), with a subsequently higher proportion of women with overweight or obesity. The populations were comparable in terms of age at menarche. The PCOS group had a higher proportion of reported comorbidities. The PCOS group was mainly Nordic (368 [94.4%]; data were not available for the reference group) ( Table 1 ).   Table 1.

Women with PCOS more often had preterm birth and cesarean section, and there was more preeclampsia in the PCOS group, although that result was not significant. Ninety-six women in the PCOS group (24.6%) developed GD ( Table 2 ). Compared with the reference group, children born to women with PCOS had lower birth weight, birth length, and head circumference, both in observed values and corresponding z scores in the unadjusted analyses and adjusted models. In model 1, the estimated MDs in z scores were \u22120.26 (95% CI, \u22120.38 to \u22120.14) for birth weight, \u22120.19 (95% CI, \u22120.33 to \u22120.05) for birth length, and \u22120.13 (95% CI, \u22120.26 to \u22120.01) for head circumference. The estimated differences were greatest in model 2, after additionally adjusting for maternal BMI (MD for birth weight z score, \u22120.39 [95% CI, \u22120.51 to \u22120.27]; MD for birth length z score, \u22120.29 [95% CI, \u22120.44 to \u22120.15]; and MD for head circumference z score, \u22120.25 [95% CI, \u22120.37 to \u22120.12]) ( Table 3 ).

Mean (SD) placenta weight was lower in the PCOS group than the reference population in the unadjusted analysis (MD, \u221220 [95% CI, \u221235 to \u22124]), with a greater difference seen in both models 1 (MD, \u221224 [95% CI, \u221243 to \u22125]) and 2 (MD, \u221241 [95% CI, \u221260 to \u221223]). Ponderal index was similar in the 2 groups (MD, \u22120.04 [95% CI, \u22120.07 to \u22120.004]g \u00d7 100/cm 3 ). The BWPW ratio was higher in the PCOS population (MD, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.5]) ( Table 3 ). A higher proportion of offspring born to women in the reference group were LGA compared with offspring born to women with PCOS (7789 [11.3%; 95% CI, 11.1%-11.6%] vs 29 of 390 [7.4%; 95% CI, 5.2%-10.5%]; P =\u2009.02). More SGA offspring were born to mothers with PCOS than to mothers in the reference group (44 of 390 [11.3%; 95% CI, 8.5%-14.8%] vs 5756 of 68 467 [8.4%; 95% CI, 8.2%-8.6%]; P =\u2009.04) ( Table 2 ).  In all BMI categories, birth weight, birth length, and head circumference were lower in neonates born to women with PCOS compared with women in the reference group, although these differences were not statistically significant for birth length or for head circumference in women with normal weight. The negative association between PCOS and birth anthropometrics was estimated to be progressively greater for children born to women with overweight and obesity; however, the degree of growth restriction was not statistically significantly different across BMI categories ( Table 4 and Figure ). Placenta weight was lower in the PCOS group than in the reference population, with increasing negative difference by increasing BMI category. We found a significant interaction between PCOS status and BMI category for BWPW ratio, with an increasingly greater difference in the groups with higher BMI. The MD was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.0-0.4) in the group with normal weight, 0.4 (95% CI, 0.1-0.6) in the group with overweight, and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.6-1.1) in the group with obesity ( Table 4 ). Among women with PCOS, birth anthropometrics, placenta weight, ponderal index, and BWPW ratio were similar in women with hyperandrogenic versus normoandrogenic PCOS phenotypes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 ), and in those with and without GD (eTable 2 in Supplement 1 ).

Association of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) With Birth Weight, Birth Length, and Head Circumference by Maternal Body Mass Index (BMI)  Model is adjusted for maternal age, smoking, civil status, parity, and educational level. Normal weight is defined as a BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; and obesity, 30.0 or greater. The shaded sections represent mean difference and 95% CI for regression analysis on z score anthropometrics in the PCOS vs reference groups. Dashed line (0) indicates no difference. The degree of growth restriction was not statistically significantly different between BMI subgroups ( P =\u2009.85 for interaction for birth weight, P =\u2009.26 for interaction for birth length, and P =\u2009.38 for interaction for head circumference).       Discussion  To our knowledge, this cohort study of the associations among PCOS status, maternal BMI subgroups, and neonate anthropometrics is unique. The main findings are that offspring of mothers with PCOS have reduced birth weight, birth length, and head circumference compared with the reference population. The growth restriction observed increased with adjustment for BMI (model 2). Placenta weight was lower and BWPW ratio was higher in women with PCOS, indicating a compromised but efficient placenta.  PCOS status was associated with a reduction in all neonatal anthropometric measures, becoming more apparent with increased maternal overweight. With higher maternal BMI, greater gestational weight gain, and more GD in women with PCOS, 4 , 11 , 30 one would expect larger offspring compared with the reference population. Interestingly, previous studies have found the opposite association. 7 , 8 , 9 , 19 In the current analyses, the reduction in birth anthropometrics was most pronounced in model 2, which additionally adjusted for maternal BMI. This indicates an association between PCOS and growth restriction that may be partially camouflaged or counteracted by higher maternal BMI. The growth restrictive mechanism of PCOS appears to be stronger than the anabolic drive by excess maternal weight, higher gestational weight gain, and high incidence of GD otherwise seen in women with PCOS. These findings are in line with and extend the understanding of fetal growth restriction stated in the 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. 2 , 19  The growth restriction observed in offspring in the PCOS group was most pronounced for birth weight and less so for birth length and head circumference. This finding may indicate brain sparing, a fetal prioritization of blood flow to the brain to protect growth and development, in line with states of starvation or placental insufficiency. 31 , 32 Additionally, the growth restriction appeared to be more pronounced among women with overweight and obesity. Overweight and obesity aggravate most symptoms of PCOS, 33 , 34 and the more pronounced growth restriction seen in these groups may represent a more severe PCOS. Stokkeland et al 6 previously reported that women with PCOS showed marked changes in serum cytokine levels throughout pregnancy compared with controls. High immunological activation in the first and third trimesters and inflammatory cytokine levels contributed strongly to these patterns. Members of our study group found that body weight appears to modulate the immune system in PCOS, with elevated levels of numerous multifunctional cytokines in women with overweight and obesity. 6 Possibly, the more activated immune state seen in PCOS, and particularly among women with overweight or obesity combined with PCOS, may partially account for the growth restriction demonstrated in PCOS offspring.   Potential Mechanisms for Growth Restrictions   Androgens  Maternal and/or intrauterine hyperandrogenism has been suggested as a potential mechanism for growth restriction. 9 , 35 , 36 In contrast to these studies, we found no conclusive difference in neonatal anthropometrics between the women with normoandrogenic and hyperandrogenic phenotypes of PCOS. Other studies 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 in line with ours found no difference in the prevalence of SGA offspring in hyperandrogenic vs normoandrogenic PCOS phenotypes.    Placenta  Animal models of PCOS indicate placenta dysfunction as a possible cause of growth restriction. 41 , 42 In the present study, mothers with PCOS more often had newborns with SGA and less often with LGA, and lower placenta weight than the reference group, consistent with placenta dysfunction. On the other hand, we observe a higher BWPW ratio among women with PCOS compared with the reference population. The BWPW ratio is a proxy for placental efficacy, and a higher BWPW ratio indicates upregulated nutrient transport capacity. 43 Although birth weight was lower in infants in the PCOS group, the placenta weight was even more reduced, resulting in a relatively higher BWPW ratio, indicating an upregulated placenta, probably under stress to meet the demands from the fetus. A smaller placenta relative to fetal size appears to be more efficient for nutrient transfer but is also a higher risk for fetal death at term. 44 Interestingly, in an individual patient data analysis of 800 PCOS pregnancies, we observed a perinatal mortality of 1%, which is significantly higher than 0.3% in the general population. 22 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48  Several studies 49 , 50 , 51 find that low birth weight generally is associated with cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes later in life. Seventy children born to mothers with PCOS in the PregMet study 8 were followed up at 8 years of age. These children had more central obesity compared to a reference population, which indicates that the present findings of restricted growth, smaller placentas, and higher BWPW ratio is clinically meaningful and seem to be a marker of long-term metabolic inferiority. Notably, the growth discrepancy at birth was largest in neonates of mothers with obesity, in line with the understanding of maternal obesity being more detrimental for the long-term health of offspring. 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 Smaller head circumference in neonates in the PCOS group might influence cognitive neuropsychological function later in life. However, the follow-up with cognitive testing of a limited number of children from the PregMet study showed intellectual functioning in the reference range. 56 Large register studies and metanalyses 57 , 58 , 59 report a higher prevalence of attention-deficit disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and chronic tic disorder among offspring of women with PCOS.     Strengths and Limitations  A major strength of the study is its large sample size and the possibility of reporting z scores, giving a precise estimate in which we account for offspring sex and gestational age. Possible limitations include the following: (1) data on maternal weight and height in the PCOS group are measured, while they are self-reported in the reference population; and (2) irregular menstruation as a proxy for PCOS in the reference population identifies only a proportion of the women with PCOS. This results in an underestimation of the observed differences. We cannot exclude selection bias of study participants. Participants are mainly of Nordic ancestry, so the results may not be directly applicable to all ancestries. The Norwegian and Canadian GD criteria used in this study limit the generalizability.     Conclusions  The novel finding of the present cohort study is that neonates of mothers with PCOS appear to be growth restricted, with lower birth weight, birth length, and head circumference. This growth restriction also appeared to be more pronounced when adjusting for BMI and potentially for women with overweight and obesity, although the modifying effect of maternal BMI will need to be confirmed in future studies. The smaller placenta and higher BWPW ratio suggest an efficient but stressed placenta that may explain the higher reported perinatal mortality in PCOS. Further studies on this subject are needed.",
