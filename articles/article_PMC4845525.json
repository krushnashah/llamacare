    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the\nmost common endocrinological disorders among\nadolescent girls and women of reproductive age.\nPCOS is the leading cause of female infertility ( 1 ).\nMenstrual irregularity, chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism,\nand multiple small sub-capsular\ncystic follicles in the ovary on ultrasonography\ncharacterize the syndrome. PCOS is associated\nwith insulin resistance, increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders ( 2 ).\nObesity, mainly central obesity, is present in varying\ndegrees (30-70%) in women with PCOS ( 3 , 4 ).\nCentral obesity, being a prominent feature of the\nso-called metabolic syndrome, is directly linked\nto increased peripheral insulin resistance ( 5 ). It\nhas been shown that insulin resistance is responsible\nfor the development of polycystic ovaries in\nPCOS women although obesity seems to be the\nmajor cause ( 6 ). Hence pathogenic determinants\nof PCOS include insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction.\nTherefore, women with PCOS have an\nincreased risk for type 2 diabetes ( 7 ).  The majority of studies that evaluated the prevalence\nof glucose intolerance in PCOS primarily\nincluded obese women, which aggravated their\nrisk for glucose intolerance. Likewise, a high\nprevalence of abnormal glucose intolerance has\nalso been documented in women with PCOS ( 6 ).\nAn elevated luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating\nhormone (LH/FSH) ratio is typically seen in\nPCOS patients. This elevated ratio was considered\nas a gold standard for clinical diagnosis of the disease\n( 8 ) before the proposal of the Rotterdam criteria.\nHowever LH/FSH levels, as a gold standard,\nbecame controversial after a number of studies\nhave reported a variable prevalence of these ratios\n(30-90%) among PCOS women ( 9 , 10 ). An ethnic\nvariation of the metabolic and endocrine pattern in\nPCOS was also reported ( 11 - 13 ).  All features of this syndrome may not be present\nin an individual patient ( 2 , 13 ). Depending\non the interactions of different hormones in PCOS\npatients, the pathogenesis, clinical presentation,\nand biochemical profile varies in an individual. In\ngeneral, the treatment of PCOS patients is targeted\ntowards regularization of menses and recover of\nfertility. PCOS women are at high risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and\nendometrial carcinoma ( 2 , 7 , 9 ). Hence, in addition\nto symptomatic relief, correction of the underlying\nendocrinological pathology and biochemical\nabnormalities at the earliest is necessary. Hence\nbiochemical parameters and the hormone profile\nbecome important in understanding the pathogenesis\nof PCOS. Assessment of the lipid profile,\nglycemic status and endocrine status in PCOS patients\nmay help in making a decision regarding\ntreatment, better outcome, differential diagnosis,\nand prognosis of the disease. With this background\nwe have planned the present study to assess the\nmetabolic profile and endocrine pattern of PCOS\nwomen from Nellore and its surrounding districts\nof Andhra Pradesh, India.    Materials and Methods  We conducted this cross-sectional study at\nNarayana Medical College and Hospital, Nellore,\nAndhra Pradesh, India during the period of October\n2012 to January 2014. The study comprised 80\nnewly diagnosed PCOS women and an equal number\nof age and body mass index (BMI) matched\nhealthy females as controls. All participants were\nin the age group of 19 to 35 years. Patients have\nbeen diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of the\nRotterdam criteria ( 14 ). A total of two out of three\nof the following are required for diagnosis: oligoand/\nor anovulation (defined by the presence of\noligomenorrhea or amenorrhea); clinical and/or\nbiochemical signs of hyperandrogenism [defined\nby presence of hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score\n\u22656), acne or alopecia, and/or elevated androgen\nlevels]; and polycystic ovaries by gynecological\nultrasound. We excluded patients with congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, androgen-\nsecreting tumors, known hypothyroidism on\ntreatment and intake of any medication that affected\nendocrinal parameters.  Height and weight were obtained from each\nsubject. The BMI was calculated as the weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of height in meters.\nAbout 5 ml of blood was collected from the\nantecubital vein. Fasting blood samples were collected\nin plain and sodium fluoride tubes, and then\ncentrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate\nthe serum. Analysis of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides\n(TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-c) and glucose were performed using\ncommercial kits available for a fully automated\nHumastar 600 biochemistry analyzer (Germany).\nWe used Friedwald\u2019s formula to calculate low density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and very low\ndensity lipoprotein (VLDL-c) levels. High sensitive\nC-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured\nby immunoturbidometry (hsCRP Reagent\nKit, CRP-ULTRA turbilatex, Spinreact, Spain).\nHormones free T3 (fT3), free T4 (fT4), thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH), LH, FSH, prolactin\nand insulin were measured by the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) method using a Beckman\nCoulter Access fully automated analyzer. The\nhormone kits used in the Beckman Coulter Access\nanalyzer (USA) were from Beckman Coulter, Ireland.\nWe estimated insulin resistance by the homeostatic\nmodel assessment-insulin resistance\n(HOMAIR) method ( 15 ).   Statistical analysis  All the results were tabulated as mean and standard\ndeviation. We used the SPSS 20.0 version for statistical\nanalysis. The unpaired student t test was used\nto determine the statistical significance between the\nstudy groups. Pearson correlation was used for correlating\ndifferent parameters. A P value of \u02c20.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant.    Ethical considerations  The study was approved by the Narayana Medical\nCollege and Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee,\nNellore, Andhra Pradesh, India. Written\nand informed consent was obtained from the individuals\nwho have participated in the study.     Results  There were 80 clinically proved, confirmed\nPCOS patients in the age range of 19-35 years\nchosen for the study. The mean age of controls\nwas 26.7 \u00b1 3.4 years and for PCOS patients, it\nwas 25.6 \u00b1 3.9 years (P=0.06). The mean BMI\nfor controls was 26.1 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m 2 and 27.0 \u00b1 5.6\nkg/m 2 for PCOS patients (P=0.25). There was no\nsignificant statistical difference in age or BMI between\nPCOS women and controls. We assessed\nboth PCOS women and controls for serum lipid\nprofile, fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, insulin\nresistance (HOMA-IR), thyroid profile, LH,\nFSH, LH/FSH ratio and prolactin levels. Comparisons\nwere made between the two groups. The\nresults of biochemical and hormonal profile findings\nof this study are shown in Table 1.  As seen in Table 1, PCOS patients had higher\nTC, TG, LDL-c and VLDL-c levels (P\u02c20.001)\ncompared to controls which indicated that PCOS\nwomen had dyslipidemia. On the other hand,\nHDL-c showed no significant statistical difference\n(P=0.481) between the groups. Fasting\nglucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance\nshowed a significant increase (P\u02c20.001) in cases\ncompared to controls. Figure 1 shows a graphical\nrepresentation of the mean values of the\nthyroid and gonadotropin hormones. PCOS patients\nhad increased TSH compared to controls\n(P<0.0001). LH and prolactin showed increase\nlevels (P<0.0001) whereas FSH (P<0.0001)\nshowed mildly decreased levels in PCOS women\ncompared to healthy controls ( Table 1 ).

Significant positive correlations between BMI\nwith fasting insulin (r=0.493) and insulin resistance\n(r=0.401, P\u02c20.01) and a significant negative\ncorrelation with LH (r=-0.279, P\u02c20.01)\nwere found in PCOS patients ( Table 2 ). hsCRP\npositively correlated with fasting glucose\n(r=0.816), fasting insulin (r=0.518), insulin resistance\n(r=0.609), LH/FSH ratio (r=0.631) and\nprolactin (r=0.688, P<0.01), and had a negative\ncorrelation with FSH (r=-0.514, P<0.001). Fasting\nglucose showed positive correlations with\nfasting insulin (r=0.703), insulin resistance\n(r=0.811), LH/FSH ratio (r=0.615), and prolactin\n(r=0.699, P<0.01), and a negative correlation\nwith FSH (r=-0.533, P<0.01). Similarly, fasting\ninsulin also showed significant positive correlations\nwith insulin resistance (r=0.981) and prolactin\n(r=0.542, P<0.01). TSH showed positive\ncorrelations with BMI, hsCRP, fasting glucose,\nfasting insulin, insulin resistance, LH/FSH ratio\nand prolactin (r=0.173, P<0.05, r=0.757,\nr=0.772, r=0.499, r=0.583, r=0.492, r=0.693, respectively and P<0.01). LH showed a positive\ncorrelation with LH/FSH ratio (r=0.556,\nP<0.01). FSH showed a negative correlation\nwith LH/FSH ratio (r=-0.571, P<0.01). The LH/\nFSH ratio showed a positive correlation with\nprolactin (r=0.469, P<0.01).

Discussion  PCOS is multi-factorial endocrine disorder associated\nwith derangement in the metabolic profile\nand endocrine pattern. In the present study we\nhave attempted to explore the changes in metabolic\nand hormonal parameters in PCOS women from\nNellore and its surrounding districts of Andhra\nPradesh, India. Out of 80 PCOS women recruited\nfor the study, 42 women were in the age range\nof 20 to 25 years, 29 women were 25 to 30 years\nof age, and 9 women were 30 to 35 years of age.\nThere were 15 patients who presented with a BMI\nlower than 20 kg/m 2 , 10 patients showed a normal\nBMI (20 to 25 kg/m 2 ), 29 patients were overweight\n(BMI 25 to 30 kg/m 2 ), and 26 patients were obese\n(BMI>30 kg/m 2 ). The most common abnormalities\nseen in PCOS are increased BMI, low HDLc\nlevels and elevated TG. In the present study an\nabnormal lipid profile was found in women with\nPCOS. The findings of elevated TC, TG, LDL-c\nand HDL-c agreed with those of Naidu et al. ( 2 ),\nZhang et al. ( 16 ), Kim and Choi ( 17 ), Talbott et al.\n( 18 ), and Saha et al. ( 19 ).  PCOS may represent ( 20 ) a major segment of the\nfemale population at a risk of cardiovascular disease,\nwhich may be related to increased VLDL-c\nlevels. As shown by Wetterau et al. ( 21 ), this increase\nin VLDL-c is basically due to insulin resistance.\nInsulin normally inhibits the expression\nof microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that is\nresponsible for apo-B and VLDL secretion. Hence,\ninsulin resistance may be responsible for increased\nVLDL secretion in PCOS individuals ( 22 ). In the\npresent study we have observed that 70% of PCOS\npatients exhibited an abnormal lipid profile and\nthe mean values of cholesterol, TG, LDL-c and,\nVLDL-c were increased.  Hypothyroidism is the disease state caused by\ninsufficient production of thyroid hormone by the\nthyroid gland. Some authors have affirmed that\ninsulin resistance and increased androgen production\ncan cause hypothyroidism. Insulin resistance\nhas also been considered to be the principal factor\nin the genesis of PCOS ( 23 ). In our study, we\nobserved an increased level of serum TSH and\ndecreased level of fT3 and fT4 hormones. There\nwere 29 out of 80 PCOS patients with TSH levels\n<5.5 mIU/L, 37 patients reported TSH levels\nin the range of 5.5 to 10 mIU/L, and 14 patients\npresented with TSH levels >10 mIU/L. The minimum\nTSH reported value was 3.6 and the maximum\nvalue was 13.4 mIU/L. fT3 and fT4 levels\ndecreased (P\u02c20.0001) in PCOS women compared\nto controls. Our study results agreed with previous\nstudies by Eldar-Geva et al. ( 24 ), Yasmin et al.\n( 25 ), and Anwary et al. ( 26 ).  Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are factors\nthat play an important role in the pathogenesis\nof PCOS. In the present study we have shown predominant\ninsulin resistance, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia,\nand an increased LH/FSH ratio in women\nwith POCS compared to control women ( 2 , 5 , 6 ). The direct effect of testosterone adipocytes has\nbeen investigated and induction of androgen receptor\nmediated insulin resistance via testosterone\nwas established ( 27 ). Hyperandrogenism is due\nto increased LH and low-to-normal FSH levels.\nDue to the increase in LH and estrogen, FSH is\nnegatively inhibited. Theca cell hyperplasia ensues,\nleading to hyperandrogenemia that clinically\npresents as hirsutism. In our study, we have used\nhirsutism as one of the clinical features for the diagnosis\nof hyperandrogenism. BMI has a negative\nassociation with the baseline levels of LH in PCOS\npatients. We observed this association in the present\nstudy, which supported results from previous\nstudies ( 27 , 28 ).  PCOS has been the subject of continuous studies\non diagnosis, management, and therapy. During\nthe 1980s-1990s, the LH/FSH ratio was perceived\nto be the gold standard for the diagnosis of PCOS.\nA higher LH/FSH ratio is no longer a characteristic\nattribute in PCOS as there is excess production of\nLH in PCOS patients, which is associated with the\ninconsistency in LH/FSH ratios in various studies.\nOf the 80 PCOS patients in this study, 18 patients\npresented with LH/FSH ratios lower than 1.5, 33\npatients ranged from 1.5 to 2.0, and the remaining\n29 had LH/FSH ratios higher than 2. Normal prolactin\nlevels were reported in 15 patients, prolactin\nlevels in the range of 19.5 to 50 ng/ml were shown\nin 26 patients, 36 patients had levels in the range\nof 51 to 100 ng/ml, and the remaining 3 patients\npresented with levels higher than 100 ng/ml.  In the current study, we observed a mild increase\nin the prolactin level (50.65 \u00b1 27.11 ng/ml) in\n68% cases, which was similar to previous studies\nconducted by Kalsum and Jalali ( 29 ) where 69.51% of subfertile women suffered from hyperprolactinemia.\nNizam et al. ( 30 ) also showed that\nhyperprolactinemia was a major cause of subfertility.\nTreatment with drugs that lowered prolactin\nlevels resulted in pregnancy for 24% of the infertile\nwomen. This finding was consistent with our\nstudy.    Conclusion  In the present study, we showed the biochemical\nand hormonal imbalances that underlie the\ncomplex endocrinological cascade of PCOS\nin Nellore and its surrounding districts of the\nAndhra Pradesh population. PCOS patients in\nthis population presented with a higher prevalence\nof insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism.\nMetabolic and endocrine patterns\nindicated that PCOS patients were at higher risk\nof developing diabetes as well as cardiovascular\ndisease. An increased concentration of LH,\nmild hyperprolactinaemia, higher LH/FSH ratio,\nand decreased FSH has suggested that there is a\ndisturbance in the normal gonadotropin ovarian\naxis. Further correlation study has revealed that\nLH is inversely proportional to BMI. A LH/FSH\nratio greater than 2.0 can be useful in the diagnosis\nof PCOS women in our population. Hence\nwe recommend that screening of PCOS patients\nfor metabolic and endocrine parameters will help\nin the management and treatment of PCOS for a\nbetter outcome.",
