    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial heterogeneous clinical syndrome\ncharacterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, and is one of the most\nprevalent endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age. PCOS is associated with\nfollicle growth arrest, chronic anovulation, minimal granulosa cell proliferation,\nhyperthecosis with hyperandrogenemia, and insulin resistance.  1  Several studies 2 \u2013 4 have\ndemonstrated that PCOS is a complex and multifactorial disorder involving adipocyte\nfactors. Abnormal lipid metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of\nmany diseases.  2  Adiponectin, together with adipocyte size, is the strongest factor associated\nwith insulin resistance in women with PCOS.  3  Metabolic abnormalities are also more prevalent in obese PCOS women.  4  Androgen excess, insulin resistance, and adipocyte factors are thus the three\nmain factors determining the symptoms of PCOS.  Chemerin is a chemoattractant ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor chemokine\nreceptor-like 1 (CMKLR1). Chemerin has been shown to promote adipogenesis and\nregulate immunity and glucose metabolism.  5  The chemerin gene, located at 7q361, encodes a precursor protein containing\n163 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 18 kD, which is transformed into\nactive chemerin after digestion of hydrolytic carboxyl by extracellular\nprotease, 6 , 7 then released into the body fluids. Patients with PCOS were shown to have increased\nserum chemerin concentrations. 8 , 9 In addition, elevated chemerin\ninduced insulin resistance in human granulosa-lutein cells from PCOS patients,  8  and individuals with higher chemerin expression tended to have a higher risk\nof PCOS.  9  However, chemerin\u2019s function in PCOS is largely unknown.  Autophagy is a major degradative pathway responsible for energy stress and cellular\nhomeostasis to maintain energy production, as well as the synthesis of new\nmacromolecules. Increasing evidence has revealed that increased autophagy is\nassociated with chronic inflammatory behavior in polycystic ovaries.  10  Li et\u00a0al.  11  reported that 41 autophagy-related genes were differentially expressed in\nPCOS patients and animal models, including genes involved in four significant\npathways: the insulin, ErbB, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling\npathways, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.  In the current study, we aimed to provide evidence for a potential role of chemerin\nin autophagy disorders in PCOS. We investigated the relationship between chemerin\nand PCOS and autophagy in a rat model in vivo and in human\ngranulosa cells in vitro, and discussed the potential clinical\napplications of chemerin.    Materials and methods   Rat model of PCOS  Forty specific-pathogen-free (SPF) female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (55\u201370\u2009g, 21 days\nold) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Chongqing Medical\nUniversity. The rats were kept in an SPF-class laboratory animal room in\nChongqing Medical University, and housed at a constant temperature of 20\u00b0C, with\nlight from 08:00 to 20:00 and dark from 20:00 to 08:00. Standard chow and water\nwere available.  All the rats were fed for 7 consecutive days to adapt to the environment. Forty\nrats were then divided randomly into four experimental groups (n\u2009=\u200910 per\ngroup). Rats in the high-fat diet group (F) were fed a high-fat diet (26.2\u2009g%\nprotein, 26.3\u2009g% carbohydrate, and 34.9\u2009g% fat); rats in the testosterone\npropionate (#154498, Aike Reagent, Chengdu, China) group (T) were injected\nsubcutaneously with testosterone propionate 10\u2009mg/kg/day (dissolved in 0.2\u2009ml\nolive oil); rats in the high-fat diet/testosterone propionate group (model\ngroup) were fed a high-fat diet and injected subcutaneously with testosterone\npropionate 10\u2009mg/kg/day (dissolved in 0.2\u2009ml olive oil) at the same time; and\ncontrol group rats were fed a normal diet and injected subcutaneously with an\nidentical volume of olive oil. All the experimental groups were managed for 56 days.  12  The basic principle of the model was that excessive androgen interferes\nwith follicle growth and maturation resulting in non-ovulation, and a high-fat\ndiet leads to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, similar to PCOS.    Sample collection  All the rats were weighed every 2 days. Vaginal smears were monitored daily for\n10 consecutive days to determine the stage of the estrus cycle, starting at day\n54. Vaginal smears obtained by vaginal washing were analyzed under a microscope\nto determine the predominant cell type. Vaginal epithelium with sustained\nkeratosis represented successful establishment of the PCOS model. At the end of\nthe study, all rats were fasted overnight and infused intragastrically with\n2\u2009g/kg glucose, and blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes\nto evaluate blood glucose levels. The rats were then sacrificed using\npentobarbital sodium (intravenous 100\u2009mg/kg) and blood samples obtained from\nrats fasted for 12 hours were centrifuged at 350\u2009\u00d7 g for 15\nminutes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Ovary tissues were also obtained from all rats and\nstored at \u221280\u00b0C. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and smears of exfoliated\nvaginal cells were used to confirm the creation of the rat model. All animal\nexperimental procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use and Care of\nAnimals of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (CMU201866, approved\non September 1, 2018) and performed in accordance with the institution\u2019s guidelines.  13  All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and to\ndecrease their suffering.    Cell culture and transfection  COV434 human ovarian granulosa cells derived from a solid primary granulosa tumor\nwere purchased from Beijing Beina Chuanglian Biotechnology Institute, Beijing,\nChina (No. BNCC338036) and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium\n(10-017-CVR; Corning, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were\nincubated under 5% carbon dioxide at 37\u00b0C.  Lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting chemerin (LV3-590 and\nLV3-1623) and the chemerin-lentiviral expression vector (LV5-chemerin) were\nprovided by Genepharma (Shanghai, China). The autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1\n(Cat. No: S1413; Selleck Chemicals) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and\ndiluted with serum-free culture medium to reach a concentration of 100\u2009nM. The\nmTOR inhibitor, Torin1 (Cat. no: S2827; Selleck Chemicals, Shanghai, China),\nwhich induces autophagy, was used to treat cells at a concentration of 10\u2009mM.\nCell proliferation of COV434 cells was detected in vitro using\nCell-Light\u2122 EdU (C10310; Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China) and\napoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (Accuri C6; Biosciences, NY, USA).    Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)  Total RNA was isolated using a high-purity Total RNA Rapid Extraction Kit\n(RP1201; Bioteke Corporation, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. cDNA was synthesized using an Iscript cDNA synthesis kit (4106228;\nBio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). The primers used for amplifying chemerin and\nCMKLR1 and \u03b2-actin were synthesized by GeneCopoeia (Guangzhou, China). The\nRT-qPCR kit was purchased from GeneCopoeia. The PCR conditions were as follows:\n95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009s. Each sample was analyzed in\ntriplicate. Relative quantification of mRNA was performed using the comparative\nthreshold cycle (CT) method. This value was used to plot the gene expression\nusing the formula 2 \u2212\u25b3\u25b3CT .    Western blot  Pathways that activate mTOR, such as Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK), inhibit autophagy, while pathways that negatively regulate mTOR, such as\nAMP-activated protein kinase, promote autophagy. When mTOR inhibition occurs,\nUnc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) induces autophagy by\nphosphorylation of beclin-1.  14  We analyzed the protein expression levels of CMKLR1, phosphoinositide\n3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, MAPK, ULK-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),\nphospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), and \u03b2-actin by western blot, using the following primary\nantibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-chemerin (ab103153; Abcam, Shanghai, China);\npolyclonal rabbit anti-CMKLR1 (bs-10410R; Bioss Biotechnology Company, Beijing,\nChina); rabbit monoclonal to ULK1 (D8H5) (#8054; Cell Signaling Technology, MA,\nUSA); rabbit monoclonal to p-mTOR (Ser2448) (#5536; Cell Signaling Technology);\nrabbit monoclonal to MAPK (#8690; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit monoclonal\nto Akt (#4691; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit monoclonal to PI3K Class III\n(D9A5) (#4263; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit monoclonal to LC3A/B (D3U4C)\n(#12741S; Cell Signaling Technology); and polyclonal rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin\n(#4970S; Cell Signaling Technology). Band density was analyzed using a gel\nimaging system and compared with an internal control, as described previously.  15      Statistical analysis  All the experiments were conducted at least three times individually. Statistical\nanalysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0 (GraphPad\nSoftware, CA, USA), and values were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Means\nwere compared between groups using Student's t -test, and means were\ncompared among multiple groups by one-way ANOVA. Comparisons between groups were\nmade using the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test. A P value <0.05 was\nconsidered significant.    Results   Chemerin/CMKLR1 expression were increased in ovarian tissues in PCOS model\nrats  PCOS model rats (n\u2009=\u200910) were injected subcutaneously with testosterone\npropionate (1\u2009mg/100\u2009g rat) and fed a high-fat diet. Control rats (n\u2009=\u200910) rats\nwere fed an ordinary diet and injected subcutaneously with an equal volume of\nolive oil. Based on the results of vaginal smears, six successful PCOS model\nrats were selected for further analysis. Body weights were significantly higher\nin the model (F&T) compared with the control rats (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Figure 1a ). However, the\nOGTT results showed that rats in the model group also developed significantly\nimpaired glucose tolerance (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Figure 1b ). The results of vaginal\nsmears revealed that the estrous cycle was inhibited in the PCOS rats ( Figure 1c ). In addition,\nmRNA and protein levels of chemerin and CMKLR1 were significantly increased in\nPCOS model rats ( Figure 1d,\ne ).   Figure 1.

Chemerin regulated the proliferation and apoptosis of COV434 cells in\nvitro  We also examined the function of chemerin in COV434 human ovarian granulosa\ncells. The mRNA and protein levels of chemerin and its receptor CMKLR1 were\nincreased in LV5-chemerin-transfected COV434 cells compared with control cells\n( Figure 2a\u2013c ), but\nwere reduced in cells transfected with LV3-590 and LV3-1623 ( Figure 2a\u2013c ). We also\nexamined the effect of chemerin on the proliferation and apoptosis of COV434\ncells. Cell proliferation was suppressed in LV3-590-transfected and\nLV3-1623-transfected cells compared with control cells. In contrast,\ntransfection with LV5-chemerin promoted cell proliferation ( Figure 2d ). Apoptosis measured by flow\ncytometry was decreased in LV5-chemerin-transfected cells and increased in\nLV3-590-transfected and LV3-1623-transfected cells ( Figure 2e ). These results indicated that\nchemerin promoted cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in COV434\ncells.   Figure 2.   Chemerin regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis in\nvitro .

Chemerin promoted COV434 cell autophagy  LC3 is a marker of autophagy. During autophagy, cytoplasmic LC3-I is transformed\ninto membrane LC3-II, and the LC3-II/I ratio can thus be used to estimate the\nlevel of autophagy. We studied the molecular mechanism of autophagy induced by\nchemerin. LC3-II expression was significantly decreased in LV3-590- and\nLV3-1623-transfected COV434 cells ( P <\u20090.001) and increased\nin LV5-chemerin-transfected COV434 cells compared with control cells\n( P <\u20090.01) ( Figure 3a, b ). Expression of p-mTOR was\nelevated in LV3-590- ( P <\u20090.05) and LV3-1623-transfected\nCOV434 cells ( P <\u20090.01), but suppressed in\nLV5-chemerin-transfected COV434 cells compared with the control group\n( P <\u20090.01) ( Figure 3a, b ). Similarly, PI3K, Akt, and\nERK expression were up-regulated in LV3-590- and LV3-1623-transfected but\ndown-regulated in LV5-chemerin-transfected COV434 cells (all P <\u20090.01). As expected, ULK-1 expression was reduced in\nLV3-590- ( P <\u20090.001) and LV3-1623-transfected cells\n( P <\u20090.05) but increased in LV5-chemerin-transfected\nCOV434 cells ( P <\u20090.01), while MAPK was increased in\nLV3-590- ( P <\u20090.01) and LV3-1623-transfected COV434 cells\n( P <\u20090.001) but reduced in LV5-chemerin-transfected\nCOV434 cells ( P <\u20090.01). These data confirmed that chemerin\npromoted the autophagy of COV434 cells.   Figure 3.   Chemerin promoted COV434 cell autophagy. (a and b) Protein expression\nlevels of LC3-II, p-mTOR, Akt, ERK, PI3K, MAPK, and ULK-1 in COV434\ncells were detected by western blot. Error bars represent standard\nerror.

Chemerin promoted autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling\npathway  Bafilomycin A1 is an inhibitor of autophagy, while Torin1 inhibits mTOR and\ninduces autophagy. LC3-II expression was enhanced by the addition of Torin1 to\nLV5-chemerin-transfected COV434 cells ( P <\u20090.05 vs.\nchemerin) ( Figure 4a ),\nbut these elevated levels of LC3-II were reversed by the addition of bafilomycin\nA1 ( P <\u20090.001 vs. chemerin) ( Figure 4b ). Bafilomycin A1 also\ninhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of COV434 cells induced\nby chemerin, while Torin1 promoted the chemerin-induced proliferation and\napoptosis ( Figure 4c,\nd ). These results indicate that chemerin promoted autophagy by inhibiting\nthe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thus promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting\napoptosis.   Figure 4.

Discussion  The main clinical manifestations of PCOS are obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin\nresistance. Numerous studies are currently investigating the pathological mechanism\nof PCOS, including regulation of the brain\u2013gut axis and hormones.  16  However, the cellular response in the ovary may be the initial pathological\nmechanism of PCOS, and recent studies found that LC3 protein was mainly expressed in\nfollicular granulosa cells, and that excessive autophagy in ovarian granulosa cells\nmay lead to the occurrence of PCOS.  17   The newly identified adipocytokine chemerin plays an important role in lipid\nformation and blood glucose regulation.  18  Patients with PCOS had abnormally high serum levels of chemerin, which were\nreduced by the use of metformin for symptom relief.  19  In addition, clinical data suggest that obesity and type 2 diabetes are also\nassociated with increased chemerin,  20  and this correlation between chemerin and metabolism supports an association\nbetween chemerin and PCOS. The current results showed that chemerin and its receptor\nCMKLR1 were also elevated in ovarian tissues in a PCOS rat model, suggesting that\nectopic expression of chemerin may play an important role in PCOS. Chemerin may be\ninvolved in regulating the proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of COV434 cells.\nA previous report showed that chemerin promoted the proliferation and invasion of\nsquamous esophageal cancer cells,  21  and the present study similarly showed that chemerin promoted the\nproliferation and suppressed the apoptosis of COV434 cells.  Autophagy is enhanced in ovarian tissues in both humans and rats with PCOS. Ovarian\ngranulosa cells in a PCOS rat model showed increased expression of the autophagy\nmarker protein light chain 3B (LC3B).  22  In the current study, chemerin promoted the expression of LC3-II, indicating\npromotion of autophagy. Previous studies demonstrated that autophagy may be\nregulated by the PI3K, Akt, and ERK pathway. 23 , 24 The current results\naccordingly indicated that chemerin/CMKLR1 inhibited the expression of PI3K, Akt,\nand ERK and promoted the expression of ULK-1, thus inducing autophagy. Chemerin also\ninhibited the expression of MAPK. mTOR acts as an intersection among many pathways,\nand mTOR activation inhibited autophagy while its inhibition promoted\nautophagy. 25 , 26 These results revealed that chemerin promoted cell autophagy\nvia inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathway. However, inhibition of\nautophagy decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, indicating that\nchemerin-induced autophagy promoted cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis during\nstarvation, which may be associated with formation of PCOS.  Although this study provided preliminary confirmation of the role of chemerin in\nPCOS, further studies are needed to determine its effects on ovarian function during\nthe development of PCOS and its possible use as a target for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of PCOS.  In conclusion, the current results indicated that chemerin and CMKLR1 expression were\nelevated in a PCOS rat model. Chemerin may promote autophagy by inhibiting the\nPI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and may provide a potential therapeutic target and biomarker\nof PCOS.",
