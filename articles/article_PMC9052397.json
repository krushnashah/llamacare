    "abstract": "What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference? International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS. Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist. International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength. Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels. The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided. The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.",
    "body": "1 |  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ADOLESCENTS AND WOMEN WITH PCOS?  This guideline aims to optimize evidence-based, consistent care that meets the needs and improves the quality of life of women with PCOS. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages, targeting areas and outcomes of priority for women with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their health care providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on partnership in care and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered. With effective translation, the guideline and health professional and consumer resources will address gaps and priorities identified by women with PCOS and will promote vital future research.    2 |  INTRODUCTION  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. 1 , 2 PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. 1 , 2 Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. 3 \u2013 5 Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, 6 \u2013 10 resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.  This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to upskill health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.    3 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Best practice evidence-based guideline development methods were applied and are detailed in the full guideline and the technical reports and outlined in Figure 1 and available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . 11 The process aligns with all elements of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool for quality guideline assessment. 12 This involved extensive evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework covering evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength. 13 Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice. 12 \u2013 15 Categories include evidence-based or consensus recommendations with accompanying clinical practice points ( Table 1 ).  Terms include \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d and \u201cshould not,\u201d are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and quality of the evidence and are independent descriptors reflecting the judgement of the multidisciplinary GDG including consumers. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. \u201cShould\u201d is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms, and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. \u201cCould\u201d is used where either the quality of evidence was limited or the available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harm was unclear. \u201cShould not\u201d is used where there is either a lack of appropriate evidence, or the harms may outweigh the benefits.  The GRADE of the recommendation is determined by the GDG based on comprehensive structured consideration of all elements of the GRADE framework, 4 including desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, resource requirements and cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility and includes:    * Conditional recommendation against the option;    ** Conditional recommendation for either the option or the comparison;    *** Conditional recommendation for the option;    **** Strong recommendation for the option.    Quality of the evidence is categorized according to: the number and design of studies addressing the outcome; judgments about the quality of the studies and/or synthesized evidence, such as risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and any other considerations that may influence the quality of the evidence; key statistical data; and classification of the importance of the outcomes ( Table 2 ). The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence in an estimate of the effect to support a particular recommendation 4 and was largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team.  Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation acknowledges that evidence quality is a continuum; any discrete categorization involves a degree of arbitrariness. Nevertheless, advantages of simplicity, transparency, and vividness outweigh these limitations. 4    4 |  RESULTS  The recommendation table ( Table 3 ) applies the category, descriptive terms, GRADE of the recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The full guideline is available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . The full version of the guideline outlines the clinical need for the question, the clinical question, the evidence summary, the recommendation and practice points and a summary of the justification developed by the GDGs using the GRADE framework, refined by extensive international peer review. The comprehensive evidence reviews, profiles and GRADE frameworks supporting each recommendation, can be found at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos in the Supplementary Technical Reports. The peer review feedback, administrative report on guideline development and disclosure of interest process and declarations can be found at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . Here we present the clinical topic area recommendations and practice points ( Table 3 ). This summary, the full guideline and technical reports are supported by a comprehensive co-designed translation program to optimize dissemination and impact with resources freely available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos .    5 |  DISCUSSION  The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.  We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antim\u00fcllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.  The combined effects of the provision of a single source of evidence-based recommendations and comprehensive international translation and dissemination program will amplify impact of the guideline and recommendations globally. It will support and build the capability of health professionals to deliver high-quality, evidence-based assessment and management of PCOS and will augment the health literacy and self-management of PCOS health consumers. The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however the process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . The guideline and translation program will contribute to early diagnosis and improved health outcomes and promote best-practice PCOS models of care. The translation program will be inclusive of a range of outputs such as; the first evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), a rigorously developed question prompt list to optimize health professional engagement, health literacy enhancing tools, comprehensive PCOS related health information; internationally accessible health professional accredited courses, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos . Most importantly, the guideline and translation of the guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, accessible evidence-based information and improved multi-disciplined support. Ultimately, this initiative may serve as an exemplar for international collaborative engagement and healthcare impact. Key elements included extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation including consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation and evaluation.",

            "content": "Category  Recommendation  GRADE and quality      1. Screening, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment, and life-stage    Irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction    CCR  Irregular menstrual cycles are defined acs: \u2022 Normal in the first year post menarche as part of the pubertal transition \u2022 1 to <3 years post menarche: <21 or >45 days. \u2022 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: <21 or >35 d or <8 cycles per year. \u2022 1 year post menarche >90 days for any one cycle. \u2022 Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or >3 years post thelarche (breast development). When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to the guidelines   ****     CCR  In an adolescent with irregular menstrual cycles, the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the patient, taking into account diagnostic challenges at this life stage and psychosocial and cultural factors   ****     CPP  For adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet diagnostic criteria, an \u201cincreased risk\u201d could be considered and reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche. This includes those with PCOS features before combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) commencement, those with persisting features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence.     CPP  Ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and if anovulation needs to be confirmed serum progesterone levels can be measured  \u2013    Biochemical hyperandrogenism    EBR  Calculated free testosterone, free androgen index, or calculated bioavailable testosterone should be used to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis of PCOS  **** \u2295\u2295\u25cb\u25cb    EBR  High quality assays such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) and extraction/chromatography immunoassays, should be used for the most accurate assessment of total or free testosterone in PCOS  *** \u2295\u2295\u25cb\u25cb    EBR  Androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) could be considered if total or free testosterone are not elevated; however, these provide limited additional information in the diagnosis of PCOS  *** \u2295\u2295\u25cb\u25cb    CCR  Direct free testosterone assays, such as radiometric or enzyme-linked assays, preferably should not be used in assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS, as they demonstrate poor sensitivity, accuracy and precision     CPP  Reliable assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is not possible in women on hormonal contraception, due to effects on sex hormone-binding globulin and altered gonadotrophin-dependent androgen production  \u2013    CPP  Where assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is important in women on hormonal contraception, drug withdrawal is recommended for three months or longer before measurement, and contraception management with a non-hormonal alternative is needed during this time  \u2013    CPP  Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is most useful in establishing the diagnosis of PCOS and/or phenotype where clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (in particular hirsutism) are unclear or absent  \u2013    CPP  Interpretation of androgen levels needs to be guided by the reference ranges of the laboratory used, acknowledging that ranges for different methods and laboratories vary widely. Normal values are ideally based on levels from a well phenotyped healthy control population or by cluster analysis of a large general population considering age and pubertal specific stages  \u2013    CPP  Where androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, other causes of biochemical hyperandrogenism need to be considered. History of symptom onset and progression is critical in assessing for neoplasia, however, some androgen-secreting neoplasms may only induce mild to moderate increases in biochemical hyperandrogenism  \u2013    Clinical hyperandrogenism    CCR  A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, including acne, alopecia, and hirsutism and, in adolescents, severe acne and hirsutism   ****     CCR  Health professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism. Reported unwanted excess hair growth and/or alopecia should be considered important, regardless of apparent clinical severity   ****     CCR  Standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism, such as the modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) with a level \u22654-6 indicating hirsutism, depending on ethnicity, acknowledging that self-treatment is common and can limit clinical assessment. (See recommendations on ethnic variation)   ****     CCR  The Ludwig visual score is preferred for assessing the degree and distribution of alopecia   ****     CPP  There are no universally accepted visual assessments for evaluating acne     CPP  The prevalence of hirsutism is the same across ethnicities, yet the mFG cut-off scores for defining hirsutism and the severity of hirsutism varies by ethnicity  \u2013    CPP  As ethnic variation in vellus hair density is notable, over-estimation of hirsutism may occur if vellus hair is confused with terminal hair; only terminal hairs need to be considered in pathological hirsutism, with terminal hairs clinically growing >5 mm in length if untreated, varying in shape and texture and generally being pigmented  \u2013    Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM)    CCR  Ultrasound should not be used for the diagnosis of PCOS in those with a gynecological age of <8 years (<8 years after menarche), due to the high incidence of multi-follicular ovaries in this life stage   ****     CCR  The threshold for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-specific cut off values for PCOM should be defined   ****     CCR  The transvaginal ultrasound approach is preferred in the diagnosis of PCOS, if sexually active and if acceptable to the individual being assessed   ****     CCR  Using endovaginal ultrasound transducers with a frequency bandwidth that includes 8 MHz, the threshold for PCOM on either ovary, a follicle number per ovary of \u226520 and/or an ovarian volume \u226510 ml on either ovary, ensuring no corpora lutea, cysts or dominant follicles are present   ***     CPP  If using older technology, the threshold for PCOM could be an ovarian volume \u226510 ml on either ovary  \u2013    CPP  In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis; however, ultrasound will identify the complete PCOS phenotype  \u2013    CPP  In transabdominal ultrasound reporting is best focused on ovarian volume with a threshold of \u226510 ml, given the difficulty of reliably assessing follicle number with this approach  \u2013    CPP  Clear protocols are recommended for reporting follicle number per ovary and ovarian volume on ultrasound. Recommended minimum reporting standards include: \u2022 Last menstrual period. \u2022 Transducer bandwidth frequency. \u2022 Approach/route assessed. \u2022 Total follicle number per ovary measuring 2-9 mm. \u2022 Three dimensions and volume of each ovary. \u2022 Reporting of endometrial thickness and appearance is referred; three-layer endometrial assessment may be useful to screen for endometrial pathology. \u2022 Other ovarian and uterine pathology, as well as ovarian cysts, corpus luteum, dominant follicles \u226510 mm.  \u2013    CPP  There is a need for training in careful and meticulous follicle counting per ovary, to improve reporting  \u2013    Antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH)    EBR  Serum AMH levels should not yet be used as an alternative for the detection of PCOM or as a single test for the diagnosis of PCOS  *** \u2295\u2295\u25cb\u25cb    CPP  There is emerging evidence that with improved standardization of assays and established cut off levels or thresholds based on large scale validation in populations of different ages and ethnicities, AMH assays will be more accurate in the detection of PCOM  \u2013    Ethnic variation    CCR  Health professionals should consider ethnic variation in the presentation and manifestations of PCOS, including: \u2022 A relatively mild phenotype in Caucasians. \u2022 Higher body mass index (BMI) in Caucasian women, especially in North America and Australia. \u2022 More severe hirsutism in Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Mediterranean women. \u2022 Increased central adiposity, insulin resistance, diabetes, metabolic risks, and acanthosis nigricans in South East Asians and Indigenous Australians. \u2022 Lower BMI and milder hirsutism in East Asians. \u2022 Higher BMI and metabolic features in Africans.   ****     Menopause life stage    CCR  Postmenopausal persistence of PCOS could be considered likely with continuing evidence of hyperandrogenism   ***     CCR  A diagnosis of PCOS postmenopause could be considered if there is a past diagnosis of PCOS, a long-term history of irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the reproductive years  \u2013    CPP  Postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism, require investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis  \u2013    Cardiovascular disease risk (CVD)    CCR  All those with PCOS should be offered regular monitoring for weight changes and excess weight, in consultation with and where acceptable to the individual woman. Monitoring could be at each visit or at a minimum 6-12 monthly, with frequency planned and agreed between the health professional and the individual   ****     CCR  Weight, height, and ideally waist circumference should be measured and BMI calculated with the following considered: \u2022 BMI categories and waist circumference should follow World Health Organization guidelines, also noting ethnic and adolescent ranges. \u2022 Consideration should be given for Asian and high-risk ethnic groups including recommended monitoring of waist circumference.  \u2013    CCR  All women with PCOS should be assessed for cardiovascular risk factors and global CVD risk   ****     CCR  If screening reveals CVD risk factors including obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and lack of physical activity, women with PCOS should be considered at increased risk of CVD  \u2013    CCR  Overweight and obese women with PCOS, regardless of age, should have a fasting lipid profile (cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride level at diagnosis). Thereafter, frequency of measurement should be based on the presence of hyperlipidemia and global CVD risk  \u2013    CCR  All women with PCOS should have blood pressure measured annually, or more frequently based on global CVD risk   ****     CPP  Health professionals need to be aware that CVD risk in women with PCOS remains unclear pending high quality studies, however prevalence of CVD risk factors is increased, warranting consideration of screening  \u2013    CPP  Consideration needs to be given to the significant differences in CVD risk across ethnicities (See Ethnic variation) when determining frequency of risk assessment  \u2013    Gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes    CCR  Health professionals and women with PCOS should be aware that, regardless of age, the prevalence of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes (5-fold in Asia, 4-fold in the Americas, and 3-fold in Europe) are significantly increased in PCOS, with risk independent of, yet exacerbated by, obesity   ****     CCR  Glycemic status should be assessed at baseline in all women with PCOS. Thereafter, assessment should be every one to three years, influenced by the presence of other diabetes risk factors   ****     CCR  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c should be performed to assess glycemic status. In high-risk women with PCOS (including a BMI >25 kg/m 2 or in Asians >23 kg/m 2 , history of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension or high-risk ethnicity), an OGTT is recommended   ****     CCR  A 75-g OGTT should be offered in all women with PCOS preconception when planning pregnancy or seeking fertility treatment, given the high risk of hyperglycemia and the associated comorbidities in pregnancy. If not performed preconception, an OGTT should be offered at <20 weeks gestation, and all women with PCOS should be offered the test at 24-28 weeks gestation   ****     Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)    CCR  Screening should only be considered for OSA in PCOS to identify and alleviate related symptoms, such as snoring, waking unrefreshed from sleep, daytime sleepiness, and the potential for fatigue to contribute to mood disorders. Screening should not be considered with the intention of improving cardiometabolic risk, with inadequate evidence for metabolic benefits of OSA treatment in PCOS and in general populations   ****     CCR  A simple screening questionnaire, preferably the Berlin tool, could be applied and if positive, referral to a specialist considered   ****     CPP  A positive screen raises the likelihood of OSA, however it does not quantify symptom burden and alone does not justify treatment. If women with PCOS have OSA symptoms and a positive screen, consideration can be given to referral to a specialist center for further evaluation  \u2013    Endometrial cancer    CCR  Health professionals and women with PCOS should be aware of a 2- to 6-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer, which often presents before menopause; however absolute risk of endometrial cancer remains relatively low  \u2013    CPP  Health professionals require a low threshold for investigation of endometrial cancer in women with PCOS or a history of PCOS, with investigation by transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy recommended with persistent thickened endometrium and/or risk factors including prolonged amenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding or excess weight. However, routine ultrasound screening of endometrial thickness in PCOS is not recommended  \u2013    CPP  Optimal prevention for endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer is not known. A pragmatic approach could include COCP or progestin therapy in those with cycles longer than 90 days  \u2013    2. Prevalence, screening, diagnostic assessment and treatment in emotional wellbeing    Quality of life    CCR  Health professionals and women should be aware of the adverse impact of PCOS on quality of life   ****     CCR  Health professionals should capture and consider perceptions of symptoms, impact on quality of life and personal priorities for care to improve patient outcomes   ****     CPP  The PCOS quality of life tool (PCOSQ), or the modified PCOSQ, may be useful clinically to highlight PCOS features causing greatest distress, and to evaluate treatment outcomes on women\u2019s subjective PCOS health concerns  \u2013    Depressive and anxiety symptoms, screening and treatment    CCR  Health professionals should be aware that in PCOS, there is a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms in adults; and a likely increased prevalence in adolescents   ****     CCR  Anxiety and depressive symptoms should be routinely screened in all adolescents and women with PCOS at diagnosis. If the screen for these symptoms and/or other aspects of emotional wellbeing is positive, further assessment and/or referral for assessment and treatment should be completed by suitably qualified health professionals, informed by regional guidelines   ****     CCR  If treatment is warranted, psychological therapy and/or pharmacological treatment should be offered in PCOS, informed by regional clinical practice guidelines   ****     CPP  The optimal interval for anxiety and depressive symptom screening is not known. A pragmatic approach could include repeat screening using clinical judgment, considering risk factors, comorbidities and life events  \u2013    CPP  Assessment of anxiety and or depressive symptoms involves assessment of risk factors, symptoms and severity. Symptoms can be screened according to regional guidelines, or by using simple stepwise approaches (see full guideline for details)  \u2013    CPP  Where pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depression is offered in PCOS, the following need consideration: \u2022 Caution is needed to avoid inappropriate treatment with antidepressants or anxiolytics. Where mental health disorders are clearly documented and persistent, or if suicidal symptoms are present, treatment of depression or anxiety need to be informed by clinical regional practice guidelines. \u2022 Use of agents that exacerbate PCOS symptoms, including weight gain, need careful consideration.  \u2013    CPP  Factors including obesity, infertility, and hirsutism need consideration along with use of hormonal medications in PCOS, as they may independently exacerbate depressive and anxiety symptoms and other aspects of emotional wellbeing  \u2013    Psychosexual function    CCR  All health professionals should be aware of the increased prevalence of psychosexual dysfunction and should consider exploring how features of PCOS, including hirsutism and body image, impact on sex life and relationships in PCOS   ****     CCR  If psychosexual dysfunction is suspected, tools such as the Female Sexual Function Index can be considered   ****     Body image    CCR  Health professionals and women should be aware that features of PCOS can impact on body image   ***     CPP  Negative body image, can be screened according to regional guidelines or by using a stepped approach (see full guideline for details)  \u2013    Eating disorders and disordered eating    CCR  All health professionals and women should be aware of the increased prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating associated with PCOS  \u2013    CCR  If eating disorders and disordered eating are suspected, further assessment, referral and treatment, including psychological therapy, could be offered by appropriately trained health professionals, informed by regional guidelines or by using a stepped approach (see full guideline for details)  \u2013    Information resources, models of care, cultural and linguistic considerations    CCR  Information and education resources for women with PCOS should be culturally appropriate, tailored and high-quality, should use a respectful and empathetic approach, and promote self-care and highlight peer support groups   ****     CCR  Information and education resources for healthcare professionals should promote the recommended diagnostic criteria, appropriate screening for comorbidities, and effective lifestyle and pharmacological management   ****     CCR  PCOS information should be comprehensive, evidence-based, and inclusive of the biopsychosocial dimensions of PCOS across the life-span   ****     CCR  Women\u2019s needs, communication preferences, beliefs, and culture should be considered and addressed through provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate co-designed resources and care   ****     CPP  Interdisciplinary care needs to be considered for those with PCOS where appropriate and available.
