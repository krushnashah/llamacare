Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women, is characterized by\nheterogeneous complications ( 1 ). The prevalence of\nPCOS has increased in the general population, with reported rates of 6\u201310% in adult women\nand 6\u201318% in adolescent girls ( 2 , 3 , 4 ). PCOS is also common among\nfemale adolescents and is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. The\nWorld Health Organization defines adolescents as young persons aged between 10 and 19 yr who\nshow critical growth, development, and pubertal changes ( 5 ). Menstrual irregularity, sonographic polycystic ovarian morphology, and acne\nare normal pubertal physiological changes during adolescence. For this reason, the PCOS\ndiagnostic criteria used in adults are not applied in adolescents. International guidelines\naiming to optimize the accuracy of diagnosis and to improve health care for adolescents have\nbeen published ( 5 , 6 , 7 ). According to the guidelines, evidence\nof menstrual irregularity in adolescents according to time after menarche and the presence\nof clinical or laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism are sufficient for the diagnosis of\nPCOS. Pelvic investigation with ultrasonography for diagnosing PCOS is not recommended\nbecause of the physiological multifollicular appearance of the ovaries in adolescents. The\nfollicle size and number change with age, and the greatest number of small follicles is\nobserved during adolescence and young adulthood, with a significant decrease in follicle\ncount with age. The ovarian volume also increases during puberty and reaches the adult\nvolume in the years after menarche ( 7 , 8 ).  The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms is high in patients\nwith PCOS ( 9 ). This may be due to various reasons,\nincluding high body mass index (BMI) and the demoralization experienced by patients with\nPCOS ( 10 ). The symptoms of PCOS, when severe, may\nlead to social withdrawal of patients. Increased BMI, hyperandrogenism, infertility, and\ninsulin resistance (IR) have been reported to contribute to the exacerbation or development\nof depressive and anxiety symptoms in adult women with PCOS ( 11 ). The emotional well-being of adolescent girls with PCOS has not been evaluated\nin detail, and few studies in this age group have investigated the components of PCOS\nassociated with depression.  In this study, we aimed to analyze the depressive and anxiety states of adolescent girls\nwith PCOS and to investigate the relationship between psychological state and health-related\nquality of life (HRQoL) and the clinical/biochemical characteristics of this population.    Materials and Methods   Study design  This was a cross-sectional, multicenter, case-control study. A total of 100 participants,\naged 13\u201318 yr, were included in the study. Of the participants, 51 were categorized into\nthe PCOS group. This group comprised adolescent girls who were diagnosed with PCOS and\nadmitted to the pediatric endocrinology clinic of \u00c7i\u011fli Regional Training Hospital and\nAkdeniz University Hospital. The control group consisted of 49 age-matched healthy\nvolunteers who visited our hospitals for primary health-care services (e.g., vaccination).\nParticipants in the control group had no menstrual irregularity or psychiatric disease and\nno clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. All participants (control and PCOS groups) were\nliving in the city center and were secondary or high school students. The previous\nclinical evaluations, health reports, and prescriptions of the participants in the control\ngroup were examined through a national data system called \u201ce-nabiz,\u201d which is supported by\nthe Turkish Ministry of Health. Adolescent girls who had previously visited the psychiatry\nclinic and who had been diagnosed with any psychiatric disease and were using psychiatric\nmedications were excluded from the control group. In cases in which the existence of a\npsychiatric problem was noticed for the first time after the questionnaire survey, the\npatients were referred to the psychiatry clinic for a detailed evaluation. The other\nexclusion criteria for both the PCOS and control groups were as follows:\nhyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, androgen-secreting tumors,\nlate-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cognitive disability, and presence of any other\ncoexisting chronic illness. Participants who were using any medication that may affect the\npsychological evaluation, such as antidepressants, melatonin, or stimulant drugs, were\nalso excluded from the study. Participants who were born small for gestational age or\npremature were also excluded because they may have several other accompanying problems.\nThe psychological features of the PCOS group were compared with those of the control\ngroup. The relationship between clinical/biochemical parameters and psychiatric scores was\nalso investigated in the PCOS group.    Definitions and diagnosis of PCOS  We determined the diagnosis of PCOS according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of PCOS in adolescents ( 7 ). The diagnosis\nwas made in patients who had at least 2 yr since menarche and were admitted to the\nendocrine clinic with menstrual irregularity (oligomenorrhea: menstrual cycle > 45 d)\nand hyperandrogenism (biochemical: free testosterone [fT] level higher than the reference\nlevels of our laboratory; clinical: physical examination findings of hyperandrogenism,\nsuch as a modified Ferriman\u2013Gallwey [mFG] score of > 8). Pelvic ultrasound was not used\nfor the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescent patients who had < 8 yr since menarche because\nof the psychological multifollicular appearance of the ovaries during this period ( 7 ). Although ultrasonographic evaluation was not used to\ndiagnose PCOS in adolescents, it was performed to investigate possible coexisting\nabnormalities in the uterus and ovaries.    Clinical and laboratory investigations  Data on sociodemographic characteristics (age, age at menarche, and menstrual\nirregularities) and clinical characteristics (anthropometric measures and presence of\nacanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, or acne) were collected using a questionnaire. An\nelectronic scale was used to measure body weight with the participants wearing light\nclothes. A wall-mounted stadiometer was used to measure height in the upright standing\nposition and during deep inspiration. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height\nsquared (kg/m 2 ). The standard deviation scores (SDS) for height, weight, and\nBMI were measured according to the reference values for Turkish children ( 12 ). Patients with a BMI higher than the 95th\npercentile for age and sex according to Turkish children\u2019s reference values were defined\nas obese ( 12 ). The mFG scoring system was used to\nevaluate the severity of hirsutism ( 13 ). Hirsutism\nwas defined as an mFG score of \u2265 8. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita BC-418;\nTanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used to determine the percentage body fat (PBF).  Fasting glucose levels were measured using the hexokinase assay. Thyroid-stimulating\nhormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone\nsulfate, androstenedione, and prolactin were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay.\nFasting insulin, fT, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were measured using the\nradioimmunoassay method. A spectrophotometric method was used to measure the alanine\naminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Peripheral blood samples were\nobtained in the morning (08.00\u201309.00 a.m.) after a 10-hr fasting period between the 3rd\nand 5th days of menstrual bleeding. The homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was\ncalculated using the following formula: fasting insulin (\u00b5U/mL) \u00d7 fasting glucose (mg/L) /\n405, and a value > 4 was considered to indicate IR in participants in the pubertal\nstage ( 14 ).    Psychiatric evaluation  A specialized child and adolescent psychiatrist performed the psychiatric evaluation. The\nfollowing inventories were administered to participants in both the case and control\ngroups.  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): BDI is a self-assessment measure\nconsisting of 21 items that evaluate the severity of somatic, emotional, mental, and\nmotivational symptoms of depression. In this inventory, each item is scored between 0 and\n3. High test scores indicate an increase in depressive symptoms ( 15 ). Total scores of 0\u20139 indicate no or minimal depressive symptoms;\n10\u201318, mild depressive symptoms; 19\u201329, moderate depressive symptoms; and 30\u201363, severe\ndepressive symptoms. The validity and reliability coefficients of the Turkish version of\nthe scale are similar to those of the original form ( 16 ).  State\u2013Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): This 40-item self-report scale\nassesses separate dimensions of anxiety: \u201cstate\u201d (STAI-S) and \u201ctrait\u201d (STAI-T). Items are\nrated on a four-point Likert-type scale. Scores range from 20 to 80 for each subtest, with\nhigher scores indicating higher anxiety levels ( 17 ). The Turkish version of this inventory has been proven valid and reliable in\nthe adolescent age group ( 18 ).  Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL): This inventory was\ndesigned by Varni et al . ( 19 ) to\nassess the HRQoL of children and adolescents. The 23-item PedsQL scale assesses physical\nand psychosocial functioning. Items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale. The\nreliability and validity of the scale has been confirmed by Cakin Memik et\nal . ( 20 ).    Ethics  Ethics committee approval was obtained for this study. Before the study, informed consent\nwas obtained from both the adolescent participants and their parents. The study was\nconducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Ethical Guidelines For\nMedical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects.    Statistical analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\n(SPSS for Windows, version 23.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous values are\nexpressed as median (interquartile range or mean \u00b1 standart deviation) whereas categorical\nvalues are expressed as numbers and percentages. Categorical variables were compared using\nPearson\u2019s chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests. The normality of distribution was evaluated\nusing the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. The distribution was also controlled when continuous\nmeasurements were compared. Normally distributed variables were compared using the t-test,\nand variables that did not show a normal distribution were compared using the Mann-Whitney\nU test. Pearson\u2019s correlation test was used to investigate the relationships between the\nvariables. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Multivariate linear regression\n(backward) models were used to assess independent determinants of psychiatric\nparameters.     Results  A total of 51 patients with PCOS and 49 controls completed the questionnaires and were\nincluded in the study. The mean age of the adolescents was similar between the PCOS and\ncontrol groups (15.72 \u00b1 1.32 vs . 15.53 \u00b1 1.77 yr, P = 0.890; Table 1 Table 1. Age and anthropometric measures of the participants  ). The height SDS was similar between the groups, whereas the weight SDS, BMI,\nand BMI SDS were significantly higher in the PCOS group (P = 0.290, P = 0.012, P = 0.002,\nand P = 0.020, respectively; Table 1 ).  The clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with PCOS are summarized in Table 2 Table 2. Clinical characteristics of patients with PCOS (N = 51)  . Oligomenorrhea was the most common complaint (56.8%) on admission. The\nobesity rate was 43.1% among patients with PCOS, and the mean PBF was 28.96 \u00b1 7.74%.\nHirsutism was present in approximately one of every two patients, whereas the incidence of\nacne and acanthosis was 23.5 and 19.6%, respectively. The laboratory characteristics of the\nPCOS group are shown in Table 3 Table 3. Laboratory characteristics of patients with PCOS (N= 51)  . The mean fasting plasma glucose level was 87.32 \u00b1 8.11 mg/dL, and the mean\ninsulin level was 15.43 \u00b1 9.63 UI/L. By calculating the HOMA-IR, the incidence of IR was\nfound to be 23.52%. In addition, an oral glucose tolerance test was performed in 12 patients\nwho had impaired fasting or postprandial glucose levels, and four of these patients were\ndiagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence of T2DM in our study group was\n7.8% (4/51).  The psychological scores of patients with PCOS are shown in Table 4 Table 4. Psychological scores of patients with PCOS  . Although the mean of the total BDI scores of adolescents with PCOS (mean,\n13.42 \u00b1 9.94) was higher than the BDI scores of controls (mean, 9.56 \u00b1 6.72), the difference\nwas not significant (P = 0.054, Table 4 ).\nConversely, 28.5% of the patients in the PCOS group had moderate-to-severe depressive\nsymptoms, whereas the incidence was significantly lower (8.3%) in the control group (P =\n0.021, Table 4 ). The STAI-S score was 40.77 \u00b1\n10.44 and the STAI-T score was 44.60 \u00b1 13.16 in the PCOS group. Both scores were higher than\nthose in the control group, which indicates that adolescent girls with PCOS were more likely\nto have anxiety (P = 0.010 and P = 0.030, respectively; Table 4 ). The physical PedsQL, psychosocial PedsQL, and total PedsQL scores were\nlower in the PCOS group (P = 0.020, P = 0.046, and P = 0.047, respectively; Table 4 ).  Correlational tests showed that the BDI score was significantly positively correlated with\nthe STAI-T and STAI-S scores but negatively correlated with all PedsQL scores (physical,\npsychosocial, and total scores), indicating that higher levels of depression were associated\nwith worse HRQoL (R = 0.683, P < 0.001; R = 0.885, P < 0.001; R = \u20130.405, P <\n0.001; R = \u20130.861, P < 0.001; and R = \u20130.756, P < 0.001, respectively). A significant\nnegative correlation was found between the STAI-S and PedsQL scores (physical, psychosocial,\nand total scores), indicating that higher anxiety levels were associated with worse HRQoL (R\n= \u20130.388, P = 0.012; R = \u20130.515, P = 0.001; and R = \u20130.502, P = 0.001, respectively). A\nsignificant negative correlation was also found between the STAI-T score and all PedsQL\nscores (R = \u20130.449, P = 0.003; R = \u20130.809, P < 0.001; and R = \u20130.750, P < 0.001,\nrespectively).  The serum fT levels were positively correlated with the BDI, STAI-T, and STAI-S scores and\nnegatively correlated with the psychosocial PedsQL and total PedsQL scores (R = 0.417, P =\n0.006; R = 0.402, P = 0.007; R = 0.472, P = 0.001; R = \u20130.461, P = 0.002; and R = \u20130.400, P\n= 0.008, respectively; Table 5 Table 5. Correlations between BDI, STAI-S, STAI-T, physical PedsQL psychosocial PedsQL,\ntotal PedsQL scores, and clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with\nPCOS  ). No significant correlations were observed between the levels of other\nandrogens and the psychiatric scores. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the fT\nlevel was significantly associated with the BDI score (r 2 = 0.190, adjusted\nr 2 = 0.149, P = 0.014; \u03b2-coefficient = 3.544, P = 0.014), psychosocial PedsQL\nscore (r 2 = 0.263, adjusted r 2 = 0.185, P = 0.018; \u03b2-coefficient =\n\u20136.705, P = 0.002), total PedsQL score (r 2 = 0.161, adjusted r 2 =\n0.119, P = 0.030; \u03b2-coefficient = \u20134.864, P = 0.030), STAI-S score (r 2 = 0.252,\nadjusted r 2 = 0.214, P = 0.003; \u03b2-coefficient = 3.643, P = 0.004), and STAI-T\nscore (r 2 = 0.174, adjusted r 2 = 0.133, P = 0.022; \u03b2-coefficient =\n4.513, P = 0.009) ( Table 6 Table 6. Multivariate backward linear regression analysis  ).    Discussion  In this study, we aimed to analyze the psychological state of adolescent girls with PCOS.\nTo provide a multidisciplinary approach to adolescents with PCOS, health professionals\nshould be aware that this patient population may have psychological problems. Revealing any\naccompanying psychiatric problems and providing necessary support will also be beneficial\nfor both the adolescent patients and their families in coping with the disease.  In this study, more depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed in adolescent girls\ndiagnosed with PCOS than in healthy participants. Some studies have also shown a higher\nincidence of emotional disturbance among adolescents with PCOS than among healthy\nadolescents ( 3 , 21 , 22 ). Sari et al .\n( 22 ) reported that the most common psychiatric\ndisorder in adolescents with PCOS was major depression, with an incidence of 30%. In our\nstudy, the incidence of moderate-to-severe depression was 28.5% in the PCOS group, which is\nconsistent with the literature.  The reasons for the high incidence of depression in patients with PCOS are not fully\nunderstood ( 23 ). One possible reason may be that\nadolescent girls are highly concerned about their physical features ( 24 ). A high BMI and unpleasant body features can lead to demoralization\nand social withdrawal of adolescents. Previous studies have reported obesity as a major\nfactor causing depressive symptoms in adolescents with PCOS ( 25 , 26 ). Depression may be independently\nassociated with BMI, as weight gain and obesity are distressing symptoms ( 27 ). Simon et al . ( 28 ) reported that obesity was associated with an approximately 25% higher\nodds of mood disorder in the general population. Although the obesity rate was higher\n(43.1%) in our study, no significant correlation was found between BMI and psychiatric\nscores. The small sample size may be the reason for this result, although some other studies\nfrom Turkey have reported similar results to ours ( 21 , 22 , 29 ). In those studies, patients with PCOS were also notably more overweight/obese\n(obesity rate, 41\u201352%) than controls, consistent with our results ( 22 , 29 ). One of the studies\nreported no difference in psychiatric scores between subgroups when patients with PCOS were\ndivided into the overweight/obese, normal weight, and underweight subgroups ( 29 ).  Several studies have also investigated the effects of IR on the psychological profiles of\npatients with PCOS ( 30 , 31 ). In a study in women diagnosed with PCOS, anxiety was found to be\nassociated with an increased incidence of IR ( 30 ). In\na recent meta-analysis, moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety symptoms were weakly\nassociated with IR ( 31 ). Contrary to the findings in\nthe adult population, we found no significant relationship between depressive/anxiety\nsymptoms and IR among adolescents with PCOS. Besenek and Gurlek ( 29 ) and Sari et al . ( 22 ) also did not find an association between IR and psychiatric scores in\nadolescent patients with PCOS. A possible reason for this result might be that the patients\nwere recently diagnosed with PCOS and have not been exposed to IR for a long time. Most of\nthe previous studies were conducted in the adult age group; thereby, such patients have been\nexposed to the effects of IR for several years.  Hirsutism has been reported to be a distressing feature among adult women with PCOS ( 31 , 32 ). In\ncontrast, a study conducted in an adolescent population reported no significant correlation\nbetween hirsutism and psychiatric scores ( 22 ).\nSimilarly, \u00c7oban et al . ( 21 ) found\nno significant relationship between self-esteem scores, PedsQL scores, and hirsutism in\nadolescent patients with PCOS ( 33 ). In the present\nstudy, we found no association between psychiatric scores and hirsutism. Another study found\na notable inconsistency in the perception of hirsutism between patients and clinicians:\npatients perceived their hirsutism as more severe than clinicians did ( 34 ). The authors also reported that the patient\u2019s own assessments of the\ndegree of hirsutism seemed more strongly associated with specific impacts on the quality of\nlife (QoL) and with the depression risk ( 34 ). This\nmay also explain our results. We did not find a relationship between physical aspects of\nhyperandrogenism and psychiatric scores, whereas the serum fT level, which is an objective\nindicator of hyperandrogenism, was positively correlated with the depression scores. Besenek\nand Gurlek ( 29 ) examined the effects of PCOS on\npsychological well-being and reported that the biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism\nmight be as effective as physical manifestations. However, the relationship between androgen\nlevels and psychiatric disorders in women remains controversial. As psychiatric disorders\nare more prevalent during the reproductive period in a woman\u2019s life, gonadal hormone levels\nhave been hypothesized to contribute to mood disorders through activational effects on the\nbrain ( 35 ). Although some previous studies suggested\nthat androgens influence mood ( 33 , 35 ), others found no association between androgens and\nmood iugn patients with PCOS ( 36 , 37 ). In terms of anxiety, some literature reports have\nshown the anxiogenic effects of testosterone ( 38 ),\nwhereas others have demonstrated its anxiolytic effect regardless of PCOS ( 39 ). A previous study in adults demonstrated that the\nanxiety scores were higher in patients with PCOS with hirsutism than in patients with PCOS\nwithout hirsutism ( 40 ). The study did not report\nwhether the higher anxiety level was related to social anxiety or to state\u2013trait anxiety.\nEmeksiz et al . ( 3 ) found that\nadolescents with PCOS have greater anxiety, especially social and generalized anxiety. We\nalso found a relationship between the serum fT level and the state\u2013trait anxiety scores,\nconsistent with the literature.  HRQoL is a multidimensional concept used to describe the physical, emotional, and social\naspects of diseases ( 19 ). PCOS symptoms may\nnegatively affect the patients\u2019 psychological and social well-being and sexuality, leading\nto a worsened QoL ( 41 ). A recent review showed that\nadolescent girls with PCOS have a reduced QoL relative to healthy girls, similar to our\nfinding ( 42 ). In one study, BMI and hirsutism scores\nwere reported to be associated with the physical aspects of QoL. However, the roles of\nbiochemical, endocrine, and metabolic parameters were reported to be less important ( 43 ). In the current study, serum fT levels were\nnegatively correlated with the psychosocial and total PedsQL scores.   Study limitations  Our study had some limitations. First, the control participants were not BMI-matched to\nthe patients with PCOS. This topic is controversial in the literature, with some studies\nincluding a BMI-matched control group ( 3 ) and others\nincluding a BMI-unmatched control group ( 22 , 29 , 44 ). This\nsituation is contradictory because obesity may be associated with depression or anxiety\nregardless of PCOS. The psychiatric scores of healthy participants may be higher in\nstudies with BMI-matched groups. In contrast, obesity may also affect the higher\npsychiatric scores in the PCOS group compared to control participants in BMI-unmatched\nstudies. Second, we did have not access to detailed sociodemographic characteristics of\nthe patient and control groups, such as family income and number of people living at home,\nwhich may be related to psychiatric scores. Third, psychological scores were obtained\nusing self-rating scales, and semistructured psychiatric interviews were not performed.\nHowever, our main objective was not to identify clinical psychiatric conditions.\nTherefore, self-rating scales for depressive and anxiety symptoms were used to evaluate\nthe association between psychiatric scores and clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical\ncharacteristics. Fourth, we did not evaluate PCOS-related QoL, which might have affected\nthe results. In a study examining the fertility concerns of adolescent girls with PCOS,\nconcerns about future fertility were found to be associated with significant reductions in\nQoL ( 45 ). Finally, the fT level was not\ninvestigated in the control group because the mFG score of all control participants was\n< 8 and there were no other findings suggestive of hyperandrogenism (e.g., acne).     Conclusion  In the present study, we investigated the relationships among the severity of depression\nand anxiety; HRQoL; and clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics in\nadolescents with PCOS. More symptoms of depression and anxiety were observed in adolescent\ngirls diagnosed with PCOS than in healthy participants. The psychosocial QoL scores were\nalso lower in patients with PCOS. Our results showed that 28.5% of the patients with PCOS\nhad moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. We also found a positive correlation between\nserum fT levels and depression and state\u2013trait anxiety scores and negative correlations\nbetween serum fT levels and psychosocial and total QoL scores. Further studies are needed to\nverify these observations and to clarify the potential mechanisms underlying the observed\nrelationships.
