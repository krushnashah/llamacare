    "body": "INTRODUCTION  Demodex species are microscopic, obligate, elongated mites of the\nDemodicidae family, Acari order, and Arachnida class. Both Demodex\nfolliculorum (D. folliculorum) and Demodex brevis\n(D.brevis) are common colonisers of human skin, particularly the face,\nand occupy the pilosebaceous unit, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands. D. folliculorum is more prevalent, but D.\nbrevis has a wider bodily distribution. 1 , 2 Normal rates\nof colonisation have been estimated between 20% and 80%, increasing with age, and\nthey are considered part of the normal dermatological flora of the skin. 1 - 3 Their potential connection to skin diseases is controversial,\nwith many considering them to be coincidentally present in diseased skin, or to be\ntemporarily and opportunistically parasitic in the diseased state. 2 , 4 However, some evidence points to a contribution of Demodex to the pathogenesis of multiple skin disorders,\nincluding rosacea, blepharitis, and pustular folliculitis. 4 - 7 Oily or\nmixed skin appears to increase the risk of Demodex infestation. 8 It is also well-known\nthat Demodex mites are pathogenic in the context of\nimmunosuppression. 1 , 2 A potential link to acne, a disorder\nof the pilosebaceous unit, in humans is controversial. 4 , 9 However, a\nrecent meta-analysis of case control studies supported an association between Demodex infestation and acne vulgaris. 10  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5-10% of\nwomen of reproductive age and commonly features chronic anovulation and\nhyperandrogenism. 11 - 13 Hyperandrogenism is typically\nassociated with systemic effects, including acne, hirsutism, and central obesity. In\nwomen with PCOS, acne is predominantly distributed as inflammatory lesions on the\nlower face, neck, chest, and upper aspect of the back. 13 Women with PCOS are also at high risk of\ndepression and anxiety, which has a negative impact on their health-related quality\nof life. Acne has been identified as one of the factors potentially contributing to\nthe risk of affective disorders and a reduced quality of life in women with\nPCOS. 14 , 15  Given the association between PCOS and acne, as well as the proposed association of Demodex infestation with acne, we hypothesised that Demodex infestation may be more prevalent in women with PCOS\nand that there may be a link between Demodex and the presence of\nacne and/or oily skin in PCOS patients. One recent study on 30 PCOS patients and 30\nmatched healthy control subjects has shown that D. folliculorum infestation is increased in women with PCOS. 16 The objectives of this study were, therefore, to determine\nwhether or not the prevalence of Demodex mites was increased in a\nlarger group of women with PCOS and to examine the relationship between Demodex infestation and the presence of acne, as well as with\noily or dry skin types in PCOS patients.    METHODS  The study was carried out at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and at the\nDermatology Department, between May 2013 and August 2014.This study was approved by\nTurgut Ozal University Ethical Committee and complied with the Helsinki Declaration\nof 1975, as revised in 1983. All participants gave their written informed consent.\nThe study was designed as a case-control study, with 41 PCOS patients and 47\nnon-PCOS control subjects, matched for age, weight, and body mass index (BMI),\nenrolled in the study. Physical examination and transvaginal ultrasound were\nperformed on all women by same gynacologist. PCOS was diagnosed according to revised\n2003 Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) /\nAmerican Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) PCOS Consensus Workshop Group\ndiagnostic criteria. 12 The healthy\ncontrol group was composed of 47 females with regular menses, normal medical\nhistory, physical and pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound, and blood chemistry.\nNone of the PCOS or control patients had been on any medication for at least 3\nmonths prior to the study, including oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, ovulation\ninduction agents, or anti-diabetic and anti-obesity drugs. All subjects were\nexamined for dermatological lesions. The diagnosis of acne vulgaris was made based\non the presence of comedons, papules, pustules, and/or cysts. Three samples for mite\nexamination were taken from the inflammatory lesions of the acne on the forehead,\ncheeks, and jaw. Microscopic examination of mites was performed by cyanoacrylate\nglue standardized skin surface biopsy (SSSB) in both the patient and control groups.\nA slide covered with cyanoacrylate glue and a marked square was pressed against the\nskin surface. After 30sec, the slide was removed and the samples were collected. The\npreparation was inspected with the use of a light microscope at 40x and 100x\nmagnification. The result was considered positive when there were more than 5 D. folliculorum mites in a 1-cm 2 area by SSSB.  Facial skin types of the PCOS and control groups were classified as dry or oily.\nThere is no standardized quantitative method to reliably measure cutaneous sebum\nlevels; therefore, qualitative distinction between dry skin and oily skin is\ncommonly made in clinical practice through the interpretation of clinical signs,\nsuch as texture, hydration, sebaceous follicle dilatation, tendency to wrinkles and\npigmentation, shine, and oiliness. 17    STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences (SPSS) version 16.0 for Windows XP (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA ). Normal\ndistribution of measurement values was examined graphically and with the\nShapiro-Wilk test. The data were presented as mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation (SD)\nand analysed using the Student's t-test to determine whether differences between\nPCOS and control groups and between subgroups were significant. P\u22640.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.    RESULTS  There was no significant difference between the PCOS and control groups in terms of\nBMI, weight and median age ( Table 1 ).

The rate of oily skin was similar for the two\ngroups, at 70.7% of PCOS patients and 74.5% for controls (p=0.811); 53.7% of the\nPCOS group were D. folliculorum positive, while 31.9% of the\ncontrol group were D. folliculorum positive, determined to be\nstatistically significant at the limit (p=0.052) ( Table 2 ).

Both the control and PCOS groups were separated into two subgroups each according to\nwhether or not acne was diagnosed by dermatological examination. When these four\nsubgroups were assessed separately, in the control group no significant association\nwas found between D. folliculorum positivity and having acne or not\n( Table 3 ; p=0.553). By contrast, in the\nPCOS group, there was a significant association between being Demodex positive and having acne vulgaris versus not having\nacne vulgaris (p=0.003) ( Table 3 ). A\nsignificant difference was also found in terms of D. folliculorum positivity between those in the PCOS group who have acne versus both subgroups of\nthe control group (p=0.007 and p=0.001, respectively), but no significant difference\nwas found between those who did not have acne in the PCOS group and both subgroups\nof the control group (p=1.000 and p=0.559, respectively) ( Table 3 and Figure 1 )   Table 3   Distribution of Demodex positivity by subgroups              Demodex     Group    negative  positive  p      Control-acne  Count  19  7  0.003    negative  % group  73.1  26.9        % Demodex  37.3  18.9      Control-acne  Count  13  8      positive  % group  61.9  38.1        % Demodex  25.5  21.6                  PCOS - acne  Count  17  10      negative  % group  63.0  37.0        % Demodex  33.3  27.0      PCOS -acne  Count  2  12      positive  % group  14.3  85.7        % Demodex  3.9  32.4         PCOS: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; P\u22640.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.      Figure 1 D. folliculorum positivity according to the presence or\nabsence of acne    D. folliculorum positivity was also assessed according to skin type\nin all cases. While 69% Demodex positive patients in the PCOS group\nhad oily skin, significantly fewer (16.7%) had dry skin (p=0.005). In the control\ngroup, while 40% of Demodex positive patients had oily skin, 8.3%\nhad dry skin (p=0.071; Table 4 ). When\npatients with an oily skin type from both the PCOS and the control groups were\ncompared for Demodex positivity, the difference between them was\nstatistically significant ( Table 4 ; p=0.026).\nIn patients with dry skin types, there was no significant difference between the\ncontrol and the PCOS groups in terms of Demodex positivity ( Table 4 ; p=1.000, Figure 2 ).

Figure 2 D. folliculorum positivity according to the dry or oily\nskin type      DISCUSSION  In this study, we aimed to determine whether the prevalence of D.\nfolliculorum mites was increased in women with PCOS, and to examine the\nrelationship between Demodex infestation and the presence of acne,\nas well as with oily or dry skin types, in PCOS patients. The results showed that a\nsignificantly higher prevalence of D. folliculorum infestation was\nfound in women with PCOS than in a control group matched for age, weight, and BMI.\nPrevalence of acne was also higher in the PCOS group and Demodex positivity was positively associated with the presence of acne in the PCOS group but\nnot in the control group. Prevalence of oily skin was comparable in the two groups,\nbut in the PCOS group, oily skin was significantly more likely to be associated with Demodex positivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to show differential association of Demodex positivity\nand acne, as well as with the oily skin type, in women with PCOS, as compared to the\ncontrols.  Any proposed association between acne and Demodex in the general\npopulation is controversial. Some studies have found no evidence of increased Demodex prevalence and acne vulgaris, and many consider Demodex mites to be opportunistic rather than causative\npathogens in skin diseases in general. 2 , 4 , 9 , 18 However,\nothers have proposed that there is an association between Demodex and acne. 19 Recent meta-analysis\nof case control studies indicated that there was a positive association between the\namount of Demodex infestation and the presence of acne\nvulgaris. 10 While this\ndoes not prove a causative association, it does suggest that in cases where standard\nacne treatment is unsuccessful, consideration should be given to the presence of Demodex mites and the possible efficacy of acaricidal\ntherapies. One double-blind, controlled clinical trial of acaricidal medications\nshowed the efficacy of these medications in the treatment of 100 acne-like\ndemocidosis cases. 20 However,\nthere is a lack of studies in English on the potential effectiveness of\nanti- Demodex medications in acne treatment or even of the\npotential pathogenic role of Demodex mites in acne.  The results of our study suggest that there is a differential association of D. folliculorum infestation with acne in PCOS patients as\ncompared to the controls. PCOS is frequently associated with acne, which is thought\nto contribute to affective disorders and a reduced quality of life in women with\nPCOS (14,15).One recent study on 30 PCOS patients and 30 matched healthy control\nsubjects showed an increased prevalence of D. folliculorum infestation in women with PCOS. 16 Our study confirmed that D. folliculorum infestation is more\nprevalent in PCOS patients as compared to the controls. We also showed that there is\nan association between the occurrence of acne in women with PCOS and the presence of Demodex mites, which was not present in the controls, which in\nturn suggests that in these patients the Demodex infestation could\nbe contributory to the pathogenesis of acne. Oily or mixed skin appears to increase\nthe risk of Demodex infestation. 8 In our study, there was no significant difference between\nPCOS and the control groups for the prevalence of the dry skin type. However, the\nPCOS group presented a significantly higher association between oily skin and the\npresence of Demodex mites than did the control group. This again\nsuggests that some aspect of the hormonal, metabolic, or inflammatory changes in\nPCOS patients increases the likelihood of Demodex infestation over\nand above other risk factors, such as the oily skin type.    CONCLUSION  The present study has shown an association between PCOS and D.\nfolliculorum positivity and, more importantly, a further association of D. folliculorum positivity and the presence of acne in PCOS but\nnot in control patients. The literature in general is limited and divided on the\npossible connections between Demodex and acne. The results of our\nstudy suggest that PCOS is a condition in which this connection may have\npathological significance. This study is limited by the relatively small number of\nsubjects and the observational nature of the study design. Larger observational\nstudies on the prevalence of Demodex in women with PCOS are\nwarranted, especially as regards its association with acne, in order to determine if\nacaricidal therapies can be effective in the treatment of acne in PCOS.",
