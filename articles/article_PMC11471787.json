    "body": "Introduction  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) stands out as one of the most prevalent endocrine abnormalities, affecting 6\u201320% of women globally within their reproductive years 1 . The presentation of PCOS is notably intricate and heterogeneous, with clinical diagnosis primarily relying on three key characteristics: the presence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA), chronic ovulatory dysfunction (OD), and ultrasound-indicated polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) 2 . The 1990 US National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria initially defined PCOS as the presence of both HA and OD, while the 2003 Rotterdam criteria expanded this definition to include the diagnosis of PCOM, requiring the presence of at least two of the three characteristics 3 . Subsequently, mounting evidence suggested that HA might involve in major pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PCOS, leading the 2006 Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) Position Statement to assert that PCOS should primarily be considered a disorder of androgen excess or HA 5 , 5 .  Hyperandrogenism emerges as a crucial pathophysiological mechanism underlying the development of PCOS. Recent studies have highlighted that HA not only serves as a major driver of female OD and dermatological manifestations but also fosters adipose tissue accumulation and metabolic dysfunction by triggering insulin resistance and subsequent compensatory hyperinsulinism 6 \u2013 9 . Testosterone (T), among the most prevalent androgens in women, predominantly arises from the conversion of androstenedione produced by the female ovaries and adrenal cortex 10 . Within the human body, the overwhelming majority (~\u200998%) of T binds to albumin or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), with only a minute fraction (1-2%) existing as free serum T 11 . In clinical settings, circulating free T, calculated from total T and SHBG, is widely regarded as the most reliable marker for HA in PCOS patients 12 . Bioavailable T is the sum of free T and those weakly bound to albumin and hence has similar clinical significance to free T. Despite the pivotal role of T in the pathological regulation of PCOS, the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive.  Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have yielded significant breakthroughs in human genetics, fostering a deeper understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases 13 . Recent GWASs have specifically targeted PCOS and T-related traits, uncovering numerous susceptibility loci that elucidate the genetic basis and biological mechanisms underlying both conditions 14 , 15 . However, to date, no studies have elucidated a shared genetic architecture between the two. This study aims to explore the genetic correlation and polygenic overlap between PCOS and three T-related traits\u2014total T, bioavailable T (the sum of free T and non-specific binding albumin), and SHBG\u2014utilizing linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) and bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) methodologies. Furthermore, we seek to identify shared risk genetic loci between PCOS and T-related traits using the cond/conjunctive false discovery rate (conjFDR) method.    Results   Genetic overlap between PCOS and T-related traits  LDSR analysis revealed a notable positive genetic correlation between total T and PCOS (r g = 0.212, P =\u20091.64\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221210 , Table 1 ) and an even stronger positive correlation between bioavailable T and PCOS (r g = 0.433, P =\u20091.05\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22125 ). Conversely, SHBG exhibited a negative correlation with PCOS (r g = -0.395, P =\u20097.64\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221214 ). Bivariate MiXeR analysis confirmed these findings and provided more precise genetic correlations by accounting for mixtures of effect directions (Table 1 ). The results demonstrated extensive polygenic overlap between PCOS and T-related traits. Out of the 0.56\u00a0K variants predicted to influence total T, 0.55\u00a0K variants were also predicted to impact PCOS (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Bioavailable T shared 0.66\u00a0K variants with PCOS, representing 68% and 43% of the genetic basis of bioavailable T and PCOS, respectively. SHBG also shared numerous variants with PCOS, with approximately 95% of predicted variants (0.60\u00a0K/0.63\u00a0K) influencing PCOS. Conditional Q-Q plots displayed successive leftward deflections of the curves for T-related traits, indicating a robust enrichment of T-related variants in PCOS, while the impacts were less pronounced for PCOS-related variants on T traits (Fig. 2 ).

PCOS: polycystic ovary syndrome; T: testosterone; SHBG: sex hormone-binding globulin.       Shared loci between PCOS and T-related traits  We further utilized the polygenic enrichment between PCOS and T-related traits to identify shared genomic loci using the cond/conjFDR framework. Employing a conjFDR threshold of <\u20090.05, we pinpointed four lead SNPs jointly associated with PCOS and total T (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ). Among these SNPs, three exhibited the same direction of effect on both PCOS and total T (Table 2 ). Additionally, bioavailable T and SHBG shared six and four lead SNPs with PCOS, respectively. Approximately 66.7% of the SNPs in the shared genomic loci exhibited the same direction of effect on PCOS and bioavailable T, while all four SNPs displayed opposite directions of effect on PCOS and SHBG. Furthermore, several genomic loci were shared among different T-related traits. For instance, a locus on chromosome 11 (rs11031005 and rs11031006) was jointly associated with all three T-related traits as well as PCOS, with consistent effect directions (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ).

PCOS: polycystic ovary syndrome; T: testosterone; SHBG: sex hormone-binding globulin.      Functional annotation  Functional annotation of the lead SNPs shared by PCOS and T-related traits indicated that they were predominantly intergenic or intronic. The only SNP located in an exon region was rs695872, situated within ATXN2, with a considerably high CADD score (>\u200912.37), suggesting high deleteriousness. Another locus with a high CADD score was rs11031006, jointly associated with total T and bioavailable T. Its nearby variant, rs11031005, was significantly associated with SHBG. This locus resides in a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) segment, with the nearest gene, FSHB, encoding the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), suggesting a potential role in regulating PCOS and T-related traits through FSH synthesis.    Discussion  This study offers a comprehensive exploration of genomic-wide genetic correlations and polygenic overlaps between PCOS and three T-related traits. Our findings reveal positive associations between total T and bioavailable T with PCOS, while the genetic correlation between SHBG and PCOS is negative. MiXeR analysis unveils substantial genetic overlap between PCOS and T-related traits, with approximately 68\u201398% of variants influencing PCOS originating from T-related traits. Leveraging these polygenic enrichments, we identify multiple genomic loci jointly associated with PCOS and T-related traits. These discoveries shed light on a shared underlying biological mechanism between T regulation and PCOS etiology, offering insights into pathogenesis and potential novel drug targets for PCOS.  Our results were consistent with clinical observations that PCOS was highly associated with hyperandrogenism, showing elevated T levels and decreased SHBG levels in laboratory examination. Our genetic analysis aligns with these observations, demonstrating positive correlations between PCOS and both total T and bioavailable T, while the genetic correlation between PCOS and SHBG is negative. Notably, T and SHBG concentrations are intricately linked. SHBG serves as a sex hormone transporter with high affinity for T, thereby regulating its bioavailability and activity 16 . Factors influencing SHBG production include age, estrogen, thyroid hormones, liver disease, obesity, insulin resistance, and androgens 17 , 18 . Consequently, PCOS may arise from a combination of metabolic abnormalities leading to decreased SHBG levels or excess androgens.  We further identified several shared genomic loci between PCOS and T-related traits through the utilization of their polygenic enrichment. Among these loci, we pinpointed one where rs11031005 and rs11031006 were jointly associated with PCOS and all three T-related traits. This locus encompasses a segment of lncRNA situated within the FSHB gene region. FSHB stands out as a well-documented PCOS GWAS risk gene, encoding the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 19 , 20 . Notably, FSH shares its alpha subunit with other pituitary glycoprotein hormones, including luteinizing hormone (LH), chorionic gonadotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. The transcription of FSHB plays a pivotal role in FSH secretion 21 . While LH and FSH are both pituitary gonadotropins produced in the same cells and stimulated by hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 22 , their roles in human reproduction and steroid hormone regulation differ significantly. LH promotes the synthesis of T from cholesterol, whereas FSH facilitates the conversion of T to estrogens 22 . Thus, a plausible hypothesis emerges suggesting that genetic alterations leading to decreased FSHB expression may elevate the circulating LH/FSH ratio, thereby promoting androgen accumulation and ultimately contributing to PCOS.  ATXN2 is also a potential target for regulating T and PCOS. As shown in Table 2 , rs695872 is a lead SNP located in the exon region of ATXN2 with high CADD score of 16.14 (>\u200912.37). Actually, the ATXN2 gene locus variants have long been associated with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Mouse studies also show the knock-out of ATXN2 to lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia 23 . Moreover, a recent study found the hypothalamic expression of ATXN2 was a determinant for weight and metabolism, and was supposed to regulate metabolism through the regulation of clock gene expression 24 . Considering that the hypothalamus is the center for metabolic homeostasis, the ATXN2 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS by influencing hypothalamic hormone release.  However, our study has several limitations. Firstly, despite the widespread belief that free T is the most sensitive predictor of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, we were unable to include this indicator due to limitations in the original data sources. Nonetheless, we opted for bioavailable T as an alternative and achieved consistent results aligning with those expected for free T. Secondly, all participants included in our analysis were of European ancestry, thus restricting the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Thirdly, the diagnostic criteria of PCOS included some patients who did not present hyperandrogenism. We are currently unable to determine the association between T and non-hyperandrogenic type of PCOS. Fourthly, while we identified several causal risk variants jointly associated with T regulation and PCOS and proposed plausible conjectures, further studies are necessary to validate these hypotheses.    Conclusions  The genome-wide cross-trait investigation confirms the significant role of elevated T levels in PCOS pathogenesis. The findings reveal extensive genetic overlap between PCOS and T-related traits, with a substantial proportion of T-related variants predicted to influence PCOS. The shared loci suggest common biological mechanisms, such as our proposition that FSHB may represent a promising target for understanding T-related abnormalities and PCOS.   Methods   GWAS samples  Summary datasets for PCOS were obtained from the largest GWAS meta-analysis, encompassing 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European descent 14 . These samples were drawn from seven cohorts, with PCOS diagnosis based on either NIH or Rotterdam criteria. Summary datasets for total T, bioavailable T, and SHBG were sourced from the UK Biobank, comprising data from 425,097 participants. Total T and SHBG levels were measured using a Beckman Coulter Unicel Dxl 800, while bioavailable T was computed using the Vermeulen Eq.\u00a02 5 . To mitigate sex bias, we extracted only female-specific GWAS summary statistics, totaling up to 230,454 subjects. Ethical approval for all included GWASs was obtained from local ethics committees, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.      LDSR and MiXeR analysis  We initiated our analysis with LDSR to estimate genetic correlations between PCOS and T-related traits 26 . LDSR employs a regression-based model to estimate genome-wide genetic correlations by assessing the deviation of test statistics from null hypothesis expectations. However, LDSR may not capture all aspects of genetic overlap, including concordant or discordant effects of genetic variants 27 . Thus, we complemented this analysis with the bivariate MiXeR approach, which considers mixtures of effect directions to estimate polygenic overlap between PCOS and T 28 . Our results encompassed shared and trait-specific susceptible variants visualized through Venn diagrams, model-fitting comparisons between predicted and observed data via conditional quantile-quantile (Q\u2013Q) plots, and the dice coefficient measuring the extent of polygenic overlap between the two phenotypes.   Discovery of shared genomic loci  Subsequently, we employed the conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate (cond/conjFDR) method to pinpoint shared genomic loci between PCOS and the three T-related traits 29 . CondFDR, an Empirical Bayes-based strategy, recalibrates test statistics in a primary phenotype conditioned on those in a secondary phenotype, leveraging overlapping GWAS associations between the two phenotypes. For each variant, condFDR was calculated for the primary phenotype conditioned on the secondary phenotype, with the process repeated after switching primary and secondary phenotypes. The conjFDR was then determined as the maximum of these two condFDR values. Following prior recommendations, we utilized a conjFDR\u2009<\u20090.05 threshold to identify statistically significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with both PCOS and T-related traits. Notably, the extended major histocompatibility complex region (hg19, chr6:26\u00a0M-34\u00a0M) was excluded from analysis to mitigate inflation arising from complex LD patterns.    Functional annotation  We utilized FUMA for the functional annotation of candidate SNPs identified through the conjFDR approach 30 . Candidate SNPs were assigned to genes employing one of three strategies: (i) positional mapping to genes within a physical distance of less than 10\u00a0kb; (ii) functional association with gene expression based on expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) resources; or (iii) mapping to genes representing chromatin interactions. Additionally, SNPs underwent annotation using various resources, including the combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score\u2014a quantitative measure of deleteriousness integrating diverse annotations (a CADD score\u2009\u2265\u200912.37 was recommended to define deleterious coding SNPs) 31 \u2014and RegulomeDB to assess a variant\u2019s potential impact on regulatory function 32 . Chromatin states were also analyzed using 15 categorical states to predict their regulatory effects 33 .",
